1.10.010 Purpose.
The City Council finds that the enforcement of
the Municipal Code and applicable State and
Federal codes throughout the City is an important
public service. Code Enforcement is vital to the
protection of the public’s health, safety and quality
of life. The Council recognizes that enforcement
starts with the drafting of precise regulations that
can be effectively applied in administrative
enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. The
Council further finds that a comprehensive code
enforcement system that uses a combination of
judicial and administrative remedies is critical to
gain compliance with code regulations. Failure to
comply with an administrative code enforcement
action may require the City Attorney to file a
judicial action to gain compliance. It is the intent of
the City Council, in adopting this Chapter, to
provide for the maximum flexibility and discretion
on the part of City agents and employees in
obtaining code compliance. (Ord. 598 § 1, 1999)

of this Chapter.
C. “Director” means all the City Department
heads (i.e. the Director of Planning and Building,
the City Engineer, and the Chief of Police) the Chief
of the Ripon Consolidated Fire District and any of
their designated agents or representatives within
their jurisdictions.
D. “Enforcement Officer” means persons
authorized to act upon violations of the Ripon
Municipal Code within their jurisdictions, including
the Chief Code Compliance Officer and his/her
designee.
E. “Hearing Officer” means any person
appointed by the Administrative Officer to preside
over the administrative hearings provided for in
Chapter 1.12.
F. “Person” means any natural person, firm,
association, business, trust, organization,
corporation, partnership, trust, company, or any
other entity which is recognized by law as the

The City Council finds and determines that there
is a need for an alternative method of
enforcement for violations of the Ripon
Municipal Code. The Council further finds and
declares that an appropriate method of
enforcement for these types of violations is an
administrative citation program. The City
Council further finds that the facts and
circumstances surrounding its adoption of
amendments to this Chapter via Ordinance No.
___ (namely, the continuing public health crisis
surrounding the Covid-19 virus) constitute
emergency circumstances requiring immediate
action for the preservation of the health and safety
of the citizens of Ripon. The procedures for all
violations enumerated and established in this part
shall be in addition to criminal, civil, or any other
legal remedy established by law which may be
pursued to address violations of this Municipal
Code. (Ord. 526 § 1, 1994; Ord 896 § 1, 2020)

order which are adopted in calendar year 2020
(collectively, “2020 Emergency Orders”), may be
issued an administrative citation by an
enforcement officer as provided in this chapter.
(Ord 896 § 1, 2020)

constitutes a separate and distinct offense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of
alleged violations of any 2020 Emergency Order,

Chapter. (Ord 896 § 1, 2020)

by first-class mail to the violator(s), or the
property owner(s) or their agent(s), at the address

described above shall become effective on the
date of mailing.

administrative citation, the Director may cause to
be issued, in accordance with this section, an
administrative complaint containing all of the
required information in accordance with section
1.12.050. Such administrative complaint shall be

additional civil penalties.

amount of civil penalties imposed for the
violation(s).

citation and attempt to obtain the signature of the
1.12.050

violator or responsible party if they can be
located, as outlined in subsection 1.12.040-C.
(Ord. 526 § 5, 1994)
1.12.060 Appeal of Administrative Citation

receiving an administrative citation may appeal
the citation to the Director of the issuing
department and/or such Director’s designated
agent within the (10) business days from the date

state law, except that in the case of citations
issued for Category One violation of any 2020
Emergency Order, the appeal shall be automatic
and must be heard within 45 days, and in the case
of Category Two violations, the appeal must be
filed within 3 business days and heard within 7
business days. When an administrative citation

administrative citation, the director shall cause

all applicable codes and appropriateness.
C. If the reviewing department finds there are
grounds for cancellation, the findings shall be
entered on the record and the administrative
citation shall be cancelled.
D. Results of the initial review shall be sent to
the contesting party within fifteen (15) days from
the date the request is received.
E. If the contesting party is dissatisfied with the
result of the initial review the contesting party

of the initial review or within the time frame
specified by state law, request an administrative
hearing. The request for an administrative
hearing shall be made in writing, specifying the
grounds for contesting the results of the initial
review, and depositing the full amount of all
applicable civil penalties and a $25.00 fee to
cover the cost of the hearing. As soon as
practicable after receiving the request for an
administrative hearing, the Administrative
Officer shall appoint a hearing officer. The
hearing officer shall fix a date, time, and place for
the hearing, but in no instance shall such hearing
be set later than forty-five (45) days after the
request is received. Written notice of the time
and place of the hearing shall be served not less
than five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing,
unless otherwise provided elsewhere in this code,
to the party responsible for the violation and
anyone else who received notice of the citation by
any one of the following means:
1. personal service
2. first-class mail; or
3. posting the Notice of Hearing conspicuously
on or in front of the property on which the
violation is located.
The failure of any person with an interest in the
property to receive such notice shall not affect the
validity of any proceedings taken under this
section. Service by first-class mail in the manner
described above shall become effective on the
date of mailing.
F. Failure of any person to request an
administrative hearing in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall constitute a waiver
of such person’s right to an administrative
hearing for adjudication of the administrative
citation, or any portion thereof, and adjudication
of the total amount of the civil penalty.
G. The hearing officer shall consider any
written or oral evidence consistent with its rules
and procedures for public hearings regarding the
following issues:
1. the Director shall present information or
testimony relating to the violation and the
appropriate means of correcting the violation;
2. the owner or agent or person responsible for
the violation or any other interested person may
present testimony or evidence concerning the
violation and the means and time frame for
correction.
H. The Administrative Officer and/or his
designee shall establish and promulgate all
appropriate rules and procedures for conducting
hearings and rendering decisions pursuant to this
section.
1.12.060
6-9 (06/20)
I. The decision of the hearing officer regarding
any appeal shall be the final and binding
administrative order and decision. The right to
appeal the final decision of the hearing officer to
a court of law shall be governed by applicable
Federal, State, County, or City laws.
J. The hearing officer may reduce, waive, or
conditionally reduce the civil penalties stated in
the citation or any late fees assessed, but in no
event shall the hearing officer reduce said civil
penalty below the minimum amount established
by resolution of the City Council. The hearing
officer may also impose conditions and deadlines
by which violations must be corrected and out
standing civil penalties must be paid.

scheduled time and place for the administrative
hearing shall not preclude the hearing officer
from conducting the hearing at such time.

continuance of the hearing time and date. (Ord.
526 § 6, 1994; Ord. 533 §1 (part) 1995; Ord. 541

1.12.070 Civil Penalty
A. The City Council shall, by resolution, fix or
establish from time to time the amounts of civil
penalties to be assessed for administrative
citations issued.
B. If the violator or property owner fails to
correct the violation, subsequent administrative
citations may be issued for the same violation(s).
C. The amount of civil penalty assessed for
each administrative citation issued for a
reoccurrence of the same violation(s) shall be in
an amount as may be fixed or established from
time to time by resolution of the City Council.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the civil penalty
for violation(s) of any 2020 Emergency Orders
shall be as follows:
1. Category 1: Entity operating in violation of
the 2020 Emergency Orders, but following all
CDC guidance to provide safeguards to keep
workers and the public safe. Penalty is $25 per
occurrence.

the 2020 Emergency Orders and not following all
CDC guidance to provide safeguards to keep
workers and public safe. Penalty is $250 per
occurrence. (Ord 896 § 1, 2020)
D. Payment of the civil penalty shall not excuse
the failure to correct the violation nor shall it bar
further enforcement action by the City, including
injunctive relief as appropriate. (Ord 896 § 1,
2020)
E. All civil penalties assessed shall be payable
to the City of Ripon or as otherwise noted on the
administrative citation.
F. The failure of any person to pay a civil
penalty assessed by administrative citation within
the time specified on the citation shall result in
the assessment of an additional late fee to be
charged, the amount of which shall be set by
resolution of the City Council. (Ord 896 § 1,
2020)
G. The failure of any person to pay a civil
penalty assessed by administrative citation within
the time specified on the citation may result in the
filing a claim with the small claims court or
pursuing any other legal remedy to collect such
penalty. (Ord 896 § 1, 2020)
H. If the failure by any person to pay a civil
penalty assessed by administrative citation results
in the filing of an action with the small claims
court or any other court to collect the civil
penalty, the Director shall be entitled to collect all
costs associated with the filing of such action,
including, but not limited to, filing fees, court
costs, and any attorney’s fees. (Ord. 526 § 7,
1994 and Ord. 533 §1 (part) 1995)
1.12.080 Allocation of Administrative Civil
Penalties

manner described in this part shall be deposited
in either the General Fund or the applicable fund
pursuant to which the original administrative
citation was issued. (Ord. 526 § 8, 1994)
1.12.090
6-10 (06/20)
1.12.090 Incompatible Provisions;
Severability
To the extent any provision of this chapter is
incompatible with, or at variance with, any prior
adopted ordinance or resolution, the provisions of
this chapter shall take precedence, and all prior
ordinances shall be interpreted to harmonize with
and not change the provisions of this part. If any
section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause,
phrase, or word of this chapter is declared by a
court of competent jurisdiction, adjudication to a
final determination, to be void, this City Council
finds that said voided part is severable, and that
this City County would have adapted the
remainder of this part without the severed and
voided part, and that the remainder of this part
shall remain in the full force and effect. (Ord. 526

A. Each member of the City Council
shall receive a monthly salary, based upon the
population of the City, in the amount specified in
Section 36516(a)(2) of the California Government
Code, or any amendments thereto. In the event
Section 36156(a)(2) of the California Government
Code is amended to provide an increase in the
salaries of the City Council members, the City
Council may consider whether to accept said
increase at a public meeting after considering public
input. Thereafter, the City Council may adopt a
resolution approving said increase, or a portion of
said increase.
B. Each member of the City Council shall also
be entitled to receive health benefits at the same
level, and including the same coverage, as City
employees. Prior to approving any increase in the
cost of providing such benefits to City Council
members, the City Council may consider whether to
accept said increase at a public meeting after
considering public input. Thereafter, the City
Council may adopt a resolution approving said
increase, or a portion of said increase. (Ord. 387 §

2.04.020 Mayoral Selection
A Each City Council seat shall be numbered
from 1 to 5. The seats numbers will never change.
1. Seat 1 shall always be the Mayor’s seat.
2. Seat 2 shall always be the Vice Mayor’s
seat.
B. In non-election years, at the first City
Council meeting in December of each year, the
Council Members shall move seats to the next lowest
number (i.e. the person placed in Seat 5 shall move
to Seat 4, the person placed in Seat 4 shall move to
Seat 3, etc.). As a result, each year, the outgoing
Mayor shall move to Seat 5 (subject to moving to a
lower seat pursuant to subsection C(2), below) and
the new Mayor shall be the person that has been
moved to Seat 1.
C. In election years, rotation of seats shall
occur at the Council reorganization meeting, which
follows official certification of the election results by
the County Registrar of Voter.
1. Re-elected Council Members shall move to
the next lowest open seat in the order held prior to
re-election.
2. A newly-elected Council Member (defined
as any person who is not re-elected to a successive
term) shall fill the highest open seat number. If there
is more than one (1) newly-elected Council Member,
seat placement shall be determined by the number of
votes the newly-elected Council Members received
during the election, such that the person who
received the highest number of votes shall be
assigned to the lowest numbered open Seat. Thus, if
there is one new newly-elected Council Member,
he/she shall fill Seat 5, and the outgoing Mayor shall
fill Seat 4. If there are two or more newly-elected
Council Members, they shall fill the highest
numbered seats, in an order to be determined as
provided in this subsection, and the outgoing Mayor
shall fill the next lowest seat below the
newly-elected Council Members.
D. After all seats are filled according to the
foregoing procedure, the Council Member in Seat 1
shall be asked to whether s/he is willing to accept the
appointment as Mayor. If the Council Member in
Seat 1 does not want to be Mayor, s/he can elect to
“pass,” in which case, each Council Member shall
again move seats to the next lowest number. This
process shall continue until such time as the Council
Member in Seat 1 agrees to accept the appointment
of Mayor.
City Council 8 (Ripon 12-13)
2.04.020
E. If a vacancy occurs on the Council for any
reason, other than as a result of the end of a Council
Member’s term, the remaining Council Member
shall move to the next lowest open seat only to the
extent necessary to ensure that Seat 5 shall be the
vacant seat. The person who fills the vacancy shall
be placed in Seat 5. If more than one vacancy occurs
on the Council, the seats shall be assigned to the
people who are elected or appointed, as appropriate,
to fill the vacancies in the order in which they are
elected or appointed. (Ord. 791 §1, 2012; Ord. 800,

Purpose-Applicability
The following rules of procedure are
hereby established for City Council meetings
and meetings of Commissions established under
the Ripon Municipal Code. These rules are
intended to create an atmosphere in which the
members of the City Council and its
Commissions can conduct business efficiently,
fairly and with full public participation. It is the
duty of each member of the body and the Chair
to maintain common courtesy and decorum in
meetings. These rules are guided by 4 basic
principles, as set forth in "Rosenburg's Rules of
Order":
1. Rules should establish order.
2. Rules should be clear.
3. Rules should be user-friendly.
4. Rules should enforce the will of the
majority, while protecting the rights of the
minority.
(Ord. 854, 2016)
2.06.020 Role of the Chair
The Chair is responsible for applying
the rules and procedures established in this
Ordinance. Decisions by the Chair as to
application of the rules are final, unless
overruled by the majority of the City Council or
Commission. (For purposes of these rules, the
Mayor serves as the Chair of City Council
meetings.) All questions or communications
with staff or members of the public should be
directed through the Chair. The Chair should
take a less active role in debate and discussion,
but retains full rights to do so. The Chair can
make and second motions on any matter before
the City Council or Commission.
(Ord. 854, 2016)
2.06.030 Basic format for Agenda Item
Discusson
Items to be discussed and decided by the
City Council or Commission should ordinarily
be handled by the Chair in the following basic
format.
A. The Chair should clearly
announce the agenda item by number, and
should clearly state what the subject is. The
Chair should also announce the format that will
be followed. For example, if the item requires a
public hearing, the Chair will explain the
hearing procedure. At this point, individual
Council members or Commissioners should
disclose any contacts with proponents,
opponents or members of the public as to the
particular agenda item.
B. The Chair should ask for a
report by the City Staff. Other staff members
may also comment at this time, as appropriate.
Staff may also provide its recommendation at
this time.
C. The Chair should ask if any
members of the City Council or Commission
have questions or need clarification on the
agenda item. Staff should be given a full
opportunity to respond to these questions or
requests for clarification.
D. The Chair should invite public
testimony on the agenda item. If the agenda
item requires a public hearing, the format should
allow the applicant(s) to make an initial
presentation, followed by speakers in favor of
the item. Following proponents, opponents of
the item are allowed to speak. Finally, the
applicant will be allowed present rebuttal
testimony. Rebuttal testimony should respond
specifically to points raised by opponents, and
should not introduce new subject matter. Under
most circumstances, only one rebuttal speaker
will be allowed, but the Chair retains discretion
to allow additional rebuttal speakers. In
addition, Council members or Commissioners,
through the Chair, may ask questions or request
2.06.030
8-3 (11/16)
clarification from any speaker at this time. At
the conclusion of the public comments, the
Chair should close the public hearing. The
public hearing should only be re-opened to the
extent it is necessary to clarify earlier testimony.
E. At the conclusion of the public
hearing or public comment period, City Staff
will summarize the testimony received, and will
respond to the evidence or arguments raised.
Staff will also review the findings necessary for
approval or disapproval, and will reiterate its
recommendation. Council members or
Commissioners, through the Chair, may ask
questions or request clarification from Staff at
this time.
F. The Chair should invite a
motion for action on the agenda item. If there is
no second to a motion within a reasonable time,
as determined by the Chair, the motion dies, and
a new motion should be made. Where findings
are required, the motion should specifically
reference the required findings, as set forth in
the Staff Report, and should indicate whether,
and why, the required findings either can or
cannot be made.
G. After a motion has been
properly made and seconded, the Chair should
invite discussion on the motion. Every Council
member or Commissioner shall be permitted to
speak, but it is not necessary for them to do so.
H. After a reasonable opportunity
for discussion, the Chair should call for a vote
on the motion. A majority of the City Council
or the applicable Commission-that is, a
minimum of three votes-is required to approve a
motion. If a motion to approve an item fails to
attain three votes for passage, another motion
(either to deny the item, or continue to item to a
date certain) should be made and acted upon.
I. The Chair should announce the
result of the vote, and announce what action the
City Councilor Commission has taken. If there
is a right of appeal, the Chair should explain the
right of appeal, and the last date on which an
appeal may be filed.
(Ord. 854, 2016)
2.06.040 Reconsideration Policy
Reconsideration of a decision of the
City Council is limited to the following
situations and requires compliance with the
following procedures.
A. When the City Council makes a
final decision on any item other than quasiadjudicatory
actions (i.e. items involving
licenses or permits) reconsideration of the City
Council’s decision may only be requested by a
City Council member (including the Mayor)
who voted with the majority in the decision.
The request for reconsideration must be made at
the same meeting or the regularly scheduled City
Council meeting immediately following the
meeting at which the decision was made. The
City Clerk shall provide any necessary public
notice(s) and schedule the matter for
reconsideration at the next available meeting.
B. When the City Council makes a
final decision on quasi-adjudicatory items (i.e.
items involving licenses or permits), it is
understood that state laws and/or regulations
may govern the issue of reconsideration.
Otherwise, reconsideration of the City Council’s
decision may only be requested by a City
Council member (including the Mayor) who
voted with the majority in the decision. The
request for reconsideration must be made at the
same meeting at which the decision was made.
The City Clerk shall provide any necessary
public notice(s) and schedule the matter for
reconsideration at the next available meeting.
(Ord. 854, 2016)
2.06.050 Bringing Items Back for Further
Consideration
In some cases, the Mayor or a City
Council member may wish to bring back an item
which has previously been decided for further
consideration by the City Council. The purpose
of this policy is to balance the need for robust
debate and the ability to change based upon new
information with the need for finality and
certainty in the decision-making process.
A. Bringing Items Back to the
Same City Council.
The Mayor or a City Council member may
request that any item (other than quasiadjudicatory
items-i.e. items involving licenses
2.06.050
8-4 (11/16)
or permits) previously decided by the same City
Council (i.e. the membership of the City Council
has not changed) be brought back for further
deliberation and action. In such cases, the
Mayor or City Council member must specify in
writing any new information or changed
circumstances that warrant bringing the item
back to the City Council for further deliberation
and action. The City Administrator would be
responsible for putting together (or delegating,
as necessary) a staff report as necessary. The
Councilmember's written request may be an
attachment to the staff report or may be provided
as a stand alone attachment for the item.
B. Bringing Items Back-New City
Council.
In any instance where one or more City Council
members was not involved in the decision on
any given item (other than quasi-adjudicatory
items-i.e. items involving licenses or permits)
previously decided by the City Council, the
Mayor or any City Council member may request
that the item be brought back to the City Council
for further deliberation and action. In such
cases, he/she must do so in writing, using a form
to be provided by the City Clerk. The Mayor or
a City Council member may announce his/her
intent to place an item on an upcoming agenda at
a City Council meeting, but the request must
still be made using this procedure. The City
Administrator would be responsible for putting
together (or delegating, as necessary) a staff
report as necessary. The Councilmember's
written request may be an attachment to the staff
report or may be provided as a stand alone
attachment for the item.

C. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance
which imposes a tax and provides a measure

deviation from, the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the
State Board of Equalization in administering

D. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance
which can be administered in a manner that
will, to the degree possible consistent with the
provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the

cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and

than one place of business, the place or places

Controller, the State Treasurer, the State
Board of Control, the State Board of
Equalization, the State Treasury, or the

Equalization, in performing the functions
incident to the administration or operation of
this chapter; the substitution shall not be made
in those sections, including, but not
necessarily limited to, sections referring to the
exterior boundaries of the state, where the
result of the substitution would be to provide
an exemption from this tax with respect to
certain sales, storage, use or other con
sumption of tangible personal property which
would not otherwise be exempt from this tax
while such sales, storage, use or other
consumption remain subject to tax by the state
under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose
this tax with respect to certain sales, storage,
use or other consumption of tangible personal
property which would not be subject to tax by
the state under the provisions of that Code; the
substitution shall not be made in Sections
6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence
thereof), 6711, 7615, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the

(a) Person. "Person" means any individual,
firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social
club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver,
trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination
acting as a unit.
(b) Hotel. "Hotel" means any structure, or any
portion of any structure within the City, which is
intended or designed for lodging or sleeping
purposes wherein the owner or operator thereof
offers occupancy as defined in subsection (c) of this
section.
(c) Occupancy. "Occupancy" means the use or
possession, or the right to use or possession granted
by the owner or operator thereof for compensation of
any room or rooms or portion thereof for lodging or
sleeping purposes for a period of thirty (30)
consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions
of calendar days as full days.
(d) Transient. "Transient" means any person
who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy
by reason of concession, permit, right of access,
license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30)
consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions
of calendar days as full days. Any such person
exercising occupancy shall be deemed a transient
until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless
there is an agreement in writing between the
operator and the occupant providing for a tenure of
greater than thirty (30) days for compensation.
(e) Rent. "Rent" means the consideration
charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy

licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator
performs his/her functions through a managing agent

managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for
the purpose of this article and shall have the same
duties and liabilities as his/her principal. Compliance
with the provisions of this article by either the
principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
(g) Tax Administrator. "Tax Administrator"
means the City Clerk or Finance Director of the City
of Ripon. (Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)
3.16.030 Tax Imposed.

resolution or ordinance of the City Council, after
first having obtained voter approval in the same
manner as required by law. Said tax constitutes a
debt owed by the transient to the City which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to
the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the
operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share
of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The

2002)

discharge of official government business.

domicile equipped primarily for the care of aged or
infirm people.

under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)
3.16.050 Operator's Duties.

this chapter to the same extent and at the same time
as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the
amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall
receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No

period which may be established by the Tax
Administrator, make a return to the Tax
Administrator, on forms provided by the Tax
Administrator, of the total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected for
transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed,
the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted
to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
may establish shorter reporting periods for any
certificate holder if the Tax Administrator deems it
necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and
the Tax Administrator may require further
information in the return. Returns and payments are
due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to
this article shall be held in trust for the account of
the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)
3.16.080 Penalties.
(a) Delinquency. Any operator who fails to
remit any tax imposed by this article within the time
required shall, in addition to the amount of the tax,

tax per month or fraction thereof until paid; the
maximum penalty imposed on any one delinquency
shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the
amount of the tax.
(b) Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines
that the non-payment of any remittance due from any
transient or operator under this article is due to
intentional non-payment or fraud, a penalty of
twenty (20) percent of the amount of the tax shall be
added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in
subparagraph (a) of this section.
(c) Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty
imposed under the provisions of this section shall
become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.
(Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)
3.16.090 Failure to Collect and Report Tax.
(a) Determination of Tax by Tax Administrator.
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax
and to make, within the time provided in this article,
any report and remittance of said tax or any portion
thereof required by this chapter, the Tax
Administrator shall proceed in such manner as the
Tax Administrator may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base his/her estimate of the
tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall
procure such facts and information as the Tax
Administrator is able to obtain upon which to base
the assessment of any tax imposed by this article and
payable by any operator who has failed or refused to
collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, the Tax Administrator shall proceed to
determine and assess against such operator the tax
and penalties provided for by this article. In case
such determination is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by
serving it personally or by depositing it in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the
operator so assessed at his/her last known place of
address. Such operator may within thirty (30) days
after the serving or mailing of such notice make
application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time
prescribed, the tax and penalties, if any, determined
by the Tax Administrator shall become final and
conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give
not less than fifteen (15) days written notice in the
manner prescribed herein to the operator to show
cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why
said amount specified therein should not be fixed for
such tax and penalties. At such hearing, the operator
may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax and penalties should not be so fixed. After such
hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give
written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such
tax and penalties. The amount determined to be due
Transient Occupancy Tax 42 (2-03)

appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.16.100.
(Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the
Tax Administrator with respect to the amount of
such tax and penalties, if any, may appeal the
decision to the City Council. (Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)
3.16.110 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for
the collection and payment to the City of any tax
imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a
period of three (3) years, all records as may be
necessary to determine the amount of such tax as
he/she may have been liable for the collection of and
payment to the City, which records the Tax
Administrator shall have the right to inspect with the
operator's consent, or by use of a subpoena,
administrative subpoena, search or inspection
warrant. (Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)

penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or
has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this article it may be
refunded as provided in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of
this section provided a claim in writing therefor,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds
upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years of the date
of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished
by the Tax Administrator.
(b) An operator may claim a refund or take as
credit against taxes collected and remitted the
amount overpaid, paid more than once or
erroneously or illegally collected or received when
it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax
Administrator that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient or was exempt;
provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit
shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so
collected has either been refunded to the transient or
credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
(c) A transient may obtain a refund of taxes
overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or
illegally collected or received by the City by filing a
claim in the manner provided in subparagraph (a) of
this section, but only when the tax was paid by the
transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when
the transient having paid the tax to the operator,
establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax
Administrator that the transient has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the
tax.
(d) No refund shall be paid under the provisions
of this section unless the claimant establishes his/her
right thereto by written records showing entitlement
thereto. (Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)
3.16.130 Actions to Collect.
Any tax required to be paid by any transient
under the provisions of this article shall be deemed
a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such
tax collected by an operator which has not been paid
to the City shall be deemed a debt owed by the
operator to the City. Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this article shall be
liable to an action brought in the name of the City of
Ripon for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 664
§ 1, 2002)
3.16.140 Violations.
Any operator or transient who fails or refuses to
register as required herein, or fails or refuses to
furnish any return required to be made, or fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data
required by the Tax Administrator, or renders a false
or fraudulent return or claim or makes any false or
fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or
evade the determination of any amount due required
by this article shall be subject to one or both of the
civil penalties provided in Section 3.16.080, as
deemed appropriate by the Tax Administrator. (Ord.
664 § 1, 2002)
Transient Occupancy Tax 43 (2-03)
3.16.140
3.16.150 Disposition of Proceeds.
All moneys received by the City under or
pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be
deposited and paid into the General Fund of the City.
(Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)
3.16.160 Security for Collection of Tax.
(a) The Tax Administrator, whenever the Tax
Administrator deems it necessary to insure
compliance with this article, may require any person
subject thereto to deposit with the Tax Administrator
such security in the form of cash, bond, or other
security as the Tax Administrator may determine.
The amount of the security shall be fixed by the Tax
Administrator but shall not be greater than twice the
person's estimated average liability for the period for
which he/she files returns, determined in such
manner as the Tax Administrator deems proper, or
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), whichever
amount is the lesser. The amount of the security may
be increased or decreased by the Tax Administrator
subject to the limitations herein provided.
(b) If any operator liable for any amount under
this article sells out or quits his/her business or a
substantial portion thereof, his/her successors or
assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase
price to cover any transient occupancy tax which is
due against any portion of the business unless the
former operator produces a receipt from the Tax
Administrator showing that he/she has been paid or
a certificate stating that no amount is due. If the
successors or assigns of a business fail to withhold
the tax from the purchase price as required, they
shall be personally liable for the payment of the
amount required to be withheld by them to the extent
of the purchase price, valued in money. Said tax
shall be a lien against the purchase price for any
portion of the business. The successors or assigns
may request in writing a certificate of no tax due.
Within thirty (30) days after receiving a written
request from the successors or assigns for a
certificate, the Tax Administrator shall either issue
the certificate or mail notice to them at the address
given in the request of the amount that must be paid
as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of
the Tax Administrator to mail the notice will release
the successors and assigns from any further
obligation to withhold the purchase price as above
provided. The time within which the obligation of
the successors and assigns may be enforced shall
start to run at the time the operator sells out his/her
business or at the time that the determination against
the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs
later. (Ord. 664 § 1, 2002)

5.44.010 Intent.
The City Council hereby acknowledges that the
primary purpose of public sidewalks is to permit the
free and unobstructed right of travel by pedestrians.
However, the use of public walkways for limited
sidewalk dining areas can improve the business
environment and enhance the quality of life for
Ripon residents. so long as such use does not impede
travel and does not interfere with the rights of
adjoining property owners. Therefore, the City may
permit such uses after findings have been met that
applicants comply with the standards of this chapter.
For purposes of this chapter, sidewalk dining on the
public walkways shall only be permitted within the
C-1, C-2 and C-3 zones within the City of Ripon.

The City Council finds that the use of certain
public facilities, including but not limited to,
City parks and recreational facilities, the
Community Amphitheater, the Community
Center and the City Hall Council Chambers,
hereinafter referred to as “City Facilities”,
results in wear and tear and increases the
frequency of and need for maintenance on said
City Facilities. The City Council further finds
that fairness and equity require that individuals
and organizations who wish to utilize City
Facilities must be charged a fee to offset the
estimated reasonable costs incurred by the City
for wear and tear, increased maintenance and
other costs associated with such use.

personal injury or property damage claims
and litigation;
4. Ensure sidewalk vending
activities occur only in locations where such
activities would not restrict sidewalk and

Department, in addition to paying the other
charges and fees set out in Section 6.40.030, one
of the following must occur:
1. The Department shall have a veterinarian
spay or neuter the dog. The dog owner, guardian
or keeper shall pay a deposit of $100 prior to the

6.56.60
additional fees for any extraordinary care
provided.
2. In the alternative, the owner, guardian or
keeper shall arrange for another veterinarian
within the City or San Joaquin County to spay or
neuter and shall pay the Department a fee of $60,
which shall cover the Department's costs of
delivering the dog to a vet of the owner, guardian

his/her designee, the Director may release the
dog to the owner, guardian or keeper provided
that the owner, guardian or keeper signs an
affidavit that s/he will have the dog spayed or
neutered within two weeks and will provide
documentation verifying that the spaying or
neutering occurred upon completion. If the
owner, guardian or keeper fails to have his/her pit
bull spayed or neutered as agreed in the affidavit,
the Department shall have the authority to
impound the dog, and the owner, guardian or
keeper may be charged with a second violation
under 6.56.060(B), below.
4. In the event that the Director or his/her
designee determines that payment of any fees by
the owner, guardian or keeper of a pit bull which
is impounded or otherwise taken into custody
would cause extreme financial difficulty to the
owner, guardian or keeper, the Director or his/her
designee may, at his/her discretion, waive all or
part of the fees necessary for compliance with
this section.
B. A second violation of this section by the
owner, guardian or keeper, shall be a
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the

The Legislature of the State of California has in
Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and
65800 conferred upon local governments the
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of
Ripon does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord.
779 §1, 2010)
08.01.011 Findings of fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of Ripon are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by uses that
are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or
protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect
of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards
which increase flood heights and velocities also
contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord.
779 §1, 2010)
8.01.012 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable
regulations applied uniformly throughout the
community to all publicly and privately owned land
within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood
related erosion areas. These regulations are
designed to:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for
costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief
efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and
utilities such as water and gas mains; electric,
telephone, and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by
120 - 1 11/16
8.01.012
providing for the sound use and development of
areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future blighted areas caused by flood damage;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that
property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of
special flood hazard assume responsibility for their
actions. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.013 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this
ordinance includes regulations to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are
dangerous to health, safety, and property due to
water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or
velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods,
including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains,
stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or
which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)

utilities, the construction of streets, and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community
"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision"
means a manufactured home park or subdivision for
which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be

site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision" means the preparation of additional
sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the

1. A general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land
areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e.,
mudflows); and
2. The condition resulting from flood related
erosion.
"Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)"
means the official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or Federal
Insurance Administration has delineated both the
areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the
official map on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency or Federal Insurance
Administration has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazards and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.
“Flood hazard zone” means an area subject to
flooding that is delineated as either a special hazard
area or an area of moderate or minimal hazard on an
official Flood Insurance Rate Map issued by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. The
identification of flood hazard zones does not imply
that areas outside the flood hazard zones, or uses
permitted within flood hazard zones, will be free
from flooding or flood damage.
"Flood Insurance Study" means the official report
provided by the Federal Insurance Administration
that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate
Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
“Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land
area susceptible to being inundated by water from
any source - see “Flooding.”
"Floodplain Administrator" is the community
official designated by title to administer and enforce
the floodplain management regulations.
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an
overall program of corrective and preventive
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving
and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in
the floodplain, including but not limited to
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works,
floodplain management regulations, and open space
plans.
"Floodplain management regulations" means this
ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances (such as grading and
erosion control) and other application of police
power which control development in flood-prone
areas. This term describes federal, state or local
regulations in any combination thereof which
provide standards for preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage.
"Floodproofing" means any combination of
structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real
property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and

floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB
1-08, TB 2-08, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
more than one foot. Also referred to as "Regulatory
Floodway".
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on
either side of the "Regulatory Floodway" where
encroachment may be permitted.
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 6.0 of
this ordinance, means that the variance granted must
not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the Ripon City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed
120 - 3 11/16
8.01.020
building adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for fifty to one
hundred year Buildings that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are
subject during all those years to increased risk of
damage from floods, while future owners of the
property and the community as a whole are subject
to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and
suffering that those increased flood damages bring.
In addition, future owners may purchase the
property, unaware that it is subject to potential
flood damage, and can be insured only at very
high flood insurance rates.
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which
cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is
located or carried out in close proximity to water.
The term includes only docking facilities, port
facilities that are necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship
building and ship repair facilities, and does not
include long term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
"Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e.
county or municipality that is empowered to adopt
and implement regulations to provide for the
public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry.
"Hardship" as related to Section 6 of this
ordinance means the exceptional hardship that
would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The Ripon City Council requires that the
variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to
the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience,
aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an
exceptional hardship. All of these problems can
be resolved through other means without granting
a variance, even if the alternative is more
expensive, or requires the property owner to build
elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than
originally intended.
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural
elevation of the ground surface prior to
construction next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
"Historic structure" means any structure that is:

the Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
meeting the requirements for individual listing on
the National Register;
2. Certified or preliminarily determined by
the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the
historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by
the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic
district;
3. Individually listed on a state inventory of
historic places in states with historic preservation
programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
4. Individually listed on a local inventory of
historic places in communities with historic
preservation programs that have been certified
either by an approved state program as determined
by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the
Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an
earthen embankment, designed and constructed in
accordance with sound engineering practices to
contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to
provide protection from temporary flooding.
"Levee system" means a flood protection system
which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated
structures, such as closure and drainage devices,
which are constructed and operated in accord with
sound engineering practices.
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the
lowest enclosed area, including basement (see
“Basement” definition).
1. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
below the lowest floor that is usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement area, is not
considered a building’s lowest floor provided it
conforms to applicable non-elevation design
requirements, including, but not limited to:
a. The wet floodproofing standard in section
8.01.050.C.3;
b. The anchoring standards in section
8.01.050.A;

8.01.020
"Manufactured home" means a structure,
transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for
use with or without a permanent foundation when
attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a
"recreational vehicle". "Manufactured home park
or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more
manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
“Market Value” shall be determined by estimating
the cost to replace the structure in new condition
and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of
depreciation which has accrued since the structure
was constructed.
1. The cost of replacement of the structure
shall be based on a square foot cost factor
determined by reference to a building cost
estimating guide recognized by the building
construction industry.
2. The amount of depreciation shall be
determined by taking into account the age and
physical deterioration of the structure and
functional obsolescence as approved by the
floodplain administrator, but shall not include
economic or other forms of external obsolescence.
Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation
factors different from those contained in
recognized building cost estimating guides may be
considered only if such factors are included in a
report prepared by an independent professional
appraiser and supported by a written explanation
of the differences.
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the
National Flood Insurance Program, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North

construction" commenced on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations
adopted by this community, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
"New manufactured home park or subdivision"
means a manufactured home park or subdivision
for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum,
the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring
of concrete pads) is completed on or after the
effective date of floodplain management
regulations adopted by this community.
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any
dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, protection, excavation, channelization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence,
rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or
other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard
or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow
of water, or due to its location, its propensity to
snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water,
or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
"One-hundred year flood" or "100 year flood" - see
"Base flood”.
“Program deficiency” means a defect in a
community’s floodplain management regulations
or administrative procedures that impairs effective
implementation of those floodplain management
regulations.
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section
6 of this ordinance, means that the granting of a
variance must not result in anything which is
injurious to safety or health of an entire
community or neighborhood, or any considerable
number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any
navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or
basin.

river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without cumulatively increasing the
water surface elevation more than one foot.
120 - 5 11/16
8.01.020
“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure
or other development into compliance with State
or local floodplain management regulations, or, if
this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its
noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be
reduced include protecting the structure or other
affected development from flood damages,
implementing the enforcement provisions of the
ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar
violations, or reducing State or Federal financial
exposure with regard to the structure or other
development.
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or
resembling a river (including tributaries), stream,
brook, etc.
"Sheet flow area" see "Area of shallow flooding".
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area
in the floodplain subject to a 1 percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown
on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, and AE.
“Start of construction” includes substantial
improvement and other proposed new
development and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was
within 180 days from the date of the permit. The
actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns,
or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufacture home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling;
nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building
that is principally above ground; this includes a
gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
"Substantial damage" means:
1. Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred; or
2. Flood-related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a
10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such event, on the average, equals or
exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred. This is also
known as “repetitive loss.”
"Substantial improvement" means any
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the "start of construction" of
the improvement. This term includes structures
which have incurred "substantial damage",
regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations or state or
local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 2.
Any alteration of a "historic structure",
provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a "historic
structure".
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the
requirements of this ordinance which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this ordinance.
“Violation” means the failure of a structure or
other development to be fully compliant with this
ordinance. A structure or other development
without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in
relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum
(NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the
floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.030 Lands to which this ordinance
applies.
This ordinance shall apply to all areas of
special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the
City of Ripon. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1,
2010)
8.01.031 Basis for establishing the areas of
special flood hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the
City of Ripon dated December 16, 2005, with
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs), and Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps (FBFM’s), dated October 16, 2009, and all
subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this ordinance. This FIS and attendant
mapping is the minimum area of applicability of
this ordinance and may be supplemented by
studies for other areas which allow implementation
of this ordinance and which are recommended to
the Ripon City Council by the Floodplain
Administrator. The study, FIRM’s and FBFM’s
are on file at Ripon City Hall, 259 N. Wilma
Avenue, Ripon, CA 95366. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005;
Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.032 Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered without full compliance with the terms of
this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
Violation of the requirements (including violations
of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the
Ripon City Council from taking such lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.033 Abrogation and greater
restrictions.
This ordinance is not intended to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where
this ordinance and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1,
2010)
8.01.034 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this
ordinance, all provisions shall be:
A. Considered as minimum requirements;
B. Liberally construed in favor of the
governing body; and
C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any
other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord.
726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.035 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this
ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
ordinance does not imply that land outside the
areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This ordinance shall not create
liability on the part of the Ripon City Council, any
officer or employee
thereof, the State of California, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this ordinance
or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005)
8.01.036 Severability.
This ordinance and the various parts thereof
are hereby declared to be severable. Should any
section of this ordinance be declared by the courts

8.01.040 Designation of the floodplain
administrator.
The Director of Planning and Economic
Development is hereby appointed to administer,
implement, and enforce this ordinance by granting
or denying development permits in accord with its
provisions. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.041 Duties and responsibilities of the
floodplain administrator.
A. Permit Review. Review all development
permits to determine:
1. Permit requirements of this ordinance
have been satisfied, including determination of
substantial improvement and substantial damage
of existing structures;
2. All other required state and federal
permits have been obtained;
3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
4. The proposed development does not
adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas
where base flood elevations have been determined
but a floodway has not been designated. This
means that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will not
increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one (1) foot at any point within
the City of Ripon; and
5. All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR’s)
for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building Permits
must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of
Map Revision (CLOMR’s). Approved CLOMR’s
allow construction of the proposed flood control
project and land preparation as specified in the
“start of construction” definition.
B. Development of Substantial Improvement
and Substantial Damage Procedures.
1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213,
“Answers to Questions About Substantially
Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures
for identifying and administering requirements for
substantial improvement and substantial damage,
to include defining “Market Value.”
2. Assure procedures are coordinated with
other departments/divisions and implemented by
community staff.
C. Review, Use and Development of Other
Base Flood Data.
When base flood elevation data has not been
provided in accordance with Section 8.01.031, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal or state
agency, or other source, in order to administer
these provisions.
NOTE: A base flood elevation shall be
obtained using one of two methods from the
FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing
Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A
Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing
Base (100-year) Flood Elevations” dated July
1995.D . Notification of Other Agencies.
1. Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
a. Notify adjacent communities and the
California Department of Water Resources prior to
alteration or relocation;
b. Submit evidence of such notification to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
c. Assure that the flood carrying capacity
within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse is maintained.
2. Base Flood Elevation changes due to
physical alterations:
a. Within 6 months of information becoming
available or project completion, whichever comes
first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or
assure that the permit applicant submits technical
or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR).
b. All LOMR’s for flood control projects are
approved prior t the issuance of building permits.
Building Permits must no be issued based on
Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR’s).
Approved CLOMR’s allow construction of the
proposed flood control project and land
preparation as specified in the “start of
construction” definition.
Such submissions are necessary so that upon
confirmation of those physical changes affecting
flooding conditions, risk premium rates and
floodplain management requirements are based on
current data.
3. Changes in corporate boundaries:
Notify FEMA in writing whenever the
corporate boundaries have been modified by
annexation or other means and include a copy of a
map of the community clearly delineating the new
120 - 8 11/16
8.01.041
corporate limits.
E. Documentation of Floodplain
Development.
Obtain and maintain for public inspection and
make available as needed the following:
1. Certification required by Section
08.01.050.C.1 and 8.01.053 (lowest floor
elevations);
2. Certification required by Section
8.01.050.C.2 (elevation or floodproofing of
nonresidential structures);
3. Certification required by Sections
8.01.050.C.3 (wet floodproofing standard);
4. Certification of elevation required by
Section 8.01.052.B (subdivision and other
proposed development standards);
5. Certification required by Section
8.01.055.A (floodway encroachments); and
6. Maintain a record of all variance actions
of the Ripon City Council, including justification
for their issuance, and report such variances issued
in its biennial report submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
F. Map Determinations.
Make interpretations where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the areas of
special flood hazard, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
field conditions. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in these provisions.
G. Remedial Action.
Take action to remedy violations of this
ordinance as specified in Section 8.01.032.
H. Biennial Report.
Complete and submit Biennial Report to
FEMA.
I. Planning.
Assure community’s General Plan is
consistent with floodplain management objectives
herein.
J. Non-conversion of enclosed areas below
the lowest floor.
To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall
be used solely for parking vehicles, limited
storage, or access to the building and not be
finished for use as human habitation without first
becoming fully compliant with the floodplain
management ordinance in effect at the time of
conversion, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
1. Determine which applicants for new
construction and/or substantial improvements have
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are
5 feet or higher;
2. Enter into a “NON-CONVERSION
AGREEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION WITHIN
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS” or equivalent with
the City of Ripon. The agreement shall be
recorded with the Office of the San Joaquin
County Recorder as a deed restriction. The
non-conversion agreement shall be in a form
acceptable to the Floodplain Administrator and
County Counsel; and
3. Have the authority to inspect any area of a
structure below the base flood elevation to ensure
compliance upon prior notice of at least 72 hours.
(Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.042 Development Permit.
A development permit shall be obtained
before any construction or other
development,including
manufactured homes, within any area of special
flood hazard established in Section 8.01.031.
Application for a development permit shall be
made on forms furnished by the City of Ripon.
The applicant shall provide the following
minimum information.
A. Plans in duplicate, drawn to scale,
showing:
1. Location, dimensions, and elevation of the

administration of this ordinance. (Ord. 726 §1,
2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.050 Standards of Construction
In all areas of special flood hazards the
following standards are required:
A. Anchoring.
All new construction and substantial
improvements of structures, including
manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement
of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
B. Construction materials and methods.
All new construction and substantial
improvement of structures, including
manufactured homes, shall be constructed:
1. With flood resistant materials, and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage for areas
below the base flood elevation;
2. Using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage;
3. With electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding; and
4. Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are
adequate drainage paths around structures on
slopes to guide flood waters around and away from
proposed structures.
C. Elevation and Floodproofing.

the FIRM [unnumbered A zone], elevated 2 feet
above the base flood elevation; as determined
under Section 8.01.041.C.
d. In a shaded X zone, elevated 2 feet above
the base flood elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure , the
elevation of the lowest floor, including basement,
shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, and verified by the
community building inspector to be properly
elevated. Such certification and verification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

or architect that the standards of section
8.01.050.C.2 are satisfied. Such certification shall
be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
3. Flood openings.
All new construction and substantial
improvements of structures with fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor (excluding
basements) that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement
must meet the following minimum criteria:
a. For non-engineered openings:
1. Have a minimum of two openings on
different sides having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
2. The bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one foot above grade;
3. Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices
provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwater; and
4. Buildings with more than one enclosed
area must have openings on exterior walls for each
area to allow flood water to directly enter; or
b. Be certified by a registered civil engineer
or architect.

parking (2 car detached garages or smaller) or
limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as defined
in Section 8.01.020, may be constructed such that
its floor is below the base flood elevation (BFE),
provided the structure is designed and constructed
in accordance with the following requirements:
a. Use of the accessory structure must be
limited to parking or limited storage;
b. The portions of the accessory structure
located below the BFE must be built using
flood-resistant materials;

standards in Section 8.01.050.
6. Crawlspace Construction.
This sub-section applies to buildings with
crawl spaces up to 2 feet below grade.
Below-grade crawl space construction in
accordance with the requirements listed below will
not be considered basements.
a. The building must be designed and
adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl space
construction is not allowed in areas with flood
velocities greater than 5 feet per second unless the
design is reviewed by a qualified design
professional, such as a registered architect or
professional engineer;
b. The crawl space is an enclosed area below the
BFE and, as such, must have openings that
equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For
120 - 11 11/16
8.01.050
guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technical
Bulletin 1-08;
c. Crawl space construction is not permitted
in V zones. Open pile or column foundations that
withstand storm surge and wave forces are
required in V zones;
d. Portions of the building below the BFE
must be constructed with materials resistant to
flood damage. This includes not only the
foundation walls of the crawl space used to elevate
the building, but also any joists, insulation, or
other materials that extend below the BFE; and
e. Any building utility systems within the
crawl space must be elevated above BFE or
designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or
accumulate within the system components during

space, measured from the interior grade of the
crawl space to the top of the crawl space
foundation wall must not exceed 4 feet (shown as
L in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01) at any
point.
3. There must be an adequate drainage
system that removes floodwaters from the interior
area of the crawl space within a reasonable period
of time after a flood event, not to exceed 72 hours;
and
4. The velocity of floodwaters at the site
should not exceed 5 feet per second for any crawl
space. For velocities in excess of 5 feet per
second, other foundation types should be used.
(Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.051 Standards for Utilities.
A. All new and replacement water supply

proposed development shall have public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems located and constructed to minimize
flood damage.
D. All subdivisions and other proposed
development shall provide adequate drainage to
reduce exposure to flood hazards. (Ord. 726 §1,
2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
120 - 12 11/16
8.01.053
8.01.053 Standards for Manufactured
Homes.
A. All manufactured homes that are placed or
substantially improved, on sites located: (1)
outside of a manufactured home park or
subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home
park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision;
or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision upon which a manufactured home has
incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a
flood, shall:
1. With Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated
2 feet above the base flood elevation and be
securely fastened to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
B. All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved on sites in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision within
Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to
the provisions of Section 8.01.053.A will be
securely fastened to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement, and be elevated so that either
the:
1. Lowest floor of the manufactured home is
at least 2 feet above the base flood elevation; or
2. Manufactured home chassis is supported
by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of
at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36
inches in height above grade.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation
of the lowest floor including basement shall be
certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed
land surveyor, and verified by the community
building inspector to be properly elevated. Such
certification and verification shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005;
Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.054 Standards for Recreational
Vehicles.
A. All recreational vehicles placed in Zones
A1-30, AH, and AE will either:
1. Be on the site for fewer than 180
consecutive days; or

attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions; or
3. Meet the permit requirements of Section
8.01.042 of this ordinance and the elevation and
anchoring requirements for manufactured homes
in Section 8.01.053.A. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord.
779 §1, 2010)
8.01.055 Floodways.
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential,
the following provisions apply:
A. Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no
new construction, substantial development, or
other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all
other development will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood ore than 1 foot
at any point within the City of Ripon.
B. Within an adopted regulatory floodway,
the City of Ripon shall prohibit encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, unless
certification by a registered civil engineer is
provided demonstrating that the proposed
encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
C. If Sections 8.01.055.A & B are satisfied,
all new construction, substantial improvement, and
other proposed new development shall comply
with all other applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of this ordinance. (Ord. 726 §1, 2005;
Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.060 Nature of Variances
The issuance of a variance is for flood plain
management purposes only. Insurance premium
rates are determined by statute according to
actuarial risk and will not be modified by the
granting of a variance.
120 - 13 11/16
8.01.060
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the
ordinance are based on the general principle of
zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature. A
variance may be granted for a parcel of property
with physical characteristics so unusual that
complying with the requirements of this ordinance
would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The
characteristics must be unique to the property and
not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to
the structure, its inhabitants, or the property
owners.
It is the duty of the Ripon City Council to help
protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so
compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so
serious that variances from the flood elevation or
from other requirements in the flood ordinance are
quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if
variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the
variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are
more detailed and contain multiple provisions that
must be met before a variance can be properly
granted. The criteria are designed to screen out
those situations in which alternatives other than a
variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 726 §1,
2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.061 Conditions for Variances.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new
construction, substantial improvement, and other
proposed new development to be erected on a lot
of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing
that the procedures in this ordinance have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in
Section 8.01.020 of this ordinance) upon a
determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any
mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a
determination by the Ripon City Council that the
City Council need not grant permission for the
applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever
elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that
elevation which the Ripon City Council believes
will both provide relief and preserve the integrity
of the local ordinance.
E. Any applicant to whom a variance is
granted shall be given written notice that:
1. The issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage, and
2. Such construction below the base flood
level increases risks to life and property. A copy
of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the San Joaquin
County Recorder and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.
F. The Floodplain Administrator will
maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in its biennial report submitted to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.(Ord.
779 §1, 2010)
8.01.062 Additional Variance Procedures
and Criteria.
A. In passing upon requests for variances, the
Ripon City Council shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this ordinance, and
the:
1. Danger that materials may be swept onto
other lands to the injury of others;
2. Danger of life and property due to
flooding or erosion damage;
3. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and
its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the existing individual owner and
future owners of the property;
4. Importance of the services provided by
the proposed facility to the community;
120 - 14 11/16
8.01.062
5. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront
location, where applicable;
6. Availability of alternative locations for
the proposed use which are not subject to flooding
or erosion damage;
7. Compatibility of the proposed use with
existing and anticipated development;
8. Relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
9. Safety of access to the property in time of
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
10. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate
of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters
expected at the site; and
11. Costs of providing governmental services
during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
system, and streets and bridges.
B. Variances shall only be issued by the City
Council upon a:
1. Showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. Determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional “hardship” to
the applicant; and
3. Determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public
safety and nuisance”), cause “fraud and
victimization” of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
C. Variances may be issued for new
construction, substantial improvement, and other
proposed new development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided
that the provisions of Sections 8.01.062.A through
8.01.062.D are satisfied and that the structure or
other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety
and does not create a public nuisance.
D. Upon consideration of the factors of
Section 8.01.062.A and the purposes of this
ordinance, the Ripon City Council may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
(Ord. 726 §1, 2005; Ord. 779 §1, 2010)
8.01.063 Development in Flood Hazard Zone
A. Development of land, including but not
limited to development agreement, tentative
subdivision maps, parcel maps, discretionary
approvals and ministerial approvals for residential
units, shall not be approved until any applicable
findings required in Chapter 16.10: 200-year flood
protection have been made.

Section 8.05.010. Findings and purpose.
A. The city council finds that numerous studies
have found that tobacco smoke is a major
contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing
secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard for
certain population groups, including elderly people,
individuals with cardiovascular disease, and
individuals with impaired respiratory functions,
including asthmatics and those with obstructive
airway disease.
B. That as a result, certain health hazards are
induced by breathing secondhand smoke, including
lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise
tolerance, decreased respiratory function and
bronchial spasms.
C. That certain nonsmokers also suffer allergies
and other respiratory diseases and ill effects from
breathing secondhand smoke, causing a loss of job
productivity and that smoking is a documented cause
of fires.
D. Accordingly, the City Council finds and
declare that the purpose of this chapter is to protect
the public health, safety and welfare by prohibiting
smoking in certain public premises except in such
designated smoking areas as may be hereafter
established by the City Council pursuant to this
chapter, (Ord 453 § 1 (part), 1990)

8.12.180
For the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the City, the ninety (90) gallon
containers must not be overloaded so that the
lids will not close. If more volume is needed,
a second ninety (90) gallon container must be

lid is not able to be closed, the garbage and
refuse producer may be cited by the City, and
the garbage and refuse producer charged a
surcharge equal to one-half ( ½ ) the normal
monthly rate for each violation of residential
customers.
For commercial and industrial containers
where commercial or industrial users overload
any container, the City may cite the garbage
and refuse producer, and for those commercial
and industrial solid wastes which are collected

( ½ ) the normal monthly rate for each

C. Rate Reduction. A solid waste
collection fee "poverty level" exemption is
waste generators having a household income
below the "very low income" limits then in
effect at the time of any request for such an
exemption, which limits are periodically
established in San Joaquin County by the
United States Department of Housing and
Community Development for use in
connection with Division 31, Housing and
Home Finance, Section 500, et seq, of the
Health and Safety Code of the State of
California. Such "poverty level" exemption is
also established in those factual situations
where special conditions warrant the giving of
such an exemption by reason of a particular
financial hardship or inequity or which may
be judged by City to contribute to the general
community good or betterment of the City and
its citizens. Satisfactory proof of such a
"poverty level" income or special
circumstances, where applicable, shall be
presented to the City Administrator or his
representative who may then approve such an
exemption. If a poverty level exemption is
granted, the refuse customer shall be entitled
to a Thirty-three Percent (33%) per month
reduction in the residential garbage and refuse
customer rate to be paid by such a garbage
and refuse user qualifying for the residential
"poverty level" exemption. Such a reduction
in the fee shall continue until such time as the
fee rate is modified or discontinued by action
of the City Administrator by reason of a

8.14.010 Findings and purpose.
The City Council finds as follows:
A. Illegal dumping activities pose a danger
to public health and safety, decrease property
values, lower the quality of life, contribute to
blight, and attract more illegal dumping.
B. Materials that are illegally dumped
create a nesting area for rodents, insects, and
other vermin while impacting the proper
drainage of runoff, and making areas more
susceptible to flooding when draining basins
become clogged.
C. Illegal dumping activities also place an
undue burden on the City of Ripon, for cleanup,
public education, and enforcement costs.
D. Illegal dumping is facilitated by the use
of vehicles, whereby persons utilize vehicles to
transport waste matter for the purpose of
illegally dumping the waste matter.
E. The procedures for seizing and
impounding vehicles used to illegally dump
waste matter are expressly intended as a remedy
to abate these public nuisances and to protect the
City’s residents and the public from harm to
their health, safety, and welfare. Examples of
such damages are the costs of cleaning up illegal
dumpsites and diverting limited public resources
to address the nuisance activities through direct
enforcement and other programs designed to
prevent illegal dumping. Any deterrent effect is
deemed incidental to the remedial purpose of
this chapter. (Ord. 865, 2017)

8.20.010 Legislative findings and declarations.
The City Council finds and declares that the
increase of graffiti on public and private buildings,
structures, play grounds, buses, signs, and in other
places, creates a condition of blight within the City,
which can result in the deterioration of property
values, business opportunities, and enjoyment of life
for persons using adjacent and surrounding property
all to the detriment of the City. The City Council
finds that graffiti is often used as a method of
communication or marking territory between
juvenile gangs and that the presence of juvenile
gangs in the City is not favored. The City Council
further finds that graffiti is inconsistent with the
City’s property maintenance goals, crime prevention
programs, and aesthetic standards. It is a public
nuisance which serves as an invitation for repeated
trespasses and vandalism and therefore must be
abated to avoid the detrimental impact of such
graffiti on the City and to prevent the further spread
of graffiti.
The City Council’s intent in adopting this
chapter is to provide regulations designed to prevent
and control the application of graffiti on property
within the City and to provide a program for removal
of graffiti from walls and structures on both public
and private property. (Ord. 592 §1, 1999)

City, the Chief of Police or his/her designee may
cause a written notice to be served upon the owner
of the affected premises as such owner’s name and

A. The City Council finds that
an ordinance is necessary to regulate the
Cultivation of Marijuana or Cannabis in
a manner that protects the health, safety
and welfare of the community consistent
with Proposition 64, also known as the
Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of
Marijuana Act (“AUMA”). This
Chapter is not intended to interfere with
a patient’s right to medical Marijuana or
Cannabis, as provided for in California
Health & Safety Code Section 11362.5,
nor does it criminalize medical
Marijuana or Cannabis possession or
cultivation by specifically defined
classifications of persons, pursuant to
state law. This Chapter is not intended
to give any person unfettered legal
authority to grow Marijuana or
Cannabis; it is intended to impose
zoning restrictions on the personal
indoor Cultivation of Marijuana or
Cannabis permitted under AUMA when
it is authorized by California state law
for medical or other lawful purposes.
B. No part of this Chapter shall
be deemed to conflict with federal law as
contained in the Controlled Substances

8.28.010 PURPOSE AND INTENT
A. In enacting this Chapter, the City
Council recognizes that commercial massage
therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer
the public valuable health and therapeutic
services. The City Council further recognizes
that, unless properly regulated, the practice of
massage therapy and the operation of massage
businesses may be associated with unlawful
activity and may pose a threat to the quality of
life in the local community. Accordingly, it is
the purpose and intent of this Chapter to protect
the public health, safety and welfare by
providing for the orderly regulation of
businesses providing massage therapy services,
discouraging prostitution and related illegal
activities carried on under the guise of massage
therapy, and establishing certain sanitation,
health and operational standards for massage
businesses.
B. Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent
of this Chapter to address the negative impacts
identified in the City Council’s findings to
reduce or prevent neighborhood blight and to
protect and preserve the quality of the City, and
to enhance enforcement of laws and regulations
relating to the conduct of operators and
employees of massage businesses.
C. It is the Council’s further purpose and
intent to rely upon the uniform statewide
regulations applicable to massage practitioners
and establishments that were enacted by the
State Legislature as Business and Professions
Code sections 4600 et seq., as currently drafted
or as may be amended, to restrict the
commercial practice of massage in the City to
those persons duly certified to practice by the
California Massage Therapy Council, and to
provide for the registration and regulation of
massage businesses for health and safety
purposes to the extent allowed by law. (Ord.

this higher degree of governmental regulation is
necessary due to the particular vulnerability of
minors and their inability to make critical

governmental interest in preserving the safety of
the community and providing a higher degree of

10.48.010 Findings and Declarations
In addition to and in accordance with the
determination made and the authority granted by the
State of California under section 22660 of the
Vehicle Code of the State to remove abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts
thereof as public nuisances, the City Council makes
the following findings and declarations:
The accumulation and storage of abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts
thereof on private or public property, not including
highways, is found to create a condition tending to
reduce the value of the property, to promote blight
and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire
hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance
creating a hazard to health and safety of minors, to
create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be
injurious to the health, safety and general welfare.
In addition, the outdoor storage of an excessive
number of vehicles by automobile repair shops also
contributes to the aforementioned adverse impacts.
Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled, or inoperative vehicle or part thereof,
on private or public property not including
highways, except as expressly hereinafter
permitted, and the outdoor storage of an excessive
number of vehicles by automobile repair shops is
declared to constitute a public nuisance which may
be abated as such in accordance with the provisions
of this Chapter. The storage of excessive numbers
of vehicles by automobile repair shops shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 10.48.160
and 10.48.170(d) of this Chapter. (Ord. 653 §1,
2002)

10.58.010 Legislative purpose.
This chapter is enacted in response to the
serious adverse effects caused in certain areas and
neighborhoods of the city by motor vehicle
congestion, particularly the long-term parking of
motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and
neighborhoods by nonresidents who do not visit or
conduct business with residents. As set forth in
more specific detail in Section 10.58.020 of this
chapter, such parking by nonresidents threatens
the health, safety and welfare of all the residents
of the City of Ripon. In order to protect these
areas and neighborhoods, it is necessary to enact
parking regulations restricting parking by
nonresidents, while providing the opportunity for
residents to park near their homes. In these
situations, uniform parking regulations restricting
residents and nonresidents alike would not serve
the public interest. Rather such regulations
would contribute to neighborhood decline while
ignoring alternatives to automobile travel
available to nonresidents who park in these areas.
For the reasons set forth in this chapter and
pursuant to the authority of Vehicle Code Section
22507, a system of preferential resident parking
is enacted for the City of Ripon. (Ord. 832, 2016)
10.58.020 Legislative findings
A. General Findings. The City Council finds
that serious adverse effects in certain areas and
neighborhoods of the City of Ripon result from
motor vehicle congestion, and in neighborhoods
by nonresidents who do not visit or conduct
business with residents. The permit program
established by this chapter will relieve these
serious adverse affects by:
1. Reducing potential hazardous traffic
conditions;
2. Protecting such areas and
neighborhoods from polluted air, excessive
noise, trash and refuse caused by the entry and
exit of such motor vehicles;
3. Protecting the residents of such areas
and neighborhoods from unreasonable burdens in
obtaining parking near their residences and in
gaining access to their residence;
4. Preserving the character of such areas
and neighborhoods as residential; promoting the
efficiency of the maintenance of
182-6 (Ripon 3/16)
10.58.040
the streets of such areas and neighborhoods in a
clean and safe condition;
5. Preserving the value of property in
such areas and neighborhoods;
6. Preserving the safety of children and
other pedestrians;
7. Promoting traffic safety and the
peace, good order, comfort, convenience and
general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of
Ripon.
B. Specific Findings. The following specific
legislative findings of the City Council in support
of preferential resident parking are set forth as
illustrations of the need compelling the
enactment of this chapter. These findings do not
exhaust the subject of the factual basis
supporting the enactment of this preferential
resident parking program.
1. The safety, health, and welfare of the
residents of the City of Ripon can be greatly
enhanced by maintenance of the attractiveness
and livability of its neighborhoods and other
residential areas;
2. Certain neighborhoods and areas of
the City of Ripn have marginally sufficient or
insufficient on- or off-street space to
accommodate the convenient parking of motor
vehicles by residents in the vicinity of their
homes;
3. Some neighborhoods and areas as
described in subsection (B)(3) of this section are
often burdened by the parking in such
neighborhoods and areas of motor vehicles
owned by nonresidents which compete for the
available on-street parking spaces;
4. There exists certain parking
“generators” within the City of Ripon, i.e.,
regional recreation areas, and schools, which
attract nonresidents to residential areas to seek
parking which increases the severity of the
shortage of space for resident parking in such
neighborhoods and residential areas;
5. Unnecessary vehicle miles, noise,
pollution, and strain on interpersonal relationships
caused by the conditions set forth herein create
unacceptable hardships on residents of these
neighborhoods and areas by causing the
deterioration of air quality, safety, tranquility, and
other values of the urban residential environment;
6. If allowed to continue, these adverse
effects on the residents of the City of Ripon will
contribute to a decline of the living conditions
therein, a reduction in the attractiveness of
residing within the City, and consequent injury to
the general public welfare; and, enacted in this
chapter will serve to promote the safety, health
and welfare of all the residents of the City by
reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle
travel, noise and pollution, and by promoting
improvement in air quality, the convenience and
attractiveness of urban residential living, and the
increased use of public mass transit facilities
available now and in the future. The public
welfare will also be served by preserving a more
stable and valuable property tax base in order to
generate the revenues required to provide
essential public services. (Ord. 832, 2016)

10.58.050 Designation and annexation
criteria.
In determining whether a residential area
may be recommended to the City Council as a
residential permit parking area or annexed into an
existing residential permit parking area, the
Parking Manager shall take into account factors
which include, but are not limited to:
A. The desire and need of the residents for
residential permit parking; and

the residential area during the period proposed for
parking regulations. (Ord. 832, 2016)
10.58.060 Designation/annexation
process.
A. Persons desiring the designation of a
residential permit parking area or annexation of
an area to an existing residential permit parking
area shall consult with the Parking Manager to
tentatively establish the boundaries of the area
proposed for designation or annexation.
B. If the Parking Manager determines there is a
significant show of interest by the residents in the
residential area proposed for designation or
annexation, the Parking Manager shall undertake
a parking study to determine the appropriate
residential permit parking regulations for the
area.
C. The parking study occupancy rates shall
determine the parking restrictions as follows:
occupancy rates of eight-five (85) percent or
more shall support a parking limitation of one
hour or less; occupancy rates of more than fifty
(50) percent but less than eighty-five (85) percent
shall support a parking limitation of more than
one hour; and occupancy rates of fifty (50)
percent or less, shall result in no change to the
current parking restrictions. In addition, if
occupancy rates are fifty (50) percent or less the
Parking Manager shall decline a request to
designate or annex the same residential area or a
substantial portion of that area, for a period of
one year following determination of the
occupancy rate unless there is a substantial
change in the character of the residential area that
impacts the need and desire for residential permit
parking.
D. If the parking study shows more than a fifty
(50) percent occupancy rate, the Parking Manager
shall undertake voting surveys of the owners of
the properties located on the
182-8 (Ripon 3/16)
10.58.070
blockface(s) for the areas proposed for
designation or annexation to determine support or

returned surveys showing support for the
designation or annexation, the area shall not be
designated or annexed as a residential permit
parking area.
E. After determining that a majority of the voting
surveys are returned with at least two-thirds of
the returned surveys showing support for the
proposed designation or annexation of the area as
a residential permit parking area, the Parking
Manager shall recommend to the City Council to
designate or annex the area as a residential permit
parking area. Following the City Council
approval, the Parking Manager shall mail notices
to the residents of the proposed new or annexed
residential permit parking area setting forth the
proposed location and boundaries of the area, the
proposed residential permit parking regulations,
and the fees, if any, to be charged upon permit

E. If the parking study occupancy rate is more
than fifty (50) percent, the Parking Manager shall
mail out notices to the residents of the area
proposed for modification. The notices shall set
forth the parking regulation modifications and the

12.28.010 Legislative Findings and
Statement of Purpose.
The streets, public areas, and private areas
within the City of Ripon, and along the
Stanislaus River, need to be readily
accessible and available to residents and the
public at large. The use of these areas for
camping, sleeping or living in vehicles, and
for the storage of personal property,
interferes with the rights of others to use
these areas for which they were intended.
Such activities can also constitute a public
health and safety hazard, which adversely
impacts other members of the public,
neighborhoods and commercial areas. The
purpose of this Chapter is to maintain public
and private lands, streets, sidewalks, alleys,
ways, creeks, waterways, parks,
playgrounds, recreation areas, plazas, open
spaces, lots, parcels and other public and
private areas within the City, in a clean,
sanitary and accessible condition. Further,
the purpose of this Chapter is to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the community,
while recognizing that subject to reasonable
conditions, camping associated with special
events can be beneficial to the cultural and
educational wellbeing of City residents.
Nothing in this Chapter is intended to
interfere with otherwise lawful and ordinary
uses of public or private property.
Camping on private property without the
consent of the owner, proper sanitary
measures and for other than a minimal
duration adversely affects private property
rights as well as public health, safety, and
welfare of the City.
The unauthorized or inappropriate use of
outdoor cooking equipment, open flame,
fires or stoves of any sort typically
associated with camping creates a major fire
threat to life, safety and property, including
public and private property, open lands, and
hillsides. Illegal campsites are typically
located in areas where high levels of
combustible vegetation are located (e.g.,
wooded areas), which creates an even higher
level of a fire threat.
Further, camping adjacent to, within, or
below the top of banks of any river, canal or
stream poses a health and safety risk from
potential flooding, proximity to unstable
banks with slippage potential, health risks
from human waste entering into rivers,
streams or other waterways and the risk of
damage to environmentally sensitive habitat
and species known to exist in some portions
of the City, such as rivers, streams,
waterways, and wetlands.

13.05.080 Implementation program.
13.05.010 Findings purpose and intent.
The council of the city finds that:
A. The people of the state of California
and the city of Ripon have a primary interest
in the development of facilities to utilize
nonpotable water in order to supplement the
existing surface and underground water
supplies and to assist in meeting the future
water requirements of the city and state and to
conserve potable water supplies.
B. The conservation of all available water
resources includes and requires the maximum
use of nonpotable water, including surface
water, for beneficial uses of water.
C. The continued use of potable water for
the irrigation of greenbelt areas and for other
uses such as decorative ponds and lagoons,
watering outdoor plantings, gardens and lawns
in the city where the use of nonpotable water
is suitable may be an unreasonable use of such
water where non- potable water, including
surface water, is available.

are in the best interest of the city. This chapter
is necessary to protect the common water
supply of the city which is vital to the city's
residents' public health, safety and well-being,
and to prevent endangerment of public and

available nonpotable water, including surface
water where available, the need for additional
imported water can be reduced and the present
potable water supply can be conserved. In
light of all these circumstances, certain uses of

(part), 1991)
13.05.070 Mandatory nonpotable water
use.
A. General. No person or public agency,
as used in California Water Code Section
13551, shall use water from any source or of
quality suitable for potable domestic use for
the irrigation of greenbelt areas, lawns,
gardens, or other uses where the use of
nonpotable water is suitable, and when
nonpotable water, including surface water, is
available and its use is required and
authorized by city.
B. Identification of Users. Persons or
agencies who are mandated to use nonpotable
water are to be identified and
permitted as described in this section.
C. Existing Potable Water Service.
1. Preliminary Determination. Upon the
designation of each nonpotable water service
area or the commencement of the design of
nonpotable water facilities, the city shall make
preliminary determinations as to which
existing potable water customers shall be
converted to the use of or required to use
nonpotable water. Each such water customer
shall be notified of the basis for such a
determination that the use of non- potable
water service will be required, as well as the
proposed conditions and schedule for use.
2. Notice. The notice of such a
preliminary determination, including the
proposed conditions and time schedule for
compliance, and a nonpotable water permit
application shall be sent to the water customer
by certified mail.
3. Objections. The water customer may
file an objection with the city administrator
within thirty days after any notice of
determination to comply is delivered or
mailed to the customer, and may request
reconsideration of the determination or
modification of the proposed conditions or
schedule for conversion or use. The objection
must be in writing and specify the reasons for
the objection. The preliminary determination
shall be final if the customer does not file a
timely objection. The city administrator shall
appoint a panel of three staff members,
including the city engineer, who shall review
the objection and shall confirm modify or
abandon the preliminary determination. The
panel shall make a final determination within
thirty days of the filing of the notice of
objection.
D. Developments, Annexations, and
Water Service Approvals.
Nonpotable Water Distribution System 213 - 5 (1/04)
13.05.070
1. The owner or developer of any
proposed annexation to city where any new
development is contemplated, whether
residential, commercial or industrial, shall
cause to have designed, constructed and
installed at owner's or developer's expense a
nonpotable water system, if required by the
city. The actual system and its design and the
line sizes required shall be first approved by
city before their installation.
For all areas within proposed annexations
to the city, including commercial, industrial or
residential developments, or any other type of
development utilizing water for the irrigation
of yards, parks, lawns, other landscaped areas,
or ponds and lagoons or lakes, shall have
designed and constructed non- potable
distribution mains to serve all areas within the
proposed development. If non- potable supply
or surface water lines are within one thousand
feet of the proposed new development, a
service line shall be extended and connected
to the nonpotable line by owner or developer
at no cost to city, if requested by city.
For good cause and with the approval of
the city council upon a proper application
therefor, a new annexation and-development
may, however, be allowed to utilize water
solely from the potable system of the city for
irrigation purposes, rather than being required
to use nonpotable water. In the event that such
an exemption is granted by the city council,
water meter installations may be required,
however, by city or by action of the state of
California to conserve the use of potable
water.
2. Conditions. Upon application by a
developer, owner or water customer (herein
referred to as "applicant") for a tentative map,
subdivision map, land use permit, or any other
development project as defined by
Government Code Section 65928, the city
administrator shall review the master plan and
make a preliminary determination whether the
current or proposed use of the subject
property requires it to be served with
nonpotable water, including surface water, or
to include facilities designed to accommodate
the use of nonpotable water in the future due
to its location within an existing or proposed
nonpotable water service area. Based upon
such determination, a permit for such use may
be required as a condition of approval of any
such application, in addition to any other
conditions of approval or service if the city so
determines.
3. Single-family Home Developments.
All single-family home developments and
subdivisions constructed after the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter
shall provide for and include a nonpotable
water distribution system, including any
necessary mains and lines and shall connect to
the nonpotable water system of city where
nonpotable water, including surface water, is
available and if the city, requires such a
connection.
4. Alterations and Remodeling. On a case
by case basis, upon application for a permit
for the alteration or remodeling of a
single-family, multifamily, commercial or,
industrial structure, the city administrator
shall review the master plan and make a
preliminary determination whether the subject
property is within a nonpotable water service
area (existing or proposed) and should be
served with nonpotable water, or include
facilities designed to accommodate the use of
nonpotable water, including surface water, in
the future. Based upon such determination
that use of nonpotable water and provision of
nonpotable water distribution systems or other
Nonpotable Water Distribution System 213 - 6 (1/04)
13.05.070
facilities for the use of nonpotable water,
including surface water, is appropriate, a
permit for such use may, be required as a
condition of approval of the application.
5. Voluntary Requested Service. On a
case by case basis, upon a voluntary
application for a permit to use nonpotable
water on a property not covered by
subsections D (1-4) of this section, the city
administrator shall review the master plan and
make a determination whether the subject
property should be served with nonpotable
water, including surface water, and that such
service is available. Based upon such
determination, the application for the permit
shall be accepted and processed subject to
subsection C of this section.
6. Notice of Determination. A notice of
the basis for the preliminary determination,
proposed conditions of approval and schedule
for compliance shall be provided to the
applicant prior to approval of the development
application or application for water service.
E. Nonpotable Water Permit Process.
Upon a final determination by the city that a
property shall be served with nonpotable
water or upon the adoption of a condition of
annexation, development approval or water
service requiring the use or accommodation of
the use of nonpotable water, the water
customer, owner or applicant shall obtain a
nonpotable water permit.
1. Permit Conditions. The permit shall
specify the design and operational
requirements for the applicant's water
distribution facilities and schedule for
compliance, based on such rules and
regulations adopted by city pursuant to
Section 13.05.040.
2. Plan Approval. Plans for the
nonpotable water distribution systems for the
parcel or any development or building or
construction shall be reviewed by the city and
a field inspection conducted before the permit
is granted.
3. Permit Issuance. Upon approval of
plans the permit shall be issued. Nonpotable
water shall not be supplied to a property until
inspection by the city determines that the
applicant is in compliance with the permit
conditions and that no cross- connections and
contamination of the potable water supply
exists.
F. Temporary Use of Potable Water. At
the discretion of the city, potable water may
be made available on a temporary basis to any
property, until nonpotable water is available.
Before the applicant receives temporary
potable water, a nonpotable water permit, as
described in Section 13.05.070 (C), must be
obtained for new on-site distribution facilities.
G. Prior to commencement of nonpotable
water service, an inspection of the
on-site facilities will be conducted to verify
that the facilities have been maintained and
are in compliance with the nonpotable water
permit and current requirements for service.
Upon verification of compliance, nonpotable
water shall be served to the parcel for the
intended use. If the facilities are not in
compliance, the applicant shall be notified of
the corrective actions necessary and shall have
at least thirty days to take such actions prior to
initiation of enforcement proceedings.
H. No person shall perform any work on
the nonpotable water system of city without
first obtaining the written consent of the city.
In addition, no person shall tamper with, alter,
damage, cut into, or make a connection with
the nonpotable water system of city. Further,
no on-site cross- connections shall be
permitted between the potable and nonpotable
Nonpotable Water Distribution System 213 - 7 (1/04)
13.05.070
water systems and each system shall have
independent and separate distribution lines,
mains and valves. Each separate system shall
have a different colored taping or pipe
coloring as designated by city to make
identification readily possible. No outside
hose bibs shall be permitted on any system
lines other than for potable water in order to
avoid the possibility of the consumption of
nonpotable water.
I. Nonpotable Water Rate. The rates to
be charged for nonpotable water shall be
established by resolution of the City. The city
shall also have the right to require the
installation of a water meter on any
non-potable or potable service if deemed
necessary by the city. (Ord. 481 § 1 (part),
1991)
13.05.080 Implementation program.
A. Rules and Regulations. The city
administrator and the city engineer shall
establish general rules and regulations
governing the use and distribution of
nonpotable water.
B. Public Awareness Program. The city
administrator shall also establish a
comprehensive nonpotable water public
awareness program.
C. Financing Programs. The city
administrator may, through the master plan, or
other program, identify resources and adopt
measures to assist water users in the financing
of necessary conversions mandated by this
chapter. (Ord. 481 § 1 (part), 1991)

The Ordinance codified in this Chapter shall
be known as the Water Efficient Landscape
Ordinance. (Ord. 508 § 1 (part), 1992)
13.06.020 Purpose.
A. The City of Ripon City Council hereby
finds as follows:
1. That the present limited water supply is
subject to ever-increasing demands;
2. That the City's economic prosperity
depends on continued adequate supplies of water;
3. That City policy promotes conservation
and efficient use of water;
4. That landscaping provide recreation areas,
clean the air and water, prevent erosion, offer fire
protection, and replace ecosystems; and
5. That landscape design, installation, and
maintenance should be water efficient.
B. Consistent with these findings, the
purpose of this ordinance is to:
1. Promote the values and benefits of
landscapes recognizing the need to utilize water
and other resources as efficiently as possible;
2. Establish a structure for designing,
installing, and maintaining water efficient
landscapes in new projects; and
3. Establish provisions for water
management practices and water waste prevention
for established landscapes. (Ord 508 § 1 (part),
1992)
13.06.030 Definitions.
The words used in this ordinance have the
meaning as set forth below:
A. "Anti-drain valve" or "check valve" means
a valve located under a sprinkler head to hold
water in the system so it minimizes drainage from
the lower elevation sprinkler heads.
B. "Application rate" means the depth of
water applied to a given area, usually measured in
inches per hour.
C. "Automatic controller" means a
mechanical or solid state timer, capable of
operating valve stations to set the days and length
of time of a water application.
D. "Backflow prevention device" means a
safety device used to prevent pollution or
contamination of the water supply due to the
reverse flow of water from the irrigation system.
E. "Conversion factors" means to convert the
amount of water applied in inches per acre to
gallons per square foot divided by 0.62, to convert
cubic foot of water to gallons per cubic foot
multiply by 7.48.
F. "Emitter" means irrigation fittings that
deliver water slowly from the system to the soil.
G. "Established landscape" means that roots
from seedlings or potted plants have extended into
the surrounding soil.
H. "Establishment period" means the first
year after installing the plan in the landscape.
I. "ET adjustment factor" means a factor
applied to reference evapotranspiration that makes
adjustments for plant factors and irrigation
efficiency.
For example, in a combined plant mix with a
site-wide average of 0.5, and an irrigation
efficiency of 0.625, the Adjustment Factor would
be 0.5 divided by .625 or .8.
J. "Evapotranspiration" means the quantity
of water evaporated from adjacent soil surfaces
and transpired by plants during a specific time.
K. "Flow rate" means the rate at which water
flows through pipes and valves (gallons per
minute or cubic feet per second).
L. "Hydrozone" means a portion of the
landscaped area having plants with similar water
needs that are served by a valve or set of valves
with the same schedule. A hydrozone my be
Water Efficient Landscape 213 - 9 (Ripon 3-93)
13.06.030
irrigated or non-irrigated. For example, a
naturalized area planted with native vegetation
that will not need supplemental irrigation once
established is a non-irrigated hydrozone.
M. "Infiltration rate" means the rate of water
entry into the soil expressed as a depth of water
per unit of time.
N. "Irrigation efficiency" means the
measurement of the amount of water beneficially
used, divided by the amount of water applied.
Irrigation efficiency is derived from measurements
and estimates of irrigation system characteristics
and management practices. The minimum
irrigation efficiency for purposes of this ordinance
is 0.625. Greater irrigation efficiency can be
expected from well designed and maintained
systems.
O. "Landscape irrigation audit" means a
process to perform site inspections, evaluate
irrigation systems, and develop efficient irrigation
schedules.
P. "Landscaped area" means the entire parcel
less the building footprint, driveways, nonirrigated
portions of parking lots, hardscapes--such
as decks and patios, and other non-porous areas.
Water features are included in the calculation of
the landscaped area.
Q. "Lateral line" means the water delivery
pipeline that supplies water to the emitters or
sprinklers from the valve.
R. "Main line" means the pressurized
pipeline that delivers water from the water source
to the valve or outlet.
S. "Maximum Water Allowance" means, for
design purposes, the upper limit of annual water
use for the established landscaped area based upon
the area's reference evapotranspiration, the ET
Adjustment Factor, and the size of the landscaped
area.
T. "Mulch" means any material such as
leaves, bark, straw or other materials left loose and
applied to the soil surface to reduce evaporation.
U. "Operating pressure" means the pressure
at which a system of sprinklers is designed to
operate, usually indicated at the base of a
sprinkler.
V. "Overspray" means the water which is
delivered beyond the landscaped area, wetting
pavements, walks, structures, or other nonlandscaped
areas.
W. "Plant factor" means a factor that when
multiplied by reference evapotranspiration,
estimates the amount of water used by plants. For
purposes of this ordinance, the average plant
factor of low water using plants ranges from 0 to
0.3, for average water using plants the range is 0.4
to 0.6, and for high water using plants the range is
0.7 to 1.0.
X. "Rain sensing device" means a system
which automatically shuts off the irrigation system
when it detects rainfall.
Y. "Record drawing" or "as-builts" means a
set of reproducible drawings including significant
changes in the work made during construction.
Z. "Nonpotable water" means it does not
meet potable standards, but is satisfactory for
landscape irrigation. It may include water that
does not meet drinking water standards or treated
recyclable sewage water.
AA. "Reference evapotranspiration" or
"ETo" means a standard measurement of
environmental parameters which affect the water
use of plants.
BB. "Run off" means water which is not
absorbed by the soil or landscape to which it is
applied and flows from the area. For example, run
off may result from water that is applied at too
great a rate (application rate exceeds infiltration
rate) or when the topography is severely sloped.
CC. "Soil moisture sensing device" means a
device that measures the amount of water in the
soil.
DD. "Soil texture" means the classification
of a soil based on the percentage of sand, silt, and
clay in the soil.
EE. "Sprinkler head" means a device which
sprays water through a nozzle.

of precipitation that contributes to the water needs
Water Efficient Landscape 213 - 10 (Ripon 3-93)
13.06.030
of the plants. Irrigation scheduling should be
adjusted to reflect usable precipitation. However,
for purposes of calculating the maximum water
allowance and estimating water use, usable
precipitation is not to be included as a factor.
JJ. "Valve" means a device used to control
the flow of water in the irrigation system.
KK. "Water conservation concept
statement" means a one-page checklist and a
narrative summary of the project as shown in

designing irrigation systems. All irrigation
systems shall be designed to avoid runoff, low
head drainage, overspray, or other similar
conditions where water flows onto adjacent
property, non-irrigated areas, walks, roadways, or
structures. Proper irrigation equipment and
schedules, including features such as repeat
cycles, shall be used to closely match application
rates to infiltration rates, therefore minimizing
runoff.
Special attention shall be given to avoid runoff
on slopes and to avoid overspray in planting areas
with a width less than ten feet, and in median
strips.
(ii) Equipment.
Water meters. Separate landscape water
meters shall be required for projects other than
single family homes or any project with a
landscaped area of less than 5,000 square feet.
Controllers. Automatic control systems shall
be required for all irrigation systems and must be
able to accommodate all aspects of the design as
well as multiple water cycles.
Valves. For plant groups which require
different water regimes or amounts of water,
separate valves are required. Anti-drain (check)
valves shall be installed at strategic points to
minimize or prevent low-head drainage.
Sprinkler heads. Heads and emitters shall be
selected for proper area coverage, application rate,
operating pressure, adjustment capability, and ease
of maintenance.
Rain sensing devices. Rain sensing devices
are required on all irrigation systems.
Soil moisture sensing devices. Soil moisture
sensing devices are encouraged.
b) Nonpotable Water.
(i) A dual water system shall be installed to
permit use of water that does not meet drinking
water standards and future use of recycled water,
unless a written exemption is granted by the City.
(ii) Irrigation systems shall make use of
nonpotable water unless a written exemption has
been granted by the City of Ripon stating that
recycled water is not available and will not be
available in the foreseeable future.
c) Irrigation design plan specifications.
The irrigation design plan shall be drawn on
project base sheets. It should be separate from,
but use the same format as, the landscape design
plan. The scale shall be the same as that used for
the landscape design plan described in Section
13.06.040 C.(3).
The irrigation design plan shall accurately and
clearly identify:
(i) Location and size of separate water meters
for the landscape, where required.
(ii) Location, type and size of all components
of the irrigation system, including automatic
controllers, main and lateral lines, valves,
sprinkler heads, soil moisture sensing devices, rain
switches, quick couplers, and backflow prevention
devices.
(iii) Static water pressure at the point of
connection to the public water supply.
Water Efficient Landscape 213 - 12 (Ripon 3-93)
13.06.040
(iv) Flow rate in gallons-per-minute,
application rate in inches-per-hour, and design
operating pressure in pounds-per-square-inch for
each station.
(v) Nonpotable irrigation systems as
specified in Section 13.06.040 C.(4) b).
(5) Irrigation schedules.
a) Projected irrigation schedules to satisfy
the conditions submitted as part of the landscape
documentation package.
The estimated water use recommended for the
established landscape shall not exceed the project's
maximum water allowance.
b) An annual irrigation program with
monthly irrigation schedules shall be required for
the plant establishment period, for the established
landscape, and for any temporarily irrigated areas.
The irrigation schedule may include usable
precipitation as a factor, however, the estimated
water use calculation shall not include usable
precipitation.
c) The total amount of water for the project
shall include water designated in the annual
irrigation schedule, plus water needed for any
water features, which shall be considered as a high
water using hydrozone.
d) Recreational areas designated in the
landscaped design plan shall be highlighted and
the irrigation schedule shall indicate if any
additional water is needed above the maximum
water allowance because of high plant factors (but
not due to irrigation inefficiency).
e) Whenever possible, irrigation
scheduling shall incorporate the use of
evapotranspiration data such as those from the
California Irrigation Management System
(CIMIS) weather stations.

Service Charges
The monthly sewer service charge for

limits shall, wherever practicable, be based upon
flow. The City Engineer may require commercial
and industrial users to install flow meter
equipment to accurately determine flows.
Monthly sewer service charges shall be
determined as follows:
A. Flat Rate Method. For commercial and
industrial users discharging commercial and
industrial waste to the sewer system of the City,
a Minimum Base Rate of $16.11 shall be
charged. For users without flow meters, there
shall be charged an additional amount of $7.91
for electrical costs of aeration, and $25.55 for
rehabilitation of the facility to meet current
effluent standards. Thus, the total Flat Rate
Charge for commercial and industrial users
without flow meters shall be $49.57. The
Minimum Base Rate and the Flat Rate Charge
shall automatically be adjusted annually based
upon the increase or decrease in the Bay Area
CPI Index.
B. Flow Charge Method. For commercial
and industrial users with flow meters discharging
commercial and industrial waste to the sewer
system of the City, a Minimum Base Rate of
$12.77 shall be charged. In addition, Flow

3. A Flow Charge for Suspended Solids
(“SS”) of $120.00 per 1,000 lbs.
The monthly sewer service charge shall be the
total of the Minimum Base Rate and all Flow
Sewer System Rates & Charges 220 6/06
13.12.020
Charges. The Minimum Base Rate and the Flow
Charges shall automatically be adjusted annually
based upon the increase or decrease in the
Engineer’s News Record Index.
C. Alternative Methods.
1. As an alternative to the installation of flow
meters, existing commercial and industrial users
which do not presently have flow meters installed
may request, in lieu of paying the Flat Rate
Charge, that the City Engineer calculate an
alternative sewer rate based upon the number of
fixtures (i.e. sinks, toilets, etc) utilized on their
property.

water used pursuant to Section 13.12.020 (B)(1),
commercial and/or industrial users may request
that the City Engineer allow a reduction based on
the amount of water used by such business but
not actually discharged into the domestic sewer

13.14.110 Requirement to Prevent,
Control, and Reduce Storm Water Pollutants
Authorization to Adopt and Impose Best
Management Practices (BMP). Every person or
entity, undertaking any activity or use of
premises that may cause or contribute to storm
water pollution or contamination or illicit
discharges shall comply with best management
practice (BMPs) consistent with the California
Storm Water Quality Association (CASQA) Best
Management Practice Handbooks or equivalent
guidelines.
(a) Business-related Best Management
Practices:
1. Storm water Pollution Prevention
Plan. The City Engineer may require
any business within Ripon city limits
engaged in activities that may result
in pollutant discharges to develop and
implement a storm water pollution
prevention plan, in accordance with
the CASQA Best Management
Practice Handbook or equivalent
guidelines, which shall include an
employee training program. An
employee training program is a
documented employee training
program that may be required to be
implemented by a business pursuant
to a storm water pollution prevention
plan, for the purpose of educating its
employees on methods of reducing
discharge of pollutants to the storm
water conveyance system. These
business activities include, but are
not limited to, maintenance, storage,
manufacturing, assembly, equipment
operations, vehicle loading or

and Discharge Control 223 - 14 (10/15)
13.14.110
(b) Construction Activities:
1. Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
For any Construction Activity with
less than an acre of soil disturbance
or not subject to the Construction
General Permit, an Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan (ESCP) and
the ESCP Worksheet shall be
submitted to the City Engineer for
approval prior to the issuance of an
Encroachment Permit, Building
Permit, or approval of improvement
plans.
2. The ESCP shall comply with all
applicable Federal, State and local
laws, ordinances or regulations to
prevent pollutants from entering the
Storm Water Conveyance System,
including but not limited to, the
current California NPDES General
Permit for storm water discharges
associated with Construction Activity
and the City’s Urban Storm Water
Quality Management and Discharge
Control Ordinance. The ESCP, at a
minimum, provide details of
proposed BMPs for erosion and
sediment controls, soil stabilization,
dewatering, source controls, pollution
prevention measures and prohibiting
illicit discharges.
3. Any person subject to preparing an
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
shall comply with all provisions of
such permit. As required by its Phase
II MS4 NPDES Permit, the City will
conduct storm water compliance
inspections at applicable construction
sites that have areas of soil
disturbance exposed to storm water.
The inspection will be conducted by
the City Engineer or agent working
for the City who is a Qualified
SWPPP Practitioner (QSP) or is
supervised by a QSP. The inspection
will evaluate the construction site’s
compliance to the City’s Urban
Storm Water Quality Management
and Discharge Control Ordinance,
SWPPP, or ESCP. The following is
the risk rating system and inspection
frequency the City will use, which is
analogous to the risk rating used by
the California Construction General
Permit.
· Projects not subject to the
Construction General Permit or
that have an Erosivity Waiver
will have a pre-soil disturbance
inspection and a project
completion inspection.
· Projects that are Risk 1 / Linear
Underground Project (LUP) Type
1 or Risk 2 / LUP Type 2 will
have a pre-soil disturbance
inspection, monthly inspections,
and a project completion
inspection.
· Projects that are Risk 3 / LUP
Type 3 will have a pre-soil
disturbance inspection, bimonthly
(twice per month)
inspections, and a project
completion inspection.
If a project has been issued two
consecutive notices of violation or
does not correct a previously issued
notice of violation by the due date
Urban Storm Water Quality Management
and Discharge Control 223 - 15 (10/15)
13.14.110
set by the inspector, the project’s
“threat to water quality” will be
elevated by the City to the next
highest category. This elevation of
risk will not affect the risk rating for
the Construction General Permit.
(d) New Development and Redevelopment.
1. The City Engineer may require
controls as appropriate to minimize
the long-term, post-construction
activity discharge of storm water
pollutants from new Development(s)
or modifications to existing
Development(s). Controls may
include source control measures to
prevent pollution of storm water,
treatment controls designed to
remove pollutants from storm water,
low impact development measures,
and/or hydromodification measures
to offset the difference between the
pre and post-construction peak flow
runoff rates and volumes. Proponents
of all applicable Development
projects will be required to meet the
requirements and design standards
specified in the current State of
California Phase II MS4 NPDES
Permit and as described in further
detail in the City’s Storm Water
Development Standards.
2. Project proponents shall be
responsible to assume responsibility
for the Operation & Maintenance of
the post-construction storm water
t r e a tme n t s y s t em( s ) a n d
hydromodification control(s) (if any)
in an effective and good operational
condition. The project proponent
shall sign a Statement of
Responsibility for the ongoing
maintenance of the post-construction
treatment measures. The Statement of
Responsibility will be recorded
against the property. The project
proponent shall include in project
deeds and covenants that any future
owner or association assumes this
responsibility once the project is
legally transferred. This shall include
written a operation and maintenance
plan, which shall be submitted to and
approved by the City Engineer and
agreement to perform annual selfcertifications
as required by the City.
The annual self-certifications shall be
submitted by the current property
owner on January 1st of each year
after the installed treatment control
measures have been installed. If the
annual self-certification is not
submitted within 30 days, the Ripon
Engineering department will perform
an inspection of the installed
Treatment Control Measures. The
owner or responsible party will be
charged for the inspection in
accordance with section 13.14.220 of
this code. If the installed Treatment
Control Measures are not performing
as described in the O&M plan a
notice of violation will be sent to the
owner. (Ord. 827, 2015)

unavailable and time constraints are such that
service of a notice and order to abate cannot be
effected without presenting an immediate danger
to the public health, safety, welfare or
environment, or a violation of a NPDES permit,
the City may perform or cause to be performed
such work as shall be necessary to abate the
threat or danger, or permit violation.
(c) The costs of any such abatement shall be
borne by the property owner and/or other
responsible party, and shall be collectable in
accordance with the provisions of Section
13.14.220.
(d) The City Engineer may order the
immediate cessation of any activities that cause
an illicit discharge or cause or potentially cause

13.20.010 Purpose of provisions.
The city council is desirous of adopting an
extension policy that is fair and equitable for all
developing real properties, which will allow the
cost of the construction of certain off-site
improvements, facilities and extensions to be
distributed where applicable among subsequently
developing real properties connecting thereto or
adjacent thereto or using or benefiting from the
off-site improvement, facilities or extensions, as
provided in this chapter. The purpose of this
chapter is to make provision for assessment and
collecting of fees as a condition of the approval of
a final map, condition of development approval, or
as a condition of issuing a building permit of the
purpose of defraying the actual or estimated costs
of constructing certain public improvements
pursuant to the city’s authority to make and
enforce all ordinances and regulations with respect
to municipal affairs. This chapter shall be the
exclusive procedure for a reimbursement
agreement and/or the establishment and operation
of areas of benefit in the city. No area of benefit
shall be established under this chapter unless the
city council finds that the construction of the
public facilities or improvements provided for by
the area of benefit is required for subsequent
subdivisions and developments, and that the fees
are fairly apportioned within the area on either the
basis of benefits conferred on property proposed
for development or subdivision or on the need for
such facilities created by the proposed
development and the development of other
property within the area.

the terms under which such permit or variance is
granted, or if any one of the following findings are
made:

permits, and temporary land permits that the
continuance of the use would be detrimental to the
health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare of
persons residing or working in the neighborhood of
such use, or would be injurious or detrimental to
property and improvements in the neighborhood or
to the general welfare of the city;
B. In connection with variances, that continued
relief from the strict application of the terms of this
title would be detrimental to the health, safety,
comfort or general welfare of persons residing or

temporary land permit, it shall hold a public hearing
thereon, notice of which shall be served on the
owner of the subject property at least 10 days prior
to the date of the hearing, either personally or by
registered or certified mail, with postage prepaid and
return receipt requested. At the conclusion of the
hearing the deciding body shall make findings of
fact as to whether or not there is good cause for such
revocation. If it finds that such good cause does
exist, it may revoke or modify the permit or
variance. (Ord. 758, §2 (part), 2007)
16.06.110 Continuances.

made. (Ord. 758, §2 (part), 2007)
16.06.130 Conditions of approval.
A. To protect the general health and welfare of
all citizens, the deciding body may enforce
reasonable requirements when necessary or
appropriate to ensure a development or use
compatible to and harmonious with the particular
neighborhood and the established uses therein.
B. To ensure that the provisions of this title are
maintained, the deciding body may enforce
requirements more stringent than the minimum zone
requirements.
C. In granting approvals, time extension or
modifications thereof, the deciding body may
include such conditions as are reasonable and
necessary under the circumstances to carry out the
purpose of this title. Such conditions, without
limiting the discretion and authority of the deciding
body in this regard, may include site planning
conditions, architectural conditions, landscape
conditions, street dedication, street and drainage
improvements, off-street parking conditions and
outdoor advertising conditions. (Ord. 758, §2 (part),

approval is the date on which the deciding body
votes on the motion or resolution of approval. When
there is an appeal, the date of approval is the date of
the administrative vote on the motion or resolution
finally determining the appeal. (Ord. 758, §2 (part),
2007)
16.06.150 Use of approvals.
An approval is used if substantial construction
work, including grading, specifically for the project
is lawfully performed after the approval is granted,
in reliance on the approval and in reliance on validly
issued building permits. Or, when the project does
not involve substantial construction work, an
approval is acted on when the activity approved is
commenced in a substantial, as distinguished from
tentative or token, manner. (Ord. 758, §2 (part),
2007)

MIXED USE DISTRICT
Sections:
16.26.010 Purpose.
16.26.020 Permitted Uses.
16.26.030 Development Standards for Mixed
Use Districts.
Tables:
16.26.1 Permitted Uses.
16.26.2 Lot and Structure Standards.
16.26.010 Purpose.
The purpose of the MU (Mixed Use) District is
to provide for activity centers containing a mixture
of commercial, professional office and industrial
uses. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 782, 2011)
16.26.020 Permitted Uses.
Table 16.26.1 lists the permitted and
conditionally permitted use types in the Mixed Use
Zoning District, as defined in Chapter 16.12
Definitions and Use Classification Systems. (Ord.
652, §1, 2002; Ord. 782, 2011)
16.26.030. Development Standards for Mixed
Use Districts.
A. Site Plan Permit. A site plan permit is
required for all new projects and any project that
includes expanding, substantially modifying or
changing an existing use, as defined in Chapter
16.72 (Site Plan Permit Review) of this code.
B. Building Site Area Requirements. All uses
must be on a parcel sufficient to provide for the use,
open space, landscaping and off street parking.
C. Lots and Structure Standards. Unless
otherwise specified, all lots and structures shall
comply with the provisions in Table 16.26.2. (Ord.
815,2014)
D. Enclosed Buildings and Yards. All
permitted service and repair uses must be done
wholly within completely enclosed buildings. All
permitted storage uses must be done wholly within
a completely enclosed yard.
E. Off-Street Parking and Loading. Shall be
provided as prescribed in Chapter 16.144 (Parking
and Loading) of this code.
F. Landscaping. The minimum landscaping
requirements for the mixed use district shall be
determined by the type of development. For
example a use that would normally be classified as
commercial, as determined by the Director, shall
comply with the commercial landscaping
requirements and a use that would normally be
classified as light industrial, as determined by the
Director, shall comply with the industrial
landscaping requirements. A landscaping plan for
all uses indicating plant species, initial size, location,
method of irrigation, and growth characteristics
consistent with any adopted standard details must be
approved by City Staff prior to issuance of any
permits. The required landscaping must be installed
prior to final inspection and must be maintained by
the property owner. Landscaping and irrigation shall
be in compliance with Chapter 16.148 (Landscaping
and Irrigation).
G. Trash Enclosures. Fully enclosed trash
collection areas shall be provided at locations that
are readily accessible to occupants and sanitation
collectors.
H. Masonry Wall. An eight (8) foot masonry
wall must be constructed along the property line that
is adjacent to any residential district or any property
designated for residential land uses in the General
Plan.
I. Sewer and Water. All permitted and
conditionally permitted uses shall only be allowed if
served by public water and sewer.
J. Street Improvements. Street improvements,
including but not limited to curb, gutter, sidewalk
321 (9/15)
16.26.030
and drainage facilities, are required as a condition
for development. This requirement will be based on
the impact the development will have on traffic. If
the development of the property would have such an
impact on traffic that street improvements are
required, the property may still be exempt from this
requirement if, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, there is some reason why the
improvements should not be immediately
constructed. In that case, may be deferred upon
execution of a deferred street improvement
agreement which must be executed between the
property owner and the City Council.
K. Loading Docks. Loading docks shall be
designed and located on the site so that all trucks
have the ability to maneuver on site without
intruding into the public right-of-way, or block any
driveways, or disturb any parking area circulation.
Loading docks shall be designed so that no vehicles
are required to back to or from an adjacent street.
L. Pollution Control. All uses shall be planned,
developed, conducted, and operated in such a
manner that noise, smoke, dust, odors, and waste of
any kind is purified to control pollution of air, soil or
water to meet the standards or requirements of the
planning commission.
M. Air Quality. All emissions are subject to the
rules and regulations of the San Joaquin Valley
Unified Air Pollution Control District.
1. Surface Preparation, Painting, or Coating
Activities. All surface preparation, painting, or
coating activities must be conducted entirely within
a enclosed building.
N. Odor. All uses must be operated as not to
cause odors that are perceptible and offensive to the
average person at any residential lot line. Primary
and secondary safeguard systems must be provided
to control odors.
O. Recycling of Wood and Concrete Waste
Material. Pursuant to the requirements of AB 939
and local provisions for the diversion of recyclable
materials from the waste stream, all wood and
concrete waste material generated as by development
shall be separated and removed to an authorized
recycling center.
P. Automatic Fire Sprinkler System. Automatic
fire sprinkler systems shall be installed in all
structures over five thousand (5,000) square feet in
size, unless waived by the Fire District or City
Council.
Q. Construction Noise. Unless otherwise
waived by the City Council, construction activities
generating noise above 70db at the property line on
any lot adjacent to residential uses shall not occur
before 7:00 a.m. or after 7:00 P.M. Monday through
Saturday, and before 10:00 a.m. or after 6:00 P.M.
on Sunday. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 719 §1, 2005;
Ord. 782, 2011)
R. Development Impact Fees. For purposes of
determining the applicable development impact fees
for projects within the Mixed Use zone, City staff
shall make a determination as to whether the project
is predominantly commercial, professional office or
industrial, and/or whether it is feasable to
characterize portions of the project as commercial,
professional office or industrial. Based upon this
determination, development impact fees as set forth
in the Public Facilities Financing Plan will be
allocated to the project and shall be imposed at the
time of project approval. (Ord. 824, 2015)

Table:
16.32.1 Permitted Uses.
16.32.010 Purpose.
The public and semipublic district allows for the
location and development of large public and
semipublic uses, as shown in Table 16.32.1, within
a separate zoning district. In addition to this general
purpose, some specific purposes are listed below.
A. Allows consideration of the establishment or
expansion of a large public or semipublic use at
rezoning hearings rather than at use permit hearings
only. Notice is given to all of the extent of a site
approval for a large public or semipublic use
showing it on the district map.
B. Allow the Planning Commission and City
Council to consider the most appropriate use of a site
following discontinuance of a large public or
semipublic use without the encumbrance of a base
district that may or may not provide appropriate
regulations for reuse of the site. (Ord. 606, 1999;
Ord. 758, §2 (part), 2007; Ord. 782, 2011)
16.32.020 Permitted Uses.
Table 16.32.1 shows permitted uses and uses
permitted with a use permit. (Ord. 606, 1999) Uses
considered retail or service related that are
non-government uses shall follow the same
development standards as the District. (Ord. 758, §2
(part), 2007; Ord. 782, 2011)
16.32.030 Required Conditions.
Required Area. Public Facilities sites must be at
least one acre. Sites less than one acre are subject to
the regulations of the surrounding district.
Design Review. All uses in the PS District are
subject to Staff Review or Site Plan Review. The
procedure used will be at the discretion of the
Director.
Development Standards. Landscaping, setbacks
and other development standards shall be as set forth
in Chapter 16.24, unless otherwise approved by the
Planning Commission.
Termination of Use. If a use is discontinued, the
Planning Commission must review the site to
determine the appropriate use for the property. (Ord.
606,1999; Ord. 758, §2 (part), 2007; Ord. 782, 2011)

16.36.080 Status of a PD Plan.
16.36.010 Purpose.
The purpose and intent of the planned
development overlay district regulations contained
in this chapter is to provide for a type of
development that allows for greater flexibility than
otherwise allowed under normal zoning regulations
and standards in return for a coordinated
development that provides public benefits not
otherwise part of the development process. The
planned development overlay district is not a
mechanism to circumvent City standards, rather it is
a tool to allow for creative and imaginative design
that will promote amenities beyond those expected
in conventional development. The planned
development overlay district is intended to further
accomplish the following purposes:
A. To encourage imagination and a greater mix
of housing variety and even sometimes a mix of
residential and commercial or professional office
land uses designed in a complementary manner that
emphasizes synergy.
B. Simplify the processing of proposed projects
by providing a method of concurrent review of land
use, subdivision and siting considerations.
C. To insure that the goals and objectives of the
City’s General Plan are promoted without the
discouragement of innovation by application of
restrictive development standards.
D. Encourage diversity in housing types, styles,
and price ranges, but with design standards that
maintain community character.
E. Encourage the use of more common open
space areas and the inclusion of other amenities in
project design than likely under conventional
development standards
F. Encourage the efficient use of land,
particularly those parcels that are unique in physical
characteristics or other circumstances to warrant
special methods of development.
G. Encourage variety and avoid monotony in
large developments by allowing greater freedom in
selecting the means to provide access, light, open
space, and conveniences. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.36.020 Land Use Regulations.
Planned Developments are permitted in any
district. The planning commission and city council
may permit any use in the PD district which is
compatible with the purposes of this title, the
neighborhood and general vicinity of the proposed
project, and in keeping with protection of the public
health, safety and general welfare. No use other than
an existing use is permitted in a PD Overlay District
except in accord with a valid PD Plan or Specific
Plan. Any permitted or conditional use authorized by
this Title may be included in an approved PD Plan or
an adopted Specific Plan, consistent with the
General Plan. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.36.030 Development Plan Regulations,
Objectives and Evaluations
A. Regulations
1. Minimum Area. There is no minimum site
area for a PD District. The appropriateness of using
a PD District shall be determined by the Director of
Planning in his/her sole discretion on a case-by-case
basis based upon the specific characteristics of the
site and the need to provide additional zoning control
by establishing site specific conditions of approval
and standards for a specific PD District.
2. Residential Density. The total number of
328 (9/15)
16.36.030
dwelling units in a PD shall not exceed the number
permitted for the underlying zoning district or by the
General Plan density for the total area of parcels
designated for residential use and for open space.
The density bonus provisions of Section 16.16.070
may apply.
3. Development Standards. Development
standards defined in Chapters 16.16, 16.20, 16.24
and 16.26 will apply.
4. Road Widths and Standards shall be as
defined in the City of Ripon’s Standard
Specifications and Standard Details per the type of
density being proposed. All streets, whether public
or private shall meet City of Ripon standards.
5. Latitude of Regulations. The Planning
Commission may recommend and the City Council
may adopt as part of the preliminary development
plans, and may require in the final development
plan; standards, regulations, limitations and
restrictions which are either more or less restrictive
than those specified within an alternate zoning
district which would be applicable if the PD district
were not proposed, and which are designed to
protect and maintain property values and community
amenities in the subject community, and which
would foster and maintain the health, safety and
general welfare of the community. If standards,
regulations, limitations and restrictions which are
less strict than those specified in the code are
proposed, the applicant shall prepare alternate plans,
as determined necessary by the Director of Planning,
which comply with the applicable standards,
regulations, limitations and restrictions, to allow a
comparison of floor area ratio or densities between
the proposed plan and the plan which complies with
all applicable standards. The floor area ratio or
densities of the proposed project shall be limited to
be comparable with the alternate plan, unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Commission or
City Council, as a result of demonstrated benefits to
the project and/or neighborhood resulting from the
proposed plan. The standards, regulations,
limitations and restrictions may include, but are not
limited to the following:
a. Height limitations on buildings and
structures;
b. Percent coverage of land by buildings
and structures;
c. Parking ratios and areas expressed in
relation to use of various portions of the property
and/or building floor area;
d. The location, width and improvement
of vehicular and pedestrian access to various
portions of the property including portions within
abutting streets;
e. Planting and maintenance of trees,
shrubs, plants and lawns in accordance with a
landscaping plan;
f. Construction of fences, walls and
floodlighting of an approved design;
g. Limitations upon the size, design,
number, lighting and location of signs and
advertising structures;
h. Arrangement and spacing of buildings
and structures to provide appropriate open spaces
around same;
i. Location, design, screening and size of
off-street loading areas and docks;
j. Uses of buildings and structures by
general classification, and by specific designation
when there are unusual requirements for parking, or
when use involves noise, dust, odor, fumes, smoke,
vibration, glare or radiation incompatible with
present or potential development of surrounding
property;
k. Architectural design of buildings and
structures;
l. Schedule of time for construction and
establishment of the proposed buildings, structures,
or land uses or any stage of development thereof;
and
m. Requiring of performance bonds to
ensure development as approved.
B. Design Objectives - To achieve design and
aesthetic quality for large-scale integrated
developments, infill developments, and/or General
329 (9/15)
16.36.030
Plan special areas of concern, the following design
objectives shall be met:
1. Building bulk, height, land coverage,
visual appearance from adjacent land, and design
compatibility with existing adjoining development
and land which will remain, shall be considered and
controlled.
2. A development’s design should
successfully integrate individual buildings and the
building groups with the surrounding development,
other physical features in the area, and existing
development which will remain.
3. The design of structures should provide
for harmonious composition of mass, scale, color,
and textures, with special emphasis on the transition
from one (1) building type to another, termination of
groups of structures, relationships to streets,
exploitation of views, and integration of spaces and
building forms with the topography of the site and
the urban or suburban character of the area.
4. Provisions shall be made for an efficient,
direct and convenient system of pedestrian
circulation, together with landscaping and
appropriate treatment of any public areas or lobbies.
5. Off-street parking and loading areas
should be integrated into the overall vehicular
circulation system.
C. Evaluations. When approving and adopting the
rezoning application, the preliminary development
plan or the final development plan, the Planning
Commission and/or the City Council as the case may
be, shall be satisfied that:
1. The applicant intends to start construction
within two (2) years from the effective date of the
ordinance for the zoning change and plan approval;
2. The proposed planned unit development
is consistent with the General Plan;
3. In the case of residential development, it
will constitute a residential environment of sustained
desirability and stability, and will be in harmony
with the character of the surrounding neighborhood
and community;
4. In the case of commercial development,
it is needed at the proposed location to provide
adequate commercial facilities of the type proposed,
and that traffic congestion will not likely be created
by the proposed center, or will be obviated by
presently projected improvements and by
demonstrable provisions in the plan for entrances
and exits, and by internal provisions for traffic and
parking, and that the development will be an
attractive and efficient center which will fit
harmoniously into and will have no adverse effects
upon the adjacent or surrounding developments;
5. The development of a harmonious,
integrated plan justifies exceptions from the normal
application of the code.

Structures and Sites.
It is sometimes in the public interest to retain the
historic appearance of a neighborhood or site to
make an exception to normal setback, parking,
landscaping, fencing and screening requirements of
Ripon’s ordinances and codes when the exception
does not interfere with health and safety. The City
Council or Planning Commission may initiate or
approve exceptions to Ripon’s land use regulations
for properties in Historic Districts. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.44.050 Eligibility for Local Historical

nation.
F. The area of its structures embody elements
of outstanding attention to architectural or landscape
design, detail, materials or craftsmanship.
G. The area is related to a designated
historic building or district so its
preservation is essential to the integrity of the
building or district
H. The area’s unique location or singular
characteristics represent an established and familiar
visual feature of a neighborhood.
I. The area has potential for yielding
information of archaeological interest.

16.44.070 Criteria for Designating
Landmark Buildings.
Individual buildings may be designated as
historically significant landmarks if one or more of
the criteria listed in Section 16.44.060 are met. A
LANDMARK so designated is eligible for the same
review procedures as building within an H district.
(Ord. 606, 1999)
16.44.080 Review of Permits.
A. Reclassifications, use permits, variances,
site plan reviews and tentative subdivision maps
within the boundaries of the HO district must be
reviewed by the Planning Commission for
significant historical or cultural characteristics.
Applications for building permits for alterations,
relocations, demolition or new construction within
the HO district must also be reviewed.
B. Every application for approval in relation to
property in the HO district must be accompanied by
plans, photographs, specifications and a written
statement fully describing the proposed work.
C. At a regular meeting, as soon as practical,
following the submittal, the Planning Commission
must consider the application to determine if the
proposed action will adversely affect the
preservation and architectural character of the area
or site.
D. The Commission shall forward its
recommendation to the Building Official or City
Council. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.44.090 Review Procedure
A. The Building Official shall not issue a
permit for construction, alteration or demolition of a
building or structure in an HO district or of a
designated landmark without prior approval of the
Planning Commission. Prior approval by the
Planning Commission is not required for permit
applications of an emergency nature or those
necessary to repair an unsafe building or to demolish
a structure for safety reasons.
B. If after review of a request for a demolition
permit, the Planning Commission determines a
structure to be of historical, cultural, or architectural
interest or value, the Commission may withhold
approval for demolition for one hundred eighty (180)
days from the Commission’s action, or until an
environmental review is completed. During this
period the Commission may direct the staff to
consult with recognized historic preservation
organizations and other civic groups, public agencies
and interested citizens for recommendations. Staff
may make suggestions for acquisition of property by
public or private bodies or agencies, explore the
333 Ripon (1-00)
16.44.090
possibility of moving one or more of the structures
or other features, and take other reasonable
measures.
At the end of the review period, the demolition
permit must be issued if an environmental review
determines that there shall not be a significant
impact on the environment and all regulations of this
chapter are met, or if there may be substantial
environmental impacts, that a finding is made that
specific economic, social or other considerations
make infeasible the mitigation measures or
alternatives identified during the environmental
review.
C. If, after review of the request for a
demolition permit, the Planning Commission
determines that the building or structure has no
substantial historical, cultural or architectural
interest or value, a demolition permit may be issued.
D. The Planning Commission must recommend
against approval of new construction or alterations
in HO districts unless it finds that the proposed
action will be compatible with and help achieve the
purposes of the HO district.
E. Review and comment by the Planning
Commission is required before the removal or
alteration of landscape materials identified as
significant resources. Removal or alteration of such
materials shall require a finding that the proposed
action will not adversely affect the character of the
HO district, or that the safety of persons or property
requires the removal or alteration. No provision of
this subsection shall be construed as restricting
routine maintenance of landscape materials.
(Ord. 606, 1999)
16.44.100 Maintenance of Structures and
Premises.
All property owners in HO districts and owners
of designated landmarks shall have the obligation to
maintain structures and premises in good repair.
Good repair includes and is the level of maintenance
that insures the continued availability of the
structure and premises for a lawfully permitted use,
and prevents deterioration, dilapidation and decay of
the exterior portions of the structure and premises.

16.86.050 Parking Standards.
The parking requirement for an Accessory
Dwelling Unit shall be one off-street parking
space per unit. This space shall comply with
all requirements set forth in Chapter
16.144 Parking and Loading.
Notwithstanding Chapter 16.144, this space
may be provided as tandem parking,
including on an existing driveway or in a
side or rear yard area, unless specific
findings are made by the Community
Development Director that parking in
setback areas or tandem parking is not
feasible based upon fire and life safety
conditions.
A. Exceptions. Notwithstanding the
parking requirement in this section, no offstreet
parking shall be required for an
Accessory Dwelling Unit in any of the
following instances:
1. The Accessory Dwelling Unit
is within an existing primary dwelling or an
existing accessory structure.
2. The Accessory Dwelling Unit
is located within one-half (½) mile of a
public transit stop or station.

rental service pick-up/drop-off location
within one (1) block of the Accessory
Dwelling Unit.
B. Replacement Parking: When a
garage, carport, or covered parking structure
is demolished or converted in conjunction
with the construction of an Accessory
Dwelling Unit, replacement of the number
of parking space(s) meeting the
requirements of Chapter 16.144 Parking and
Loading shall be required.
Notwithstanding Chapter 16.144, such
replacement parking may be located in any
configuration on the same lot, including, but
not limited to, as covered spaces, uncovered
spaces, or tandem spaces, including on an
existing driveway or in a side or rear yard
area, unless specific findings are made by
the Community Development Director that
parking in setback areas or tandem parking
is not feasible based upon fire and life safety
conditions.
16.86.060 Occupancy, Rental and
Sale Limitations
Before issuing a building permit for an
Accessory Dwelling Unit the property
owner shall file with the San Joaquin
County Recorder a declaration or an
agreement of restrictions, which has been
approved by the City Attorney as to its form
and content, containing a reference to the
deed under which the property was acquired
by the owner and stating that:
A. The Accessory Dwelling Unit shall
not be sold separately from the primary
dwelling; and
B The Accessory Dwelling Unit shall
not be rented for a period of less than thirty
(30) days; and

354 (9/18)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit one or both of the units remaining
vacant. This owner-occupancy requirement
may be temporarily waived for a period of
not more than one (1) year if the Planning
Commission finds that the owner has an
unavoidable reason for absence and if the
owner appoints in writing another person to
occupy and take responsibility for
maintaining the property. All properties
approved for Accessory Dwelling Units
must be maintained at a level consistent with
the neighborhood in which it is located; and

harmonious with a residential environment and to
protect neighborhoods from the negative impacts
that home occupations may have on a residential
area. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.88.020 Permitted Uses.

16.88.040 Review Procedures.
A. The home occupation permits shall be
reviewed by the Director of Planning and
Economic Development.

The purpose of this Chapter is to establish
general guidelines for the siting of wireless
communications towers and antennas. The goals of
this Chapter are to:
(1) protect residential areas and land uses
from potential adverse impacts of towers and
antennas;
(2) encourage the location of towers in
non-residential areas;
(3) minimize the total number of towers
throughout the community;
(4) strongly encourage the joint use of new
and existing tower sites as a primary option rather
than construction of additional single-use towers;
(5) encourage users of towers and antennas to
locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where
the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(6) encourage users of towers and antennas to
configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse
visual impact of the towers and antennas
through careful design, siting, landscape screening,
and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(7) enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunications services to provide such
services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently;
(8) consider the public health and safety of
communication towers; and
(9) avoid potential damage to adjacent
properties from tower failure through engineering
and careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance
of these goals, the City of Ripon shall give due
consideration to the City of Ripon's general plan,
specific plans, zoning map, existing land uses, and
environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites
for the location of towers and antennas. (Ord. 678

representing or warranting that such sites are
available or suitable.
(d) Aesthetics. Notwithstanding Section
16.90.080, towers and antennas shall meet the
following requirements:
(1) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized
steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of
the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce
visual obtrusiveness.
(2) At a tower site, the design of the wireless
service facility, buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend
them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure
other than a tower, the antenna and supporting
electrical and mechanical equipment and related
structures must be of a neutral color that is identical
to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and
related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible.
(e) Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially
lighted, unless required by the FAA or other
applicable authority. If lighting is required, the
lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause
the least disturbance to the surrounding views
(f) Noise. All wireless service facilities shall
be constructed and operated in such a manner as to
minimize the amount of noise impacts to residents of
nearby homes and the users of recreational areas,
such as public parks and trails. Noise attenuation
measures shall be required for all air-conditioning
units. Backup generators shall only be operated
during power outages and for testing and
maintenance purposes. At any time, noise
attenuation measures may be required by the
Planning Department when deemed necessary.
Testing and maintenance activities of wireless
service facilities which generate audible noise shall
occur between the hours of eight o'clock (8:00) A.M.
and five o'clock (5:00) P.M., weekdays (Monday
through Friday, non-holiday) excluding emergency
repairs, unless allowed at other times by the
Planning Department. Testing and maintenance
activities that do not generate audible noise may
occur at any time, unless otherwise restricted by the
Planning Department.
(g) Landscaping. The following requirements
shall govern the landscaping surrounding wireless
service facilities for which a special use permit is
required; provided, however, that the Planning
Commission may waive such requirements if the
goals of this Chapter would be better served thereby.
(i) Wireless service facilities shall be
361 (6/08)
16.90.040
landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that
effectively screens the view of the facility from
property used for residences. The standard buffer
shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4)
feet wide outside the perimeter of the facility.
(ii) In locations where the visual impact of the
wireless service facilities would be minimal, the
landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived
by the Planning Commission.
(iii) Existing mature tree growth and natural
landforms on the site shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth
around the property perimeter may be sufficient
buffer.
(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
landscaping shall comply with the requirements for
the District in which the personal wireless facility is
located as set forth in Chapter 16.148 of the
Development Title.
(h) State or Federal Requirements. All
towers and antennas must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and
any other agency of the state or federal government
with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.
If such standards and regulations are changed, then
the owners of the towers and antennas governed by
this Chapter shall bring such towers and antennas
into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations within six (6) months of the effective
date of such standards and regulations, unless a
different compliance schedule is mandated by the
controlling state or federal agency. Further, the
owner shall provide written notification to the
Planning Department of compliance with such
revised standards and regulations. Failure to bring
towers and antennas into compliance with such
revised standards and regulations shall constitute
grounds for the immediate removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
(i) Building Codes; Safety Standards. To
ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of
a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable
state or local building codes and the applicable
standards for towers that are published by the
Electronic Industries Association, as amended from
time to time. If, upon inspection, the City of Ripon
concludes that a tower fails to comply with such
codes and standards and constitutes a danger to
persons or property, then upon notice being provided
to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty
(30) days to bring such tower into compliance with
such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said thirty (30) days shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
(j) Measurement. For purposes of
measurement, tower setbacks and separation
distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities
located in the City of Ripon irrespective of
municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries.
(k) Not Essential Services. Towers and
antennas shall be regulated and permitted pursuant
to this Chapter and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities, or
private utilities.

may, in order to encourage the use of monopoles,
administratively allow the reconstruction of an
existing tower to monopole construction.
(7) If an administrative approval is denied,
the applicant shall file an application for a use
permit pursuant to Section 16.90.070 prior to filing
any appeal that may be available under the
Development Title.

(b) List of Administratively Approved Uses.
The following uses may be approved by the
Planning Department after conducting an
administrative review:
(1) Locating a tower or antenna, including the
placement of additional buildings or other
supporting structure or equipment used in
connection with said tower or antenna, in any
industrial district (as defined in the Development
Title).
(2) Locating antennas on existing structures
or towers consistent with the terms of subsections (a)
and (b) below.
(a) Antennas on existing structures. Any
antenna that is not attached to a tower may be
approved by the Planning Department as an
accessory use to any commercial, industrial,
professional or institutional structure, provided:
(i) The antenna does not extend more than
thirty (30) feet above the highest point of the
structure;
(ii) The antenna complies with all applicable
FCC and FAA regulations; and
(iii)The antenna complies with all applicable
building codes and state or federal requirements.
(b) Antennas on existing towers. An
antenna which is attached to an existing tower may
be approved by the Planning Department and, to
minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the
proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of
antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers
shall take precedence over the construction of new
towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in
a manner consistent with the following:
(i) A tower that is modified or reconstructed
to accommodate the collocation of an additional
antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the Planning Department
allows reconstruction as a monopole.
(ii) Height. Subject to Section 16.90.060
(b)(3);
(a) An existing tower may be modified or
rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed thirty (30)
feet over the tower's existing height, to
accommodate the collocation of an additional
antenna.
(b) The height change referred to in
subsection (ii)(a) may only occur one time per
communication tower.
(c) The additional height referred to in
subsection (ii)(a) shall not require an additional
distance separation as set forth in Section 16.90.070.
The tower's premodification height shall be used to
calculate such distance separations.
(iii) Onsite location.
(a) A tower that is being rebuilt to
accommodate the collocation of an additional
antenna may be moved onsite within fifty (50) feet
of its existing location.
(b) After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate
collocation, only one tower may remain on the site.
(c) A relocated onsite tower shall continue to
be measured from the original tower location for
purposes of calculating separation distances between
towers pursuant to Section 16.90.070 (b)(5). The
relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way be
deemed to cause a violation of Section 16.90.070
(b)(5).
(d) The onsite relocation of a tower which
comes within the separation distances to residential
units or residentially zoned lands as established in
Section 16.90.070 (b)(5) shall only be permitted
when approved by the Planning Commission.
(3) New towers in non-residential districts.
Locating any new tower in a non-residential district,
provided a licensed professional engineer certifies
the tower can structurally accommodate the number
of shared users proposed by the applicant; the
Planning Department concludes the tower is in
364 (6/08)
16.90.060
conformity with the goals set forth in Section
16.90.010 and the requirements of Section
16.90.040; the tower meets the setback requirements
in Section 16.90.070 (b)(4) and separation distances
in Section 16.90.070 (b)(5); and the tower meets the
following height and usage criteria:
(i) for a single user, up to ninety (90) feet in
height;
(ii) for two users, up to one hundred twenty
(120) feet in height; and
(iii) for three or more users, up to one hundred
fifty (150) feet in height.
(4) Installing a cable microcell network
through the use of multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to existing wireline
systems, such as conventional cable or telephone
wires, or similar technology that does not require the
use of towers. (Ord. 678 §1, 2003; Ord. 758, §2
(part), 2007)
16.90.070. Special Use Permits.
(a) General. The following provisions shall
govern the issuance of use permits for towers or
antennas by the Planning Commission:
(1) If the tower or antenna is not a permitted
use under Section 16.90.050 of this Chapter or
permitted to be approved administratively pursuant
to Section 16.90.060 of this Chapter, or in any
instance in which the Planning Director so
determines, then a use permit shall be required for
the construction of a tower or the placement of an
antenna in all zoning districts.
(2) Applications for special use permits under
this Section shall be subject to the procedures and
requirements of Chapter 16.76 of the Development
Title, except as modified in this Section.
(3) In granting a use permit, the Planning
Commission may impose conditions to the extent the
Planning Commission concludes such conditions are
necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the
proposed tower and facilities on adjoining
properties. Such factors include but are not limited
to:
(a) Health consequences; and
(b) Economic injury to property.
(4) Any information of an engineering nature
that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical,
or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed

(viii) A notarized statement by the applicant as
to whether construction of the tower will
accommodate collocation of additional antennas for
future users.
(ix) Identification of the entities providing the
backhaul network for the tower(s) described in the
application and other cellular sites owned or
operated by the applicant within the City of Ripon.
(x) A description of the suitability of the use
of existing towers, other structures or alternative
technology not requiring the use of towers or
structures to provide the services to be provided
through the use of the proposed new tower.
(xi) A description of the feasible location(s) of
future towers or antennas within the City of Ripon
based upon existing physical, engineering,
technological or geographical limitations in the
event the proposed tower is erected.
(2) Factors Considered in Granting Use
Permits for Towers. In addition to any standards for
consideration of special use permit applications
pursuant to Chapter 16.76 of the Development Title,
the Planning Commission shall consider the
following factors in determining whether to issue a
use permit, although the Planning Commission may
waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one
or more of these criteria if the Planning Commission
concludes that the goals of this Chapter are better
served thereby:
(i) Height of the proposed tower;
(ii) Proximity of the tower to residential
structures and residential district boundaries;
(iii) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby
properties;
(iv) Surrounding topography;
(v) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(vi) Design of the tower, with particular
reference to design characteristics that have the
effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
(vii) Proposed ingress and egress; and
(viii) Availability of suitable existing towers,
other structures, or alternative technologies not
requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in Section 16.90.070 (b)(3) of this
ordinance.
(3) Availability of Suitable Existing Towers,
Other Structures, or Alternative Technology. No
new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Planning Commission that no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology that does not
require the use of towers or structures can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An
applicant shall submit information requested by the
Planning Department related to the availability of
366 (6/08)
16.90.070
suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or
alternative technology can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of
the following:
(i) No existing towers or structures are
located within the geographic area that meets
applicant's engineering requirements.
(ii) Existing towers or structures are not of
sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering
requirements.
(iii) Existing towers or structures do not have
sufficient structural strength to support applicant's
proposed antenna and related equipment.
(iv) The applicant's proposed antenna would
cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna
on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna
on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(v) The fees, costs, or contractual provisions
required by the owner in order to share an existing
tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to
be unreasonable.
(vi) The applicant demonstrates that there are
other limiting factors that render existing towers and
structures unsuitable.
(vii) The applicant demonstrates that an
alternative technology that does not require the use
of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system,
is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that
exceed new tower or antenna development shall not
be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
(4) Setbacks. The following setback
requirements shall apply to all towers for which a
special use permit is required; provided, however,
that the Planning Commission may reduce the
standard setback requirements if the goals of this
Chapter would be better served thereby:
(i) Towers must be set back a distance equal
to at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the height
of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
(ii) Guys and accessory buildings or
structures must satisfy the minimum zoning district
setback requirements.
(5) Separation. The following separation
requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas
for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Planning Commission may reduce
the standard separation requirements if the goals of
this Chapter would be better served thereby.
(i) Separation from off-site uses/designated
areas.
(a) Tower separation shall be measured from
the base of the tower to the lot line of the off-site
uses and/or designated areas as specified in Table
16.90.070.1, except as otherwise provided in Table
16.90.070.2.
(b) Separation requirements for towers shall
comply with the minimum standards established in
Table 16.90.070.1.
(ii) Separation distances between towers.
(a) Separation distances between towers shall
be applicable for and measured between the
proposed tower and preexisting towers. The
separation distances shall be measured by drawing or
following a straight line between the base of the
existing tower and the proposed base, pursuant to a
site plan, of the proposed tower. The separation
distances (listed in linear feet) shall be as shown in
Table 16.90.070.2.
367 (6/08)
16.90.070
(6) Security fencing. Towers shall be
enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in
height and shall also be equipped with an
appropriate anti-climbing device; provided however,
that the Planning Commission may waive such
requirements, as it deems appropriate. (Ord. 678 §1,
2003; Ord. 758, §2 (part), 2007)

16.90.080. Aesthetics of Wireless Service
Facilities.
(a) All wireless service facilities shall be
located so as to minimize their visibility and, unless
otherwise determined by the Planning Department,
to be hidden from view, designed to ensure that they
will not appear as an antenna or tower facility. To
minimize visual impacts, all wireless service
facilities shall incorporate appropriate stealth
techniques to camouflage, disguise and/or blend
them into the surrounding environment. Wireless
service facilities shall be in scale and architecturally
integrated with surrounding building design(s) or
natural setting in such a manner as to be visually
unobtrusive. (b) Antennas mounted on structures
or on architectural details of a building shall be
treated to match existing architectural features and
colors found on the building. Façade-mounted
antennas shall be integrated into the building's
architecture through design, color, and texture.
(c) Roof-mounted antennas shall be located
in an area of the roof where the visual impact is
minimized. Roof-mounted and ground-mounted
antennas shall not be allowed when they are placed
in direct line of sight of significant or sensitive view
corridors or where they adversely affect scenic
vistas, unless facilities incorporate appropriate,
creative stealth techniques to camouflage, disguise,
and/or blend them into the surrounding environment,
as determined by Planning Department.
(d) Aboveground and partially buried
equipment cabinets shall be located where they will
be the least visible from surrounding properties and
public places. Aboveground and partially buried
equipment cabinets shall require screening from
surrounding properties and public view. Any visible
portion of an equipment cabinet shall be treated to
be architecturally compatible with surrounding
structures and/or screened using appropriate
techniques to camouflage, disguise, and/or blend it
into the environment. If the Planning Department
determines that an equipment cabinet is not or
cannot be adequately screened from adjacent
properties or from public view or architecturally
treated to blend in with the environment, the
equipment cabinet shall be placed underground or
inside the existing building where the antenna is
located.
(e) The height of a personal wireless service
facility shall include the height of any structure upon
which it is placed.
(f) The height of a wireless service facility
shall be based on a visual analysis demonstrating
that views of the facility are minimized or are
substantially screened from residential land uses, or
other sensitive land uses such as parks, schools, or
major streets, and on an engineering analysis
justifying the height of the proposed wireless service
facility.
(g) The visible exterior surfaces of wireless
service facilities shall be constructed out of
nonreflective materials.
(h) All colors and materials are subject to the
Planning Department's approval. The colors and
materials of antennas, equipment cabinets,
structures, and other appurtenances shall be chosen
to minimize the visibility of the wireless service
facility, except as specifically required by the FAA.
Facilities, which will be primarily viewed against
soils, trees, or grasslands, shall be painted colors
matching these landscapes. (i) Lightning arrester
rods and beacon lights shall not be included as part
of the design of any wireless service facility, unless
the wireless service provider can prove that it is
369 (6/08)
16.90.080
necessary for health and safety purposes, or required
by the FAA.
(j) The requirements of Sections 16.90.080
(a) through (i) may be modified by the Planning
Department in the case of administratively approved
uses or by the Planning Commission in the case of
uses permitted by special use to encourage
collocation. (Ord. 678 §1, 2003)
16.90.090. Removal of Abandoned Antennas
and Towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be
considered abandoned, and he owner of such
antenna or tower shall remove the same within
ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the City of
Ripon notifying the owner of such abandonment.
Failure to remove an abandoned antenna or tower
within said ninety (90) day shall be grounds for the
City of Ripon to remove the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a
single tower, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the tower. (Ord.
678 §1, 2003)
16.90.100. Nonconforming Uses.
(a) Not Expansion of Nonconforming Use.
Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are
installed, in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter shall not be deemed to constitute the
expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
(b) Preexisting towers. Preexisting towers
shall be allowed to continue their usage as they
presently exist. Routine maintenance (including
replacement with a new tower of like construction
and height) shall be permitted on such preexisting
towers. New construction other than routine
maintenance on a preexisting tower shall comply
with the requirements of this Chapter.
(c) Rebuilding Damaged or Destroyed
Nonconforming Towers or Antennas.
Notwithstanding Section 16.90.090, bona fide
nonconforming towers or antennas that are damaged
or destroyed may be rebuilt without having to first
obtain administrative approval or a use permit and
without having to meet the separation requirements
specified in Sections 16.90.070 (b)(4) and 16.90.070
(b)(5). The type, height, and location of the tower
onsite shall be of the same type and intensity as the
original facility approval. Building permits to
rebuild the facility shall comply with the then
applicable building codes and shall be obtained
within 180 days from the date the facility is damaged
or destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if said
permit expires, the tower or antenna shall be deemed
abandoned as specified in Section 16.90.090. (Ord.
678 §1, 2003)
16.90.110. Indemnity and Liability.
(a) The owners of wireless service facilities
located in the City of Ripon shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the City of Ripon or any of its
boards, commissions, agents, officers, and
employees from any claim, action or proceeding
against the City of Ripon, its boards, commissions,
agents, officers, or employees to attack, set aside,
void, or annul, the approval of any proposed antenna
or tower, unless such claim, action or proceeding is
based on the negligence or misconduct of the City of
Ripon, when such claim or action is brought within
the time period provided by in applicable state and
local statutes. The City of Ripon shall promptly
notify the owners of any such claim, action or
proceeding. Nothing contained in this subsection
shall prohibit the City of Ripon from participating in
370 (6/08)
16.90.100
a defense of any claim, action or proceeding if the
City bears its own attorney fees and costs, and the
City defends the action in good faith.
(b) The owners of wireless service facilities
shall be strictly liable for any and all sudden and
accidental pollution and gradual pollution from the
usage of their wireless service facilities located
within the City of Ripon. This liability shall include
clean-up, injury or damage to persons or property.
Additionally, wireless service providers shall be
responsible for any sanctions, fines, or other
monetary costs imposed as a result of the release of
pollutants from the operation of their wireless
service facilities.
(c) The owners of wireless service facilities
located in the City of Ripon shall be strictly liable
for any and all damages resulting from
electromagnetic waves or radio frequency emissions
in excess of the FCC standards. (Ord. 678 §1, 2003)

collocation, modification, operation,
relocation and removal within the
City’s territorial boundaries,
consistent with and to the extent
permitted under federal and
California state law. The standards
and procedures contained in this
Chapter are intended to, and should
be applied to, consistent with and to
the extent permitted under federal
and California state law, protect and
promote public health, safety and
welfare, and also balance the benefits
that flow from robust, advanced
wireless services with the City’s
local values, which include without
limitation the aesthetic character of
the City, its neighborhoods and
community. This chapter is also
intended to reflect and promote the
community interest by (1) ensuring
that the balance between public and
private interest is maintained on a
case-by-case basis; (2) protecting the
City’s visual character from potential
adverse impacts or visual blight
created or exacerbated by wireless
communications infrastructure; (3)
protecting and preserving the City’s
environmental resources; and (4)
promoting access to high-quality,
advanced wireless services for the
City’s residents, businesses and
visitors.
B. This chapter is not intended to, nor
shall it be interpreted or applied to:
(1) prohibit or effectively prohibit
any personal wireless service
provider’s ability to provide personal
wireless services; (2) prohibit or
effectively prohibit any entity’s
ability to provide any interstate or
intrastate telecommunications
service, subject to any competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory rules,
regulations or other legal
requirements for rights-of-way
management; (3) unreasonably
discriminate among providers of
functionally equivalent services; (4)
deny any request for authorization to
place, construct or modify personal
wireless service facilities on the
basis of environmental effects of
radio frequency emissions to the
extent that such wireless facilities
comply with the FCC’s regulations
16.91.020
(03/19)
370-2
concerning such emissions; (5)
prohibit any collocation or
modification that the City may not
deny under federal or California state
law; (6) impose any unfair,
unreasonable, discriminatory or
anticompetitive fees that exceed the
reasonable cost to provide the
services for which the fee is charged;
or (7) otherwise authorize the City to
preempt any applicable federal or
California law.
C. This chapter is intended to apply to
small wireless facilities as defined
and consistent with 47 C.F.R.
Section 1.1312(e)(2) as contemplated

rules and regulations must be in
written form and publicly stated to
provide applicants with prior notice.
C. Procedures for a Duly Filed
Application. Any application for a
PWF Use Permit or section 6409
approval will not be considered duly
filed unless submitted in accordance
with the procedures in this section
16.91.060.C.
1. Pre-Submittal Conference.
Before either planning or
building application submittal,
and unless waived by the
Community Development
Director, the applicant must
schedule and attend a presubmittal
conference with the
16.91.060
(03/19)
370-6
Community Development
Director for all proposed projects
that: (1) require Planning
Commission approval; (2)
involve more than five wireless
facilities in the public right-ofway;
(3) involve any wireless
facilities proposed to be located
in the public rights-of-way in or
within 250 feet from a residential
district; or (4) involve a Section
6409 collocation, modification or
other change to an existing
camouflaged or concealed
facility. Pre-submittal
conferences for all other
proposed projects are strongly
encouraged but not required.
The pre-submittal conference is
intended to streamline the review
process through informal
discussion that includes, without
limitation, the appropriate project
classification and review process,
any latent issues in connection
with the proposed or existing
wireless tower or base station,
including compliance with
generally applicable rules for
public health and safety;
potential concealment issues or
concerns (if applicable);
coordination with other City
departments responsible for
application review; and
application completeness issues.
To mitigate unnecessary delays
due to application
incompleteness, applicants are
encouraged (but not required) to
bring any draft applications or
other materials so that City staff
may provide informal feedback
and guidance about whether such
applications or other materials
may be incomplete or
unacceptable. The Planning
Division shall use reasonable
efforts to provide the applicant
with an appointment within five
working days after receiving a
written request and any
applicable fee or deposit to
reimburse the City for its
reasonable costs to provide the
services rendered in the presubmittal
conference.
2. Submittal Appointment. Unless
waived by the Community
Development Director, all
applications must be submitted to
the City at a pre-scheduled
appointment with the
Community Development
Director. Applicants may
generally submit one application
per appointment, but may
schedule successive
appointments for multiple
applications whenever feasible
and not prejudicial to other
applicants. The Community
Development Director shall use
reasonable efforts to provide the
applicant with an appointment
within five working days after
the Community Development
Director receives a written
request and, if applicable,
confirms that the applicant
complied with the pre-submittal
conference requirement. Any
application received without an
appointment, whether delivered
in person, by mail or through any
other means, will not be
considered duly filed unless the
applicant received a written
exemption from the Community
Development Director at a presubmittal
conference.
16.91.060
(03/19)
370-7
D. Applications Deemed Withdrawn.
To promote efficient review and
timely decisions, any application
governed under this chapter will be
automatically deemed withdrawn by
the applicant when the applicant fails
to tender a substantive response to
the Planning Division within 90
calendar days after the Community
Development Director deems the
application incomplete in a written
notice to the applicant. The
Community Development Director
may, in the Community
Development Director’s discretion,
grant a written extension for up to an
additional 30 calendar days when the
applicant submits a written request
prior to the 90th day that shows good
cause to grant the extension. Delays
due to circumstances outside the
applicant’s reasonable control will be
considered good cause to grant the
extension.
E. Peer and Independent Consultant
Review. The City Council authorizes
the Community Development
Director to, in the Community
Development Director’s discretion,
select and retain an independent
consultant with specialized training,
experience and/or expertise in
telecommunications issues
satisfactory to the Community
Development Director in connection
any permit application. The
Community Development Director
may request an independent
consultant review on any issue that
involves specialized or expert
knowledge in connection with
wireless facilities deployment or
permit applications for wireless
facilities, which include without
limitation:
1. permit application completeness
and/or accuracy
2. pre-construction planned
compliance with applicable
regulations for human exposure
to RF emissions
3. post-construction actual
compliance with applicable
regulations for human exposure
to RF emissions
4. whether and to what extent a
proposed project will address a
gap in the applicant’s wireless
services
5. whether and to what extent any
technically feasible and/ or
potentially available alternative
sites or concealment techniques
may exist
6. the applicability, reliability and/
or sufficiency of any
information, analyses or
methodologies used by the
applicant to reach any
conclusions about any issue with
the City’s discretion to review
7. any other issue identified by the
Community Development
Director that requires expert or
specialized knowledge.
The Community Development Director may
request that the independent consultant
prepare written reports, testify at public
meetings, hearings and/ or appeals and
attend meetings with City staff and/ or the
applicant. In the event that the Community
Development Director elects to retain an
independent consultant in connection with
any permit application, the applicant shall be
responsible for the reasonable costs in
connection with the services provided,
which may include without limitation any
costs incurred by the independent consultant
to attend and participate in any meetings or
hearings. Before the independent consultant
16.91.070
(03/19)
370-8
may perform any services, the applicant
shall tender to the City a deposit in an
amount equal to the estimated cost for the
services to be provided, as determined by
the Community Development Director. The
Community Development Director may
request additional deposits as reasonably
necessary to ensure sufficient funds are
available to cover the reasonable costs in
connection with the independent
consultant’s services. In the event that the
deposit exceeds the total costs for
consultant’s services, the Community
Development Director shall promptly return
any unused funds to the applicant after the
wireless facility has been installed and
passes a final inspection by the Building
Official or his or her designee. In the event
that the reasonable costs for the independent
consultant’s services exceed the deposit, the
Community Development Director shall
invoice the applicant for the balance. The
City shall not issue any construction or
grading permit to any applicant with any
unpaid deposit requests or invoices.
16.91.070 Development Standards
A. Preferred Locations. When
evaluating an application for a PWF
Use Permit for compliance with this
chapter, the approval authority will
take into account whether any or
more preferred locations are
technically feasible and potentially
available. Any locations within any
residential zoning district, locations
within 500 feet from a public or
private school or residential
dwelling, attached to a decorative
light standard or otherwise not listed
below in this section 16.91.070 shall
be considered “discouraged.” All
applicants for a PWF Use Permit
must propose new wireless facilities
in locations according to the
following preferences, ordered from
most preferred to least preferred:
1. private property and existing or
replacement structures in the
public rights-of-way outside any
residential zoning district and not
within 500 feet from any public
or private school or residential
dwelling;
2. private property and existing or
replacement structures in the
public rights-of-way within
general open space districts and
not within 500 feet from any
public or private school or
residential dwelling;
3. private property and existing or
replacement structures in the
public rights-of-way within
public and semi-public districts
and not within 500 feet from any
public or private school or
residential dwelling;
4. new, non-replacement structures
in the public rights-of-way
outside any residential zoning
district and not within 500 feet
from any public or private school
or residential dwelling;
5. new, non-replacement structures
in the public rights-of-way within
general open space districts and
not within 500 feet from any
public or private school or
residential dwelling; and
6. new, non-replacement structures
in the public rights-of-way within
public and semi-public districts
and not within 500 feet from any
public or private school or
residential dwelling.
7. existing or replacement
structures in the public rights-ofway
and major arterial streets not
within 125 feet of a residential
16.91.070
(03/19)
370-9
dwelling;
8. new, non-replacement structures
in the public rights-of-way on
major arterial streets not within
125 feet of a residential dwelling.
B. General Development Standards.
All new wireless facilities and
collocations, modifications or other
changes to existing wireless facilities
that require a PWF Use Permit under
this chapter must conform to the
generally applicable development
standards in this section 16.91.7.b.
1. Concealment. All wireless
facilities must be concealed to
the maximum extent feasible
with design elements and
techniques that mimic or blend
with the underlying support
structure, surrounding
environment and adjacent uses.
In addition, wireless facilities in
the public rights-of-way may not
unreasonably subject the public
use, for any purpose including
expressive or aesthetic purposes,
to inconvenience, discomfort,
trouble, annoyance, hindrance,
impediment or obstruction.
2. Overall Height. All wireless
facilities must be compliant with
the maximum height limits
applicable in the subject land use
district; provided, however, that
(1) completely stealth wireless
facilities on private property in a
preferred location may exceed
the maximum height limit by not
more than 10 feet; (2) concealed
wireless facilities in the public
rights-of-way on poles with
electrical lines may exceed the
maximum height limit by not
more than the minimum
separation from electrical lines
required by CPUC General Order
95, plus four feet; and (3)
concealed wireless facilities in
the public rights-of-way on poles
without electrical lines may
exceed the maximum height limit
by not more than four feet.
3. Setbacks. Wireless facilities on
private property must be
compliant with all setback
requirements applicable in the
subject land use district.
4. Noise. Wireless facilities and all
transmission equipment must
comply with all noise regulations
and shall not exceed, either
individually or cumulatively,
such regulations. The approval
authority may require the
applicant to incorporate
appropriate noise-baffling
materials and/or strategies to
avoid any ambient noise from
equipment reasonably likely to
exceed the applicable noise
regulations.
5. Landscaping. All wireless
facilities must include landscape
features and a landscape
maintenance plan when proposed
to be placed in a landscaped area.
The approval authority may
require additional landscape
features to screen the wireless
facility from public view, avoid
or mitigate potential adverse
impacts on adjacent properties or
otherwise enhance the
concealment required under this
section. All plants proposed or
required must be native and/or
drought-resistant.
6. Site Security Measures. Wireless
facilities may incorporate
reasonable and appropriate site
security measures, such as locks
and anti-climbing devices, to
16.91.070
(03/19)
370-10
prevent unauthorized access,
theft or vandalism. All wireless
facilities shall be constructed
from graffiti-resistant materials.
The approval authority may
require additional concealment
elements as the approval
authority finds necessary to blend
the security measures and other
improvements into the natural
and/ or built environment. The
approval authority shall not
approve barbed wire, razor
ribbon, electrified fences or any
similar security measures.
7. Backup Power Sources. The
approval authority may not
approve permanent backup
power sources within the public
rights-of-way that emit noise or
exhaust fumes.
8. Lights. Wireless facilities may
not include exterior lights other
than as may be required under
FAA, FCC, other applicable
governmental regulations or
applicable pole owner policies
related to public or worker
safety. All exterior lights
permitted or required to be
installed must be installed in
locations and within enclosures
that mitigates illumination
impacts on other properties to the
maximum extent feasible. Any
lights associated with the
electronic equipment shall be
appropriately shielded from
public view. The provisions in
this subsection shall not be
interpreted to prohibit
installations on street lights or
the installation of luminaires on
new poles when required by the
approval authority.
9. Signage; Advertisements. All
wireless facilities must include
signage that accurately identifies
the equipment owner/operator,
the wireless facilities specific
identification number, the
owner/operator’s site name or
identification number and a tollfree
number to the
owner/operator’s network
operations center. Wireless
facilities may not bear any other
signage or advertisements unless
expressly approved by the City,
required by law or recommended
under FCC or other United States
governmental agencies for
compliance with RF emissions
regulations.
10. Future Collocations and
Expansions. To the extent
feasible and aesthetically
desirable, all new wireless
facilities should be designed and
sited in a manner that
accommodates potential future
collocations and equipment
installations that can be
integrated into the proposed
wireless facility or its associated
structures with no or negligible
visual changes to the outward
appearance. The approval
authority may waive the
requirements in this section
16.91.070.B.10 when the
approval authority determines
future collocations at a proposed
wireless facility would be
aesthetically undesirable.
11. Utilities. All cables and
connectors for telephone,
primary electric and other similar
utilities must be routed
underground to the extent
feasible in conduits large enough
to accommodate future
16.91.070
(03/19)
370-11
collocated wireless facilities. To
the extent feasible,
undergrounded cables and wires
must transition directly into the
pole base without any external
doghouse. Meters, panels,
disconnect switches and other
associated improvements must be
placed in inconspicuous locations
to the extent possible. The
approval authority shall not
approve new overhead utility
lines or service drops merely
because compliance with the
undergrounding requirements
would increase the project cost.
Microwave or other wireless
backhaul is discouraged when it
would involve a separate and
unconcealed antenna.
12. Compliance with Laws. All
wireless facilities must be
designed and sited in compliance
with all applicable federal, state
and local laws, regulations, rules,
restrictions and conditions, which
includes without limitation the
California Building Standards
Code, Americans with
Disabilities Act, General Plan
and any applicable specific plan,
the Ripon Municipal Code and
any conditions or restrictions in
any permit or other governmental
approval issued by any public
agency with jurisdiction over the
project.
13. Public Utility Consent. Any
wireless facilities placed on poles
or structures owned by any
public utility, including but not
limited to Pacific Gas &
Electricity, Modesto Irrigation
District or South San Joaquin
Irrigation District, shall require
the written consent of such
public utility and compliance
with any terms and conditions
imposed by said public utility.
14. Public Safety. All wireless
facilities shall not interfere with
access to a fire hydrant, fire
station, fire escape, water valve,
underground vault, valve housing
structure or any other public
health or safety facility. No
person shall install, use or
maintain any facilities, which in
whole or in part rest upon, in or
over any public right-of-way,
when such installation, use or
maintenance endangers or is
reasonably likely to endanger the
safety of persons or property, or
when such site or location is used
for public utility purposes, public
transportation purposes or other
governmental use, or when such
facilities unreasonably interfere
with or unreasonably impede the
flow of pedestrian or vehicular
traffic including any legally
parked or stopped vehicle, the
ingress into or egress from any
residence or place of business,
the use of poles, posts, traffic
signs or signals, hydrants,
mailboxes, permitted sidewalk
dining, permitted street furniture
or other objects permitted at or
near the location where the
wireless facilities are located.
C. Design Guidelines. The Community
Development Department shall
develop design guidelines consistent
with the generally applicable design
regulations to clarify the aesthetic
and public safety goals and standards
in this chapter for City staff,
applicants and the public. The design
guidelines shall provide more
detailed standards to implement the
16.91.080
(03/19)
370-12
general principals articulated in this
section 16.91.070, and may include
specific standards for particular
wireless facilities or site locations,
but shall not unreasonably
discriminate between functionally
equivalent service providers. The
design guidelines, and any
subsequent amendments, shall not be
effective unless approved by a
resolution adopted by the City
Council
16.91.080 Notices
A. General Notice Requirements.
Except as provided in section
16.91.080.B, public notice in
accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Ripon Municipal
Code shall be given for all
applications for a PWF Use Permit
governed under this chapter.
B. Deemed-Approval Notice. Not more
than 30 days before the applicable
shot clock expires, and in addition to
any public notice required prior to a
decision, an applicant for a PWF Use
Permit must provide a posted notice
at the project site [each pole where
tower attached - may want to clarify]
that contains (1) a statement the
project will be automatically deemed
approved pursuant to California
Government Code § 65964.1 unless
the City approves or denies the
application or the applicant
voluntarily agrees to toll the
timeframe for review within the next
30 days; (2) a general description for
the proposed project; (3) the
applicant’s name and contact
information as provided on the
application submitted to the City;
and (4) contact information for the
Community Development
Department. The public notice
required under this section
16.91.080.B will be deemed given
when the applicant delivers written
notice to the Community
Development Department that shows
the appropriate notice has been
posted on each pole at the project
site. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this chapter, the
approval authority shall be permitted
to act on an application for a PWF
Use Permit at any time so long as
any applicable prior public notice in
this section 16.91.080 has occurred.
C. Decision Notice. Within five
calendar days after the approval
authority acts on a PWF Use Permit
application governed under this
chapter or before the shot clock
expires (whichever occurs first), the
approval authority or its designee
shall send a written notice to the
applicant. In the event that the
approval authority denies the
application (with or without
prejudice), the written notice to the
applicant shall contain (1) the
reasons for the decision and (2)
instructions for how and when to file
an appeal.
16.91.090 Decisions and Appeals
A. Required Findings. The approval
authority may approve or
conditionally approve an application
for a PWF Use Permit submitted
under this chapter when the approval
authority finds all of the following:
1. the approval authority can make
all the findings required for a Use
Permit in accordance with Ripon
Municipal Code § 16.76.070; and
2. the proposed wireless facility
complies with all applicable
development standards in section
16.91.070 and any applicable
16.91.090
(03/19)
370-13
provisions in the City’s design
guidelines; and
3. the applicant has demonstrated
that its proposed wireless facility
will be in compliance with all
applicable FCC regulations and
guidelines for human exposure to
RF emissions; and
4. the applicant has proposed to
place the wireless facility in the
most preferred location or, if the
wireless facility is not proposed
in the most preferred location,
the applicant has demonstrated a
good-faith effort to identify and
evaluate more-preferred
alternative locations through a
meaningful comparative analysis;
and
5. the applicant has provided the
approval authority with a
meaningful comparative analysis
that shows all more-preferred
alternative designs identified in
the administrative record are
either technically infeasible or
unavailable.
B. Conditional Approvals; Denials
without Prejudice. Subject to any
applicable federal or California laws,
nothing in this chapter is intended to
limit the approval authority’s ability
to conditionally approve or deny
without prejudice any PWF Use
Permit application governed under
this chapter as may be necessary or
appropriate to protect and promote
the public health, safety and welfare,
and to advance the goals or policies
in the General Plan and any specific
plan, the Ripon Municipal Code and/
or this chapter.
C. Limited Exception. In the event that
an applicant claims that strict
compliance with the development
standards in section 16.91.070 would
effectively prohibit the applicant’s
ability to provide personal wireless
services, the Planning Commission
may grant a limited exception from
such requirements in accordance
with this section 16.91.090.C.
1. Required Findings for a Limited
Exception. The Planning
Commission shall not grant any
limited exception unless the
applicant shows that:
a. the proposed wireless facility
qualifies as a “personal
wireless service facility” as
defined in 47 U.S.C. §
332(c)(7)(C)(ii), as may be
amended or superseded;
b. the applicant has provided the
Planning Commission with a
reasonable and clearly
defined technical service
objective to be achieved by
the proposed wireless
facility;
c. the applicant has provided the
Planning Commission with a
written statement that
contains a detailed and factspecific
explanation as to
why the proposed wireless
facility cannot be deployed in
compliance with the
applicable provisions in this
chapter;
d. the applicant has provided the
Planning Commission with a
meaningful comparative
analysis with the factual
reasons why all alternative
locations and/ or designs
identified in the
administrative record
(whether suggested by the
applicant, the City, public
comments or any other
source) are not technically
16.91.090
(03/19)
370-14
feasible or potentially
available to reasonably
achieve the applicant’s
reasonable and clearly
defined technical service
objective to be achieved by
the proposed wireless
facility; and
e. the applicant has
demonstrated to the Planning
Commission that the
proposed location and design
is the least noncompliant
configuration that will
reasonably achieve the
applicant’s reasonable and
clearly defined technical
service objective to be
achieved by the proposed
wireless facility, which
includes without limitation a
meaningful comparative
analysis into multiple smaller
or less intrusive wireless
facilities dispersed
throughout the intended
service area.
2. Scope. Any limited exception
shall be narrowly tailored to
ensure that any deviations from
the development standards in
section 16.91.070 are no greater
than necessary to avoid an
effective prohibition of the
applicant’s personal wireless
services. Limited exceptions
shall be based on the facts and
circumstances of the applicant,
its demonstrated technical
service objectives at the time the
exception is granted and the
proposed wireless facility, and
shall not be deemed to establish
any precedent for similar
deviations for the same or any
other applicant, location or
wireless facility.
D. Appeals. Within ten (10) days after
the approval authority approves or
denies any application for a PWF
Use Permit, any interested person
may file an appeal for cause in
accordance with the provisions in
Ripon Municipal Code §16.08.060;
provided, however, that appeals from
an approval shall not be permitted
when based solely on the
environmental effects from radio
frequency emissions that are
compliant with applicable FCC
regulations and guidelines.
16.91.100 Standard Conditions
A. Conditions Adopted by City Council
Resolution. The City Council may,
either on its own motion or upon a
recommendation from the
Community Development Director,
adopt by resolution standard
conditions of approval for wireless
facilities subject to this chapter. All
wireless facilities, whether approved
by the approval authority or deemed
approved or deemed granted by law
shall be automatically subject to all
such standard conditions of approval
as may be adopted in a resolution by
the City Council.
B. Modifications to Standard
Conditions. The approval authority
(or the appellate authority) shall have
discretion to modify or amend any
standard conditions of approval on a
case-by-case basis as may be
necessary or appropriate to protect
and promote the public health, safety
and welfare, allow for the proper
operation of the approved wireless
facility, maintain compliance with
applicable laws and/ or to advance
the goals or policies in the General
Plan and any specific plan, the Ripon

16.110.010 Purpose.
It is the intent of this chapter to prevent
community wide adverse economic impacts,
increased crime, decreased property values, and the
deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought
about by the concentration of Adult-Oriented
Businesses in close proximity to each other or
proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools
for minors, churches, and residentially zoned
districts or uses. The City Council finds that it has
been demonstrated in various communities that the
concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses causes
an increase in the number of transients in the area,
and an increase in crime, and in addition to the
effects described above can cause other businesses
and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the
purpose of this chapter to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of
Adult-Oriented Businesses or their close proximity
to incompatible uses, while permitting the location
of Adult-Oriented Businesses in certain areas. (Ord.

16.116.020 Requirements for Application.
An application for a Certificate of Compliance
may be initiated by the property owner(s) or
vendee of such person pursuant to a contract of
sale of such property. Applications are filed with
the Planning Department. An application for
Certificates of Compliance must include a site plan
and any other maps or documents required by the
City. A fee, as specified by resolution of the City
Council, is required with the application. (Ord.
606, 1999)

Requirements for Issuance.
The Director shall review the Certificate of
Compliance and make one of the following
determinations based on that review:
A. Issuance. If the parcel is found to comply
with all provisions of the Subdivision Map Act
and the City Municipal Code, a Certificate of
Compliance shall be issued pursuant Government
Code; or
B. Conditional Issuance. If the parcel does
not comply with regulations in effect at the time of
its creation or does not comply with current
regulations, the parcel shall be found not to
comply with State or City regulations. A
conditional Certificate of Compliance that states
the conditions required to bring the parcel into
compliance shall be issued, pursuant to the
Government Code. Only conditions that would
have been applicable at the time the applicant
acquired interest in the property may be imposed.
Conditions may not exceed the requirements at the
time the parcel was created. However, if an
applicant was the owner of record at the time of
the initial violation of the Subdivision Map Act or
of local ordinances enacted pursuant to the Act,
conditions may be imposed that are applicable to a
current division of property. Fulfillment of all
conditions shall be required before subsequent
issuance of any permit or grant of approval for
development of property. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord.

flush with the finished grade.
B. Alternative Locations. In the event that, due
to the construction of subdivisions improvements or
the location of trees or other physical features, the
monuments specified above cannot be located at the
points specified, a reference monument or
monuments must be set subject to the approval of
the City Engineer. Notes as to the location of the
monument or monuments with reference to the
referenced points must be furnished to the City
Engineer. (Ord. 606, 1999)

report, prepared by a state-registered civil engineer
and based upon adequate test borings, shall be
submitted to the building official for every Major
Subdivision at the time of tentative map submittal.
B. Waiver of Report. A preliminary soils report
may be waived if the city engineer or building
official finds that, due to the knowledge the City
possesses relative to the quality of the soils in this
subdivision, no preliminary analysis is necessary.
C. Soils Investigation. If the required
preliminary soils report indicates the presence of
critically expansive soils or other soil problems
which, if not corrected, would lead to structural
defects, the Subdivider must provide for and submit
the findings of a soil investigation of each lot in the
subdivision. The soil investigation must be prepared
by a state-registered civil engineer and shall
recommend corrective action likely to prevent
structural damage to each dwelling to be

for every major subdivision at the time of tentative
map submittal. The preliminary geotechnical report
shall include estimates of expected peak ground
accelerations during maximum credible earthquake
potentially affecting the site.
B. Waiver of Report. A preliminary
geotechnical report may be waived if the building
official finds that, due to the knowledge the City
possesses relative to the quality of the soils in this
subdivision, no preliminary analysis is necessary.
C. Geotechnical Investigation. If the required
preliminary geotechnical report indicates the
presence of geologic hazards (such as slope
instability, subsidence, adverse soil conditions,
seismic hazards) which, if not corrected, would lead
to structural defects, the Subdivider shall provide for
and submit the findings of a geotechnical
investigation for each lot in the subdivision. The
geotechnical investigation shall be prepared by a
state-registered geotechnical engineer or
state-registered geologist and shall recommend
corrective action likely to prevent structural damage
to each dwelling to be constructed. Prior to issuance
of the building permit, any recommended action
398 (8/07)
16.124.130
approved by the building official shall be
incorporated into site preparation and construction of
each dwelling. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §2 (part),
2007)

subsurface contamination report may be waived if
the City Council finds that, due to the knowledge the
City possesses relative to the possible contamination
of soils in this subdivision, no preliminary analysis
is necessary. A recommendation from the DRC
(Development Review Committee) shall accompany
the waiver request.
C. Corrective Action. If the report indicates
there are surface and subsurface contamination,
corrective action must be taken, as recommended in
the report and concurred with the San Joaquin
County Public Health Services Environmental
Health Division prior to issuance of the building
permit. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §2 (part), 2007)
16.124.150 Resubdivision
In the event an existing subdivision is
resubdivided such that the street alignment, lot
design or drainage shall be changed, then the area
constitutes a new subdivision and the procedures for
filing a tentative and final map as outlined in this
chapter apply. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.124.160 Subdivisions Adjacent to Major
Streets.
When a subdivision is developed bordering a
freeway, expressway or major street as shown on the
General Plan, the City may, in its discretion, require
the developer to dedicate and improve a frontage
road, open-ended cul-de-sacs, or circular driveways
to provide access to adjacent lots. Access may also
be provided by the use of varied lot sizes and
setbacks or any other method acceptable to the
Planning Commission. Reciprocal easements to limit
access may be used for commercial and professional
office uses. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §2 (part),

for its consideration and determination as to whether
the proposed tentative map shall be accepted by the
Planning Commission for review. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.124.190 Division of Existing Buildings.
Prior to the recording of a Final or Parcel Map
which will result in the division of any existing
building or buildings into separate units or parts, the
Subdivider shall secure certification by the Chief
Building Official that any building or buildings to be
divided will, after division, meet current code
standards for new construction. As used in this
Section, the phrase current code standards refers to
all standards in the current editions of the Building
Code, Electrical Code, Plumbing Code, Mechanical
Code and Fire Code of the City. (Ord. 606, 1999)
399 (8/07)
16.124.200
16.124.200 Improvement Agreement and
Securities.
A. Prior to the approval by the City Council of
a Parcel or Final Map, the Subdivider shall execute
an agreement between himself/herself and the City,
specifying the period within which he/she shall
complete all improvement work to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer, and providing that if he/she shall
fail to complete such work within such period, the
City may complete the same and recover the full
cost and expense thereof from the Subdivider. The
agreement shall also provide for inspection of all
improvements by the City Engineer, and
reimbursement of the City by the Subdivider for the
cost of such inspection.
1. Such agreement may also provide:
a. For the construction of the improvement in
units;
b. For extension of time under conditions
therein specified;
c. For partial release of the improvement
securities upon the acceptance by the City council of
the work as it progresses;
d. For the financing and construction of any or
all of such improvements under an appropriate
special assessment act proceeding, the Subdivider
shall agree, in writing, to initiate, and so far as may
be in his/her power, to consummate such
proceedings, within such time as may be prescribed
by the City Council;
e. Any other fees required by the City.
B. The Subdivider shall also file with the
agreement two (2) improvement securities, each to
be in an amount based upon the total estimated cost
of the improvements as determined by the City
Engineer. One (1) improvement security shall
secure faithful performance of the agreement and
shall be in an amount equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of the estimated cost of the improvements.
The second improvement security shall secure the
obligations set forth in Section 66499.2 of the
Government Code, for payment of the contractor,
his/her subcontractor(s) and to persons renting
equipment or furnishing labor or materials to them
for the improvements, and shall be in an amount
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the total
estimated cost of the improvements. Such
improvement securities shall be in one of the
following forms:
1. A cash deposit or deposits;
2. A bond or bonds issued by one or more duly
authorized corporate sureties;
3. An instrument or instruments of credit from
one or more financial institutions subject to
regulations by the State or Federal government
pledging that the funds necessary to meet the
performance are on deposit and guaranteed for
payments and agreeing that the funds designated by
the instrument shall become trust funds for the
purposes set forth in the instrument;
4. Any other form of improvement security
authorized by the Subdivision Map Act and
acceptable to the City Attorney, including the
deposit, with a responsible escrow agent or trust
company approved by the City Council, or money or
negotiable bonds of the kind approved for securing
deposits of public money.
C. The required security shall be an amount
determined by the City Engineer as sufficient to
cover the cost of the improvements, engineering,
inspection, fees and incidental expenses. The
required improvement security shall be approved by
the City Administrator as to sufficiency and by the
City Attorney as to form.
D. In the event the Subdivider shall fail to
complete all improvement work in accordance with
the provisions of this Chapter and the City shall have
to complete the same, or if the Subdivider shall fail
to reimburse the City for the cost of inspection,
engineering, fees and incidental expenses, the City
shall call on the surety for reimbursement, or shall
appropriate from any cash deposits, or instruments
of credit, funds for reimbursement. In any case, if
the amount of the surety bond, instrument of credit,
or cash in deposit shall exceed all cost and expenses
incurred by the City, it shall release the remainder of
400 (8/07)
16.124.200
such bond, instrument of credit or cash deposit. If
the amount of surety bond, instrument of credit or
cash deposit shall be less than the cost and expense
incurred by the City, the Subdivider shall be liable to
the City for such difference.
E. Improvement securities may be released or
reduced, in whole or in part, only in the time and
manner prescribed in Section 66499.7 of the
Government Code, as it now exists or is hereafter
amended, and only after certification by the City
Engineer that the work covered thereby has been
satisfactorily complete and upon approval of the
City Council.
F. In addition to the improvement securities
specified above, a one (1) year maintenance
guarantee is required to repair any defective work or
labor done, or defective materials furnished during
construction of the improvements. Once the City
Engineer has determined that the improvements
were completed in substantial compliance with the
plans and specifications, the City Engineer will
recommend that the City Council accept the
improvements. Prior to this recommendation, the
Subdivider shall deliver to the City Engineer a one
(1) year maintenance guarantee in the amount
specified in the Subdivision Improvement
Agreement, and in a form so stated in the agreement.

requirements for parcel maps. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.132.020 Parcel Map Required.
The filing of a parcel map, in conformance with
the tentative map or vesting tentative map of an
approved Minor Subdivision Application, shall be a
condition of approval of any Minor Subdivision
Application. (Ord. 606, 1999)
16.132.030 Preparation.
The parcel map shall be prepared by, or under
the direction of, a registered civil engineer, duly
licensed to practice land surveying, or a licensed
land surveyor; shall show the location of streets and
property lines bounding the property; shall conform
to all of the following provisions:
A. Legibility. It shall be legibly drawn,
printed, or reproduced by a process guaranteeing a
permanent record in black on tracing cloth or
polyester base film. Certificates, statements,
affidavits, and acknowledgments may be legibly
stamped or printed upon the map with opaque ink.
If ink is used on polyester base film, the ink surface
shall be coated with a suitable substance to assure
permanent legibility.
B. Size and Scale. The size of each sheet shall
be eighteen (18) by twenty-six (26) inches. A
marginal line shall be drawn completely around each
sheet, leaving an entirely blank margin of one inch.
The scale of the map shall be large enough to show
all details clearly, and enough sheets shall be used to
accomplish this end. The particular number of each
sheet and the total number of sheets composing the
map shall be stated on each of the sheets, and the
relation of each adjoining sheet shall be clearly
shown. Each sheet and the lettering thereon shall be
so oriented that, with the north arrow directed away

identified as follows:
1. The exterior gross boundary of the land
included within the subdivision shall be indicated by
an extra heavy line and clearly designated.
2. The map shall show the location of each
parcel and its relation to surrounding surveys. If the
map includes a "designated remainder" parcel or
similar parcel, and the gross area of the "designated
remainder" parcel or similar parcel is five (5) acres
or more, that remainder parcel need not be shown on
the map, and its location need not be indicated as a
matter of survey but only by deed reference to the
existing boundaries of the remainder parcel.
3. A parcel designated as "not a part" shall be
deemed to be a "designated remainder" for purposes
of this Section.
E. Statement of Consent. Subject to the
provisions of Section 66436 of the Subdivision Map
407 Ripon (8-07)
16.132.030

parties having any record title interest in the real
property subdivided, consenting to the preparation
and filing of the parcel map is required.
F. Consent of Subdivider. Where dedications
or offers of dedications are not required, the
statement shall be signed and acknowledged by the
subdivider only. If the subdivider does not have a
record title ownership interest in the property to be
divided, the subdivider shall provide the City with
satisfactory evidence that the persons with record
title ownership have consented to the proposed
division. For purposes of this Subsection, "record
title ownership" shall mean fee title of record unless
a leasehold interest is to be divided, in which case
"record title ownership" shall mean ownership of
record of the leasehold interest. "Record title
ownership" does not include ownership of mineral
rights or other subsurface interests that have been
severed from ownership of the surface. Statements
and acknowledgments required by this Subsection
shall be recorded concurrently with the parcel map
being filed for record.

Standards
16.142.010 Purpose
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to
establish minimum standards for public and private
streets constructed or improved in the City of Ripon.
This chapter sets forth the minimum standards for
improvements within the right-of-way, including but
not limited to street material, curb and gutter,
sidewalk improvements, landscaping, acoustic walls,
and right-of-way dedication for the development or
improvement of property abutting City streets.
(Ord. 824 §1, 2015)
16.142.020 Authority
All design and construction of public and private
streets addressed by this chapter will be in
accordance with the City of Ripon’s Standard
Specifications and Standard Details, the City of
Ripon’s Master Circulation System, the City of
Ripon’s General Plan Circulation and Transportation
Element and as defined in this chapter. The City
Engineer and/or designee is responsible for
maintaining appropriate policies and procedures for
the implementation of the City’s Master Circulation
System. Unless specified elsewhere, the City
Engineer and/or designee is responsible for
administering and interpreting the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 824 §1, 2015)
16.142.030 Public Roadway Functional
Classifications
A. Purpose. The purpose of a system of
functional classifications and street types is to
facilitate the safe and efficient movement of people
and goods while preserving residential areas and
maintaining the economic vitality of commercial and
industrial areas. The system classifies transportation
facilities according to an appropriately integrated
network, emphazing the movement of all modes of
transportation through a network of streets in a safe,
logical and efficient manner. The classification
system organizes streets according to the land-use
designations they serve (or are intended to serve) and
is based on a number of features including existing
and projected traffic volumes, expected growth
based on land-use patterns, the nature of vehicle
traffic, and present and future connectivity and
circulation needs. The system is also intended to
link land use development activities with
transportation facilities for the optimum utilization of
both. Existing and proposed expressways, arterials
and collectors are shown on the City of Ripon’s
adopted Master Circulation System.
B. Functional Classifications and Street Types.
Subsections 1-7 below provide a broad general
description of the purpose and function of street
types. Required design specifications for each street
type are set forth in Table 16.142.040 and in later
sections of this chapter for each street type.
1. Expressway - These streets are designed as
high capacity, high-speed corridors with the primary
purpose of improving local and regional mobility.
Expressways should meet the following criteria:
a. Multi-lane facilities including center
medians.
b. Provide limited access from abutting
properties and intersections that are
generally located no less than ½ mile
intervals.
c. Right-in/right-out movements may be more
frequently allowed but may also involve
acceleration and deceleration lanes.
d. Have a minimum design speed of 45 mph.
e. Turn lanes included at intersections.
414-1
16.142.030
f. Preference for traffic signals at major
intersections, and may include roundabouts
where appropriate.
2. Major Arterial - These streets are designed
primarily to carry a heavier traffic pattern providing
continuity throughout the contiguous urban area.
Access control is typically maintained towards
limiting access to intersections with other roads, or
right-in/right-out movements.
3. Minor Arterial - These streets are designed to
collect and distribute traffic from major arterials to
streets of lower classifications and may allow traffic
to access destinations directly. Minor arterials serve
through traffic and provide direct access to large
commercial, industrial, office, and some residential
areas.
4. Collector - These streets are primarily
designed to provide land access and circulation
within and between residential neighborhoods and
commercial and industrial areas. Collector streets
are meant to convey traffic from local streets to
minor and major arterials, as well as expressways
and freeway. Even though this street may carry
some through traffic, its primary function is to feed
traffic to the arterial streets and to provide local
access.
5. Local - These streets provide direct access to
adjoining properties within a neighborhood. These
streets connect local streets within a neighborhood to
Collector streets and to the Arterial street network.
Through trips are discouraged and parking is
allowed.
6. Cul-de-Sacs - These streets are a maximum of
500 feet long and parking is allowed.
7. Alleys - These secondary accesses to the back
sides of lots allow the streets at th fronts of
properties to remain unencumbered with driveways.
Alleys are an alternative to frontage access.

16.142.040 General Street Design Standards
A. All streets shall be constructed in accordance
with City of Ripon’s Standard Specifications and
Standard Details and are to include Concrete Pavers
pursuant to City of Ripon Standard Detail ST-8A
unless approved otherwise by the City Engineer.
B. Acoustic/Sound Walls and /or continuous
residential fencing are prohibited along street rightsof-
ways unless approved otherwise by the City
Engineer and/or Planning Director. Use of walls
along street corridors will only be considered in very
limited and/or extreme circumstances.
C. Minor Arterials and Collector Streets through
residential neighborhoods shall be designed to the
extent possible using curvilinear designs to calm
traffic and enhance aesthetic appeal within a
residential neighborhood.
D. When residential properties front a 2-lane
minor arterial, the residential units shall be designed
to discourage the need for backing out of driveways
onto the roadway. This may be accomplished by use
of circular driveways, “hammer head” driveways,
alley loaded residential units, or use of frontage
roads.
E. When residential properties front or are
adjacent to an expressway, major arterial or a 4-lane
minor arterial, the residential units shall be designed
so that no direct vehicular access is allowed onto
those roadways from a residential unit. This may be
accomplished by use of a frontage road or a
landscaped buffer. All residential units adjacent to
those roadways must include either a thirty four (34)
foot wide minimum landscaped buffer or fifty (50)
foot wide minimum frontage road.
F. Expressways, Major and Minor Arterials and
Collector Streets located adjacent to residential areas
should include design elements to buffer sight and
sound impacts on adjoining properties including, but
not limited to, street trees, open spaces, and grade
differentials.
G. Local residential streets shall be designed
with aesthetics of primary concern, subject only to
considerations of function and public safety.
H. Sidewalks - All sidewalks shall be
constructed in accordance with the City of Ripon’s
Standard Specifications and Standard Details unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
I. Private streets shall be constructed in

16.148.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to establish
standards for landscaping and irrigation to protect
the public security and safety, conserve and
protect property, and improve the general
appearance of the City of Ripon. (Ord. 606, 1999;
Ord. 782, 2011; Ord. 793, 2012)
16.148.020 Applicability.
The requirements of this chapter apply to all
new residential, commercial and industrial
projects, multifamily developments, mobile home
parks, and planned developments. (Ord. 606, 1999;
Ord. 782, 2011; Ord. 793, 2012)
16.148.030 Basic Requirements.
Minimum site landscaping and required
planting areas must be installed in accordance
with the standards and requirements of this
section, that apply to all projects that require a
permit.
A. Preparation of Plans. Landscape plans
must be prepared by a landscape designer, a
licensed landscape architect or other qualified
person. The Planning Director and the Public
Works Director may accept plans from an
applicant if the plans meet the requirements of
this Chapter.
B. Timing of Installation. Required
landscaping and irrigation systems must be
completely installed prior to the use of the
property and the issuance of the Certificate of
Occupancy for a new structure.
C. Deferred Agreement. For projects
consisting primarily of additions to or remodeling
of existing buildings for which landscaping is
required, a deferred completion agreement may be
executed prior to issuance of the building permit.
The agreement shall guarantee installation of the
landscape and any irrigation improvements, and
may require the provision of financial assurances,
in the discretion of the City Engineer. (Ord. 606,
1999; Ord. 782, 2011; Ord. 793, 2012)
16.148.040 Standards.
A. Maintenance. Required planting areas
must be permanently maintained. Maintained
includes: watering, weeding, pruning, insect
control, and replacement of plant materials and
irrigation equipment as needed to preserve the
health and appearance of plant materials.
B. Safety. Landscape materials shall not be
located such that, at maturity: they interfere with
safe sight distances for vehicular, bicycle or
pedestrian traffic; they conflict with overhead
utility lines, overhead lights, or walkway lights; or
they block pedestrian or bicycle ways. This safety
requirement shall be defined using the intersection
sight distance section of the latest edition of A
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and
Streets, published by the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials. The
definitions and standards below are meant to
simplify the standards defined in the Policy
manual, however in the event of any conflict
between the two, the Policy manual shall trump.

16.148.040
1. Intersections with stop controls on the
minor road: Any plant material located within the
safe sight distance triangle shall be pruned so that
hedges and the like do not exceed three (3) feet in
height and trees shall be pruned so that there is a
minimum clearance of six (6) feet from the ground
to the nearest branches. The safe sight distance
triangle shall be as defined below.
2. Intersections with traffic signal
control or with all-way stop control are assumed
to have no sight distance criteria issues since the
vehicles on one approach should be visible to the
drivers of the first stopped vehicles in each of the
other approaches.
3. Driveways: Any plant material
located within the safe sight distance triangle shall
be pruned so that hedges and the like do not
exceed three (3) feet in height and trees shall be
pruned so that there is a minimum clearance of six
(6) feet from the ground to the nearest branches.

application for a permit must include plans and
written material describing all existing trees,
including species, height, diameter, and condition,
and showing how any applicable site landscaping
or planting area requirements are to be met. The
degree of specificity of such plans and written
material must relate to the permit or request for
approval being requested.
D. Water Efficient Landscape. All new
landscaping must be planned to create a water
efficient landscape in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 13.06.
1. Plant materials must be selected for:
energy efficiency and drought tolerance;
adaptability and relationship to the Ripon
environment; color, form pattern; ability to
provide shade; soil retention, and fire resistance.

16.172.010 Purpose
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide standards to safeguard life, health, property, and public
welfare in keeping with the character of the city by regulating the size, height, structural design, quality of
materials, construction, location, electrification, illumination and maintenance of all types of signs and
sign structures
The city recognizes the right and need of each individual, business, firm or corporation to identify
his/her place of residence, business or service, and realizes the need to protect public and private investments
in buildings and open space. Therefore, the city has developed sign regulations that will be both
visually and economically effective, while also preventing needless distraction and clutter from excessive
and confusing sign displays.

A-Frame Sign: A temporary, freestanding sign, consisting of two (2) message panels, either attached
by a hinge or similar device along their top edge and placed on the ground with the base of each
panel separated by a sufficient distance to allow the sign to stand upright without other support, or some
variation thereof. For the purposes of this definition, A-frame signs include single message panels that
are mounted on a wood or metal base which provides the stability and support necessary for the sign to

signs may be painted on a wall, or on a board that is attached to a wall. Wall
signs should be oriented to achieve balanced composition and harmony with
other architectural elements of a building façade. Wall signs should be placed on
a flat building surface and should not be placed over or otherwise obscure architectural
building features.

16.172.060 General Sign Design Guidelines
The guidelines in this section address issues related to sign compatibility, legibility, placement, color
and materials, and illumination.
A. Sign Compatibility—Good sign design complements a building’s architecture rather than
detracting from or competing with it. All signs should be compatible with their own and
adjacent buildings. Common indicators of compatibility include:
 Quality sign design and materials. Signs should make a positive contribution to the
general appearance of the street and commercial area where they are located. A welldesigned
sign can be an asset to a building.
 Proportional size and scale. A sign’s scale should be appropriate for the building on which
it is placed and the area where it is located.
 Integrate signs with the building. Signs should be designed
so that they are integrated with the design of the building. Signs
should utilize materials, colors, and shapes that complement the
building’s architectural style and surrounding environment.
New signs proposed for existing buildings should be compatible
with the existing signage of other tenants.
B. Sign Legibility—An effective sign should do more than attract attention; it should communicate
its message clearly. Usually, this is based on the readability of words and phrases. The most
significant influence on legibility is lettering style and spacing. Legible signs tend to:
 Use a brief message. A brief message should be used whenever possible. A sign with a
brief, succinct message is easier to read and looks more attractive because it is less cluttered.
 Avoid hard-to-read, intricate typefaces.
 Limit the number of lettering styles. As a general rule, limit the number of different letter
types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs.
 Avoid spacing letters and words too closely together. As a general rule, letters should not
occupy more than 75 percent of the sign area.
 Avoid large areas of blank spaces. On box or framed signs, 50 percent or more blank area
should generally be avoided. If the total allowed sign area is not required to convey the
message effectively, it is best to reduce the overall size of the sign.
 Use symbols and logos. Symbols and logos can be used in
place of words when appropriate.
 Avoid signs with strange shapes. Signs that are unnecessarily
narrow or oddly shaped can restrict the legibility of
the message. If an unusual shape is not symbolic, it will
probably be confusing.
 Use significant contrast. Substantial contrast should be
provided between the color and material of the background
and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in
both day and night.

Page 453 - 37 (4/14)
16.172.060 General Sign Design Guidelines (continued)
C. Sign Placement—Identifying the appropriate placement for a sign contributes to its overall
effectiveness. Often, a building’s architectural details create logical areas for signage. The
following guidelines help identify appropriate sign locations:
 Respect architectural features. Signs should not cover or interrupt the architectural details
or ornamentation of a building’s façade.
 Create interest. On buildings that have a monolithic or plain façade, signs can be used to
establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion. Well designed signs
create visual interest and continuity with other storefronts
on the same or adjacent buildings.
 Place within structural boundaries. Signs should not
project above the edge of the rooflines and should not
obstruct windows and/or doorways.
 Mark main entries. Signs should be placed at or near
the public entrance to a building or main parking area to
indicate the most direct access to the business.
D. Sign Color—Color is one of the most important factors contributing to the sign’s ability to catch
the eye and communicate a mood or idea. Sign colors should be selected carefully:
 Use contrasting color. Signs should feature substantial contrast between the color and material
of the background and text or symbols. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters
on a light background are most legible. Dark backgrounds with light lettering are preferred
for illuminated cabinet signs.
 Use complementary colors. Sign colors should complement
the materials and colors on the adjacent buildings, including
accent and trim colors.
 Avoid using too many colors. Limited use of accent colors
can increase legibility, while large areas of competing colors
tend to confuse and distract. Colors or color combinations that
interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with
viewer identification of other signs should be avoided.
 Bright day-glo (fluorescent) colors should be avoided as
they are distracting and do not blend well with other background
colors.
E. Sign Materials—Quality construction materials contribute to the sign’s effectiveness and
longevity. Signs should be durable enough to withstand the elements while working well with
the building form and materials. The following should be considered when selecting sign
materials:
 Appropriate materials. Sign materials
should be compatible with the design of the
façade on which they are located. Sign
design should consider the materials and
architectural design of the building and the
sign’s legibility.
16.172.060
Page 453 - 38 (4/14)
16.172.060 General Sign Design Guidelines (continued)
 Durable materials. Sign materials should be extremely durable. Paper, cloth, and vinyl
banner signs are not suitable for exterior use (except high quality, weather-resistant cloth for
awnings). Wood signs should be sealed and maintained to keep moisture from deteriorating
the sign. Signs may not be constructed from plywood, by simply painting letters on wood, or
using “sticker” letters. Commercial grade vinyl letters applied inside glass may be
permissible.
E. Sign Illumination—Appropriate illumination can add to a sign’s legibility; however, the type
and strength of illumination must be carefully considered. Following are guidelines for sign
illumination:
 Sign illumination is regulated in residential districts. The following signs may not feature
illumination:
 Temporary real estate signs at individual home sites
 Temporary real estate signs for subdivisions
 Construction identification signs
 Use illumination only if necessary. Not all signs need to be illuminated. Non-illuminated
signs and window displays may be sufficient to identify the business.
 Use a projected light source. If the sign can be illuminated by a projected light (e.g., spotlight
or gooseneck down light), this is preferred to internal illumination to help better integrate
the sign with the building’s architecture. External lighting fixtures should be small an
unobtrusive and shall not cast light or glare above the horizontal plane of the top of the sign.
 Shield the light source. The light source, whether internal or external, should be shielded
from view or directed so that the light intensity or brightness shall not be objectionable to surrounding
areas. Signs should feature the minimum level required for nighttime readability.
 Illuminated Signs. Individually illuminated letters, either
internally illuminated or backlit (halo lit) solid letters (reverse
channel) are encouraged and are preferred to internally illuminated
cabinet (can) signs. Signs comprised of individual letters
mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive
element of the structure’s façade as a backdrop, better integrating
them with the structure.
 Cabinet signs. The background field should be opaque so that
only the lettering appears illuminated. When the background is
not opaque, the entire face becomes bright and the sign becomes
visually separated from the building, disrupting the continuity
of the façade and making it difficult to read.
 Creative lighting encouraged. The use of creative illumination when compatible with the
building’s architectural style, such as the use of halo lighting, is encouraged where
appropriate.
16.172.060
Page 453 - 39 (4/14)
16.172.060 General Sign Design Guidelines (continued)
 Generally, the use of neon lighting is discouraged. Where artistically appropriate, exposed
neon tubing may be used in conjunction with other types of materials to attractively emphasize
business name and/or logo.
 Signs featuring blinking, rotating, flashing, changing, reflecting, or fluttering lights or
other illuminating device with a changing light intensity, brightness or color are not
permitted.
 Sign Electrical Raceways and Conduits:
 Electrical transformer boxes and raceways should be concealed from public view. If a
raceway cannot be mounted internally behind the finished exterior wall, the exposed metal
surfaces of the raceway should be finished to match the background wall or integrated into
the overall sign design.
 If raceways are necessary, they should be as thin and narrow as possible and should never
extend in width or height beyond the area of the sign’s lettering or graphics.
 All exposed conduit and junction boxes should be concealed from public view.

16.172.070 Sign Maintenance, Abandoned Signs, and Nonconforming Signs
A. Maintaining Signs
All signs must be maintained in the same condition as when the sign was installed. Normal
wear and tear of aged signs shall be repaired when they detract from the visible quality of the
sign, as determined by the Community Development Director. When signs are repaired, they
must be done so in a manner (paint colors shall match, etc.) that is consistent with the originally
approved sign permit and is complimentary to the building or site in which the sign is placed.
When signs are removed, the wall behind the sign shall be repaired and painted to match the
rest of the building wall.
B. Abandoned Signs
Any sign which no longer identifies the current occupant, or bonafide business, after a lapse of
ninety (90) days, shall be deemed an abandoned sign and shall be removed by the owner of the
property on which it is located within thirty (30) days written notice by the community development
department or designated representative. When signs are removed, the wall behind the
sign shall be repaired and painted to match the rest of the building wall. For freestanding signs,
the face of the freestanding sign shall be removed and replaced with a blank face.
C. Unsafe Signs
Any sign that, in the opinion of the chief building official, is unsafe or insecure, shall be
deemed an unsafe sign and shall be corrected or removed, together with any supporting
structure, by using any single or combination of the following methods:
1) Removed or corrected by the owner of the property on which the sign is located, within
forty-eight (48) hours of written notice by the Director; or
2) Removed or corrected by city staff with the business owner being billed for time and materials.
D. Nonconforming Signs
The lawful use of signs existing on the date of the adoption of this Ordinance, or upon
annexation of the property to the city, although such use does not conform to the provisions of
this Chapter, may be continued; provided, however, any nonconforming sign which has been
abandoned or the use for which it is advertised, has ceased to function for a period of ninety
(90) days or more, shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this Chapter.
1) No nonconforming signs shall be structurally altered, reconstructed, or moved in any
manner, without being made to comply with all the appropriate provisions of this
Chapter. However, nothing herein shall prohibit the painting, maintenance or repairing
of such sign, including the face, and changing of copy, except that such repairs shall not
exceed fifty (50%) percent of the value of such sign within any consecutive five-year
period.
2) If, at any time, any sign in existence or maintained on the date of the adoption of the
ordinance codified in this Chapter, or upon annexation of the property to the city, which
does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter, is destroyed by fire, accident,
explosion, or other act of nature, to the extent of more than fifty (50%) percent of the
value thereof, then without further action of the City, such sign shall , from and after the
date of such destruction, be subject to all provisions of this Chapter.
3) For the purpose of this Chapter, the value of any sign shall be the estimated cost of
replacement of the sign, in kind, as determined by the Director.

16.176.030 Violations.
It is a violation of this Title for a property owner
or other person having control of a property to
maintain or permit a nuisance on his property. Any
use of land, structure, or subdivision which is in
violation of this Title or in violation of permits
approved pursuant to the provisions of this Title,
shall constitute a public nuisance and, if not made to
conform, shall be subject to the enforcement
procedures outlined in Section 16.176.040. In the
alternative, the Enforcement Official may seek to
correct violations of this Title under the provisions
of Chapter 1.08 or 1.10 of this Title. (Ord. 606,
1999; Ord. 758, §2 (part), 2007)
16.176.040 Enforcement Procedures.
Unless otherwise specified, the Enforcement
Official shall follow these procedures in the
investigation and enforcement of violations of this
Title:
A. Notice to Comply. When it is determined by
the Enforcement Official that a violation of this Title
exists, written notification of the nature of the
violation shall be given by the Enforcement Official,
by certified or registered mail, to the owner of the
real property involved and anyone known to be in
possession of the parcel. If no address of the owner
appears on the last equalized assessment roll of the
County, or is known to the Enforcement Official,
then a copy of the notice shall be mailed to the
owner at the address of the subject property. The
failure of any person to receive notice shall not
affect in any manner the validity of any proceedings
taken under this Chapter. Written notice may be
personally served by the Enforcement Official. The
Enforcement Official personally serving the written
notice must then execute a Declaration of Personal
Service stating the date, time and place where the
written notice was served, and stating the name of
the person served. The notice must state that the
owner must abate the condition which is a violation
within thirty (30) days from notification. Except
where shown to be otherwise, notification is
presumed to have occurred on the day after the
notice was mailed. The notice shall advise the
recipient of the right to appeal, within thirty (30)
days of notification, pursuant to Subsection B of this
Section. If the Enforcement Official gives verbal
455 8/07
16.176.040
notice of a violation to the owner or violator, the
Enforcement Official shall send the violator, and
owner if someone other than the violator, written
notice to comply via regular United States mail. The
notice shall confirm the date given verbally for
bringing the property into compliance. The
Enforcement Official shall then execute a
Declaration of Notification, declaring that he or she
personally gave verbal notice of the violation to the
owner or violator and mailed a written notice to
comply. The declaration shall state the date, time,
and place where the verbal notice was given. The
time for complying will be calculated from the date
that verbal notice was given. The Enforcement
Official may reduce the thirty (30) days notice time
if he or she determines that an imminent health,
safety, or fire hazard exists.
B. Right to Appeal.
1. If the owner or anyone in possession objects
to the enforcement agency's finding of a violation,
the owner or person in possession may, within thirty

Provisions.
A. Title. The provisions of this Chapter
shall be known as the "Affordable Housing
Program”.

Element of the General Plan, by creating,
preserving, maintaining, and protecting
housing affordable for households of lowand

responsible for alleviating some, but not all,
of the problems associated with affordable
housing. (Ord. 843, 2016, Ord. 869, 2017)
16.194.020 Definitions.

transfers title or there is a default of the
program requirements. (Ord. 869, 2017)
16.194.030 Findings.
In enacting this Chapter, the City Council
of the City of Ripon finds as follows:
A. Housing costs in Ripon have steadily
increased;
B. Substantial need exists for affordable
housing to meet the City’s regional needs as
determined by the State;
C. Requiring new development to pay its
fair share of the costs associated with the
provision of affordable units is consistent
with the City’s Housing Element goals of
fostering an adequate supply of housing for
people at all economic levels and maintaining
both economic diversity and geographically
dispersed affordable housing;
464 (8/18)
16.194.040
D. Rising land prices have contributed to
the lack of new affordable housing.
E. Through careful planning and
adherence to high quality development
standards, including generous street and
sidewalk widths, lot setbacks, densities,
provision of high quality parks and recreation
amenities, maintaining high public safety
staffing ratios, working cooperatively with
the Ripon Consolidated Fire District and
Ripon Unified School District to ensure that
public safety and school facilities are
appropriately funded, and by managing and
limiting residential growth, the City of Ripon
has maintained a quality of life that benefits
Ripon residents and their property values.
F. The existing relatively high property
values in Ripon translate into a “premium” on
each and every residential unit in Ripon,
including new single family residential units,
and results in Ripon being a highly desirable
community for residential home builders. At
the same time, Ripon’s high property values
naturally make home ownership in Ripon less
affordable.
G. New development has, and will
continue to exacerbate the affordable housing
shortage in the City of Ripon, as developers
of single family residential projects will
continue to sell “market rate” homes and will
continue to benefit from the “premium”
described herein.
H. The City Council recognizes that
government, acting alone, cannot solve the
regional problem of affordable housing, but
that new single family residential
development projects can and should
participate in meaningful solutions to prevent
the affordable housing problem from
becoming worse. In addition to the measures
described in this Chapter and applicable to
new single family residential development,
the City Council has designated numerous
parcels which are zoned for multi-family
development. Development of these sites at
higher densities is expected to provide
housing opportunities for low and very low
income residents. Further, the City Council
has approved other programs designed to
promote home ownership for lower income
residents, including but not limited to, a First
Time Homebuyer Down Payment Assistance
Program, low interest housing rehabilitation
loans, Below Market Rate Inclusionary
Housing Program, Pre-Owned BMR Housing
and Pre-owned market rate homes sold under
the BMR Program and similar programs.
Accordingly, the City Council finds that new
single family residential developments are
not burdened disproportionately by the
requirements of this Chapter. (Ord. 843,
2016, Ord. 869, 2017)
16.194.040 General Requirements.
A. Applicability. This Chapter shall
apply to all new residential developments
with dwelling units designed and intended for
residential occupancy in the City’s planning
area. No residential development, other than
that exempted in subsection E of this Section,
shall be undertaken, and no building permits
shall be accepted for processing or issued,
unless the development has been approved in
accordance with this Chapter. The
requirements of this Chapter shall be applied
prior to the application of a density bonus and
no more than once to an approved residential
development, regardless of changes in its
character or ownership, provided that the
total number of dwelling units does not
change.
B. Concurrent Construction. In cases
where the construction of affordable units is
required under this Chapter, all affordable
units in a residential development or phase of
a residential development shall be
constructed prior to or concurrently with
market rate units, as set forth, and in the
location specified, in a schedule of
construction approved by the City and set
forth in the Affordable Housing Agreement
or Development Agreement. The building
465 (8/18)
16.194.050
permits for the last ten percent of the nonrestricted
dwelling units shall not be issued
until the last affordable unit has been issued
a building permit and construction of the last
affordable unit has begun.
C. Design and Distribution of
Affordable Units. All affordable units within
a residential development shall be
comparable to the market rate units in interior
and exterior design, quality, materials,
architectural elements and overall
construction quality, as well as number and
proportion of bedroom types. Affordable
units shall be comparable to the "standard"
landscaping and size. In addition, all
affordable units shall include the same or
similar interior amenities offered for market
rate units within a residential development.
Affordable units shall be dispersed
throughout the residential development so as
to prevent the concentration of affordable
units, unless the Planning Commission has
approved an alternative distribution pattern,
or approval of an off-site location has been
granted.
D. Length of Affordability. It is the
intent of this Affordable Housing Program
that affordable ownership units should
remain affordable for as long as is
practicable, taking into account the City’s
funding and staffing limitations and the
difficulties associated with monitoring
eligibility. Accordingly, the owner of an
affordable ownership unit shall submit such
information as may be required by the
Housing Director, whether annually or at
such frequency deemed necessary and
appropriate by the Housing Director, to
document the owner’s continued occupancy
of the affordable ownership unit, and the
owner’s continued compliance with the
applicable terms and conditions of this
Chapter. Upon the sale of any affordable
ownership unit, the Owner shall comply with
the provisions of Section 16.194.090 C of this
Chapter. (Ord. 843, 2016).
E. Exemptions. The following are
exempt from the provisions of this Chapter:
1. Replacement housing due to
natural disaster on a one for one basis (i.e.,
one dwelling unit replaced for each legally
existing dwelling unit);
2. Modifications to existing
properties or structures that do not increase
the number of dwelling units;
3. Residential care facilities with
dwelling units that are non self-sufficient
units; that is, they do not include kitchen
facilities (if a project includes both selfsufficient
and non self-sufficient units, only
the latter are exempt);
4. A residential second unit (as
defined by state law) on an existing
residential lot, subject to compliance with the
zoning ordinance.
5. Rental housing units (apartments,
duplexes, triplexes).
F. Affordability
Requirement/Alternatives for Compliance.
Developers of single family residential
developments with dwelling units designed
and intended for residential occupancy have
several options for achieving compliance
with this Ordinance, each option is described
in subsections 16.194.050, 16.194.060 and
16.194.070. (Ord. 869, 2017)

of the loan. The entire amount of the City
Subsidy shall be paid back to the City of
Ripon upon sale or transfer of the home or if
there is a default of any of the program
requirements. Any repayment of those funds

unchanged.
ii. If homeowner is refinancing
and taking cash out, the entire second loan
(down payment assistance) shall be due and
payable in full. The City of Ripon will agree

Fair Market Value. (Ord. 877, 2018)
16.194.060 BMR Affordable Units
A. Any developer shall ensure that 5% of
the total units within a residential
development project will meet BMR
Affordable Unit requirements for sale to low

C. BMR Affordable Unit Sales
Requirements
1. The BMR sales price for eligible
BMR residential units under this Chapter
shall be based upon following parameters
based on income categories:

sales price shall be based upon a maximum
affordable housing cost for that category.
The maximum affordable housing cost shall
be thirty percent (30%) of seventy percent
(70%) of area median income as adopted by
resolution on a yearly basis. The sales price
is therefore established by assuming a 3.5%
down payment and the maximum allowable
housing cost for the income category.
ii. For Moderate income units
the sales price shall be based upon a
maximum affordable housing cost for that
category. The maximum affordable housing
cost shall be thirty-five percent (35%) of one
hundred ten percent (110%) of area median
income as adopted by resolution on a yearly
basis. The sales price is therefore established
by assuming a 3.5% down payment and the
maximum allowable housing cost for the
income category.
2. The BMR Buyer shall enter into
an equity recapture agreement with the City
of Ripon upon purchase of the home. Such
equity recapture agreement shall require the
BMR Buyer to repay one hundred percent
(100%) of the difference between the actual
sales price of the unit at time of purchase and
the fair market value of the unit at time of
purchase (“City Subsidy”). The City Subsidy
shall be considered a “silent loan” on the
home and shall not accrue any interest for the
duration of the loan. The entire amount of the
City Subsidy shall be paid back to the City of
Ripon upon sale or transfer of the home or if
there is a default of any of the program
requirements. Any repayment of those funds
shall be used for future affordable housing

purchase of a BMR unit based upon income
limits, credit score and other requirements
adopted by the City Council by resolution
and amended from time to time.

not allowed under this program.
4. The processing of loan papers
upon refinancing or sale of unit will be

80% of the Fair Market Value. (Ord. 869,
2017)
469 (8/18)
16.194.070
16.194.070 Negotiated Affordable Units
The developer may negotiate an
Alternative Equivalent Proposal with the
Affordable Housing Committee, subject to
approval by the City Council, which specifies
an alternate means of satisfying this Chapter.
An Alternative Equivalent Proposal may
include, but is not limited to, payment of an
in-lieu fee, dedication of vacant developable
land, construction of affordable units on
another site, and conversion of existing
market rate for-sale or for-rent dwelling units
within the City to affordable units through
acquisition and enforcement of required
affordability restrictions consistent with this
Chapter. All alternative equivalent proposals
must be submitted in writing, demonstrate
that the alternative equivalent will further
affordable housing in the City to an equal or
greater extent than the construction of
required on-site affordable units required
under this Chapter and satisfy the following
minimum conditions: (1) be consistent with
the City’s Housing Element; (2) provide the
same number or greater of affordable units;
(3) have equivalent or lesser impact on the
City’s administrative obligations, including
maintenance and management duties, than
the on-site requirement; and (4) must result in
the actual construction of affordable
ownership units. (Ord. 869, 2017)
16.194.080 Affordable Housing In-Lieu
Fee
The In-Lieu fee for BMR Plus Affordable
Units with down payment assistance and
BMR Affordable Units shall be calculated
using the following formulas:
A. BMR Plus In-Lieu Fee. The
difference between the median home price in
Ripon and the applicable FHA lending limit,
plus the down payment for a BMR Plus unit,
divided by 10 units. By way of example:
1. Example with a median home
sales price in Ripon of $400,000 and an
upper FHA lending limit of $333,500.00.
(400,000 – 333,500) + (333,500 x .035) = $7,817.25 per unit
10
B. BMR In-Lieu Fee. The difference
between the median home price in Ripon and
the applicable Moderate BMR sales price
times the required moderate units for a
subdivision plus the difference between the
median home price in Ripon and the
applicable Low BMR sales price times the
required low units for a subdivision divided
by number of units in the subdivision. By
way of example:
1. Example with a median home sales
price in Ripon of $400,000, a Moderate BMR
Sales Price of $250,000 and a Low BMR
Sales Price of $110,000 for a 100 lot
subdivision.
(400,000 – 250,000) x 3.8 + (400,000 – 110,000) x 1.3 = $9,470.00
100 per unit
C. Payment of In-Lieu Fee to satisfy
fractional requirements of affordable units. If
a developer is required to pay an in-lieu fee
to meet fractional affordable housing
requirements, the fractional requirement shall
be met by multiplying the fractional
requirement by the appropriate per unit inlieu
fee for the affordable housing category
required. For example a 10.8 affordable
BMR Plus unit requirement, would require
10 units to be built meeting the BMR Plus
affordable requirements and payment of the
per unit BMR Plus affordable in-lieu fee
multiplied by 0.8.
D. A Developer may opt to buy out of
the affordable requirements for a project by
paying an in-lieu fee. In order to buy out of
their affordable requirements a developer
shall take the appropriate per unit in-lieu fee
and multiply the per unit fee by the number
469-1 (8/18)
16.194.090
of market rate units in the subdivision. (Ord.
869, 2017)
16.194.090 Other Implementation
Procedures.
A. Satisfaction of Affordable Housing
Requirement. Each proposal for satisfying
the City’s affordable housing requirement,
together with any proposed Affordable
Housing Agreement shall be reviewed by the
Planning Director or designee, considered for
recommendation by the Affordable Housing
Committee, and forwarded to the City
Council for approval.
B. Agreements. Prior to the approval of
a Tentative Map for any residential
development to which this Chapter applies,
the City and the residential developer shall
enter into a Development Agreement or
Affordable Housing Agreement in a form
approved by the City Attorney. For
ownership affordable units, the City and the
individual homebuyer may, at the discretion
of the Planning Director, enter into a recorded
Refinance and Resale Limitation Agreement
in a form approved by the City Attorney. The
City Administrator or designee is authorized
to execute Affordable Housing Agreements,
resale controls and/or rent restrictions and
any other documents necessary to effectuate
the implementation of this Chapter, provided
such agreements and documents are
consistent with the requirements of this
Chapter.
C. City’s Right of Option to Purchase
Affordable Ownership Units. The resale
restrictions as set forth in the Refinance and
Resale Limitation Agreement for BMR Plus
or BMR units shall provide that in the event
the owner of a BMR Plus or BMR wishes to
sell their unit, the owner shall first give
written notice of such circumstances, and an
option to purchase, to the City of Ripon. In
the event the City Response Notice notifies
the Owner that the City does not wish to
exercise its right to purchase the affordable
unit, then the Owner may proceed to sell the
Unit in compliance with the following
requirements:
1. Selling the Unit for Fair Market.
If the Owner receives a bona fide offer from
a "Market Purchaser" to purchase the Unit
and the Owner accepts the Market
Purchaser's offer, upon sale of the Unit, the
Owner shall pay to the City the entire amount
due under the City Note(s) and/or agreements
upon close of escrow.
2. Selling the Unit to another BMR
Plus Purchaser or Below Market Rate
Purchaser. If the Owner chooses to sell the
Unit at an affordable price to an affordable
household, the “BMR Plus Purchaser” or
“Below Market Purchaser”, under the same
income category the unit originally sold, the
City Subsidy including any accrued interest
will be waived. The affordable purchase price
shall be determined by the City, under its
BMR Plus or Below Market Rate Housing
Program and the new buyer must meet all the
requirements of the BMR Plus or Below
Market Rate program and execute program
documents prior to close of escrow. A new
City Subsidy will be established with the new
BMR Plus Purchaser or Below Market Rate
Purchaser. The new City Subsidy will be
determined using the difference between the
Fair Market Value of the home, as
determined by an appraisal, and the BMR
Plus or Below Market Rate purchase price.
D. Selection Criteria for Ownership
Units. No household at the time of move-in
shall be permitted to purchase or occupy an
affordable unit that is required under this
Chapter unless its qualifications are
consistent with this Chapter and the Housing
Director has approved the household's
eligibility. Eligible potential occupants of
ownership affordable units must be first-time
homebuyers and will be qualified on the basis
of household income as established by the
Housing Director using available
governmental indices, including but not
469-2 (8/18)
16.194.090
limited to all sources of income and assets,
the relationship between household size and
the size of the available units, and any further
criteria required by law and/or established by
resolution of the City Council. The City shall
use an equitable selection method established
in conformance with the terms of this Chapter
and in compliance with state and federal law.
First priority shall be given to current Ripon
residents who either reside or work within the
City of Ripon’s zip code or planning area as
defined in the Land Use Element of the
General Plan.
E. Use and Expenditure of Fees.
1. All fees collected under this
Chapter shall be deposited into a separate
account administered by the City
Administrator or his/her designee, to be
designated the City Affordable Housing
Fund.
2. The fees collected under this
Chapter and all earnings from investment off
the fees shall be expended exclusively for
provision of below market rate housing in the
City through acquisition, construction,
development assistance, paying the costs of
administering this Chapter, rehabilitation,
financing, rent subsidies or other methods.
The housing shall be of a type, or made
affordable at a cost or rent, for which there is
an unmet need in the City and which is not
adequately supplied in the City by private
housing development in the absence of public
assistance. Ord. 646 §1,201; Ord. §1, 2003;

16.200.010 Definitions.
1. AGRICULTURAL LAND. All real
property currently used for agricultural operations.
2. AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. The
cultivation and tillage of the soil; dairying; the
production, irrigation, frost protection, cultivation,
growing, harvesting, and processing of any
agricultural commodity, including viticulture,
horticulture, timber or apiculture, the raising of
livestock, fur bearing animals, fish or poultry; and
any commercial agricultural practices performed as
incident to or in conjunction with such operations,
including preparation for market, delivery to storage
or to market, or to carriers or transportation to
market.(Ord. 608 § 1, 2000)
16.200.020 Policy Statement.
1. It is the policy of the City of Ripon to
preserve, protect and encourage the use of viable
agricultural lands for the production of food and
other agricultural products, It is the further intent of
the City to provide notification of the City’s
recognition and support of persons and/or entities
right to farm.
2. Where nonagricultural land uses extend into
agricultural lands or exist side by side, agricultural
operations frequently become the subject of nuisance
complaints. Such nuisance complaints may result in
the curtailment or cessation of agricultural
operations and discourage investment in such
operations. It is the purpose of this Chapter to
reduce the loss of agricultural operations by
clarifying the circumstances under which
agricultural operations may be considered a
nuisance. This Chapter is not to be construed as in
any way modifying or abridging State law as set out
in the California Civil Code, Health and Safety
Code, Fish and Game Code, Food and Agricultural
Code, Division 7 of the Water Code, or any other
applicable provisions of State law relative to
nuisances. Rather it is only to be utilized in the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
City codes and regulations.
3. This Chapter is also intended to promote a
good neighbor policy by advising purchasers
adjacent to or near agricultural operations of the
inherent potential problems associated with such a
purchase. Such concerns may include, but are not
limited to, the noises, odors, dust, chemicals, smoke
and hours of operation that may accompany
agricultural operations. It is intended that, through
mandatory disclosure, purchasers will better
understand the impact of living or working near
agricultural operations and be prepared to accept
attendant conditions as the natural result of living or
working in or near agricultural areas. (Ord. 608 § 1,
2000)
16.200.030 Nuisance.
No agricultural activity, operation, or facility
conducted or maintained for commercial purposes in
a manner consistent with proper and accepted
customs and standards as established and followed
by similar agricultural operations and in compliance
with all Federal, State, and local laws and
regulations shall be or become a nuisance, public or
private, pursuant to this Title. (Ord. 608 § 1, 2000;
Ord. 758, §2 (part), 2007)
16.200.040 Disclosure.
The approval of parcel maps, tentative maps or
vesting tentative maps adjacent to or near
472 (8/07)
16.200.040
agricultural lands shall require the owner/developer
or successors in interest to notify all purchasers of
lots within the project site of the nature and extent of
existing agricultural activities, operations, and
facilities in the vicinity of the project site. If the first
purchase of a lot is a builder, this requirement shall
be extended so that the actual and ultimate
homeowner receives the notice. This disclosure
shall also provide notice of the potential conflicts or
effects of typical agricultural activities including, but
not limited to, noise, odors, dust, agricultural
spraying, agricultural burning, etc. Furthermore,
notice shall be provided that, pursuant to California
Civil Code Section 3482.5, typical agricultural
activities shall not be considered a nuisance except
as otherwise provided in that Civil Code Section.

16.210.210 Development Encroachment in
Petroleum Areas.
A. Onsite Petroleum Facilities. Where a
developer proposes to subdivide, rezone or
otherwise develop property, which contains existing
drilling and/or production operations, the developer
may provide a plan showing how all existing
petroleum related facilities will be protected and
integrated into the proposed development so such
facilities will satisfy the requirements of this chapter.
The developer may also submit a plan of the ultimate
use of the land after cessation of petroleum
operations and abandonment of the wells. Any
buildable lot containing an area which may not be
built upon because development could not comply
with this chapter shall be encumbered by the
developer with a deed restriction specifying the area

such encumbrance shall be recorded concurrent with
the final map. If a petroleum facility is subsequently
abandoned, such lot may then be considered for
development, pursuant to this chapter.
B. Abandoned Wells. Tentative maps, planned
development and other development plans submitted
to the city may show the location of all wells drilled
on the property. Prior to development of an area, any
well shown as abandoned shall be accompanied by
written verification for the DOG. Development shall
be designed such that the building official is satisfied
that no structure will be built within ten feet of any
well that has been properly abandoned pursuant to
DOG requirements. Any lot or parcel containing an
abandoned well shall be encumbered with a deed,
restriction specifying the exact location of such well
and prohibiting any construction within said ten foot
area. If a final map is recorded, the encumbrance
shall be recorded concurrent with the final map. The
DOG, at their discretion, may also require that any
abandoned well be uncovered,' tested for leakage;
require remedial work on leaking wells, and be
accurately located on the final map before
recordation of the map.
C. Drilling Islands. As part of any rezoning,
subdivision, or other development, the developer
may provide the city with written documentation that
he/she has contacted all mineral rights owners who
have rights of surface entry on the property, to either
reserve lands for future drilling and/or production
operations as drilling islands, or to waive their rights
to drill for oil and gas under the surface, within the
subject site. Drilling islands shall be no less than two
net acres in size, configured so that the proposed
development -and petroleum activities can be
adequately buffered from one another, provide for
adequate access, and be accompanied with a plan of
the ultimate use of the site after abandonment or a
decision not to pursue petroleum operations. Future
drilling and/or production operations shall be
required to acquire necessary permits as well as
satisfy all well site development standards. (Ord. 707

drainage, as may be determined by engineering
analysis of soils and geologic conditions and by
taking into account probable future uses of the
site. Final slopes shall not be steeper than two
feet horizontal to one foot vertical (2:1) unless
the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the planning commission that any such
steeper slope will not:
1. Be incompatible with the alternate
future uses approved for the site;
2. Be hazardous to persons that may utilize
the site under the alternate future uses approved
for the site; and
3. Reduce the effectiveness of revegetation
and erosion control measures where such are
necessary. In no event shall the steepness of
slopes exceed the critical gradient as determined
by an engineering analysis of the slope stability.
F. Backfilling and Grading. Backfilled and
graded areas shall be compacted to avoid
excessive settlement and to the degree necessary
to accommodate anticipated future uses. If
future use of the site contemplates structures for
human occupancy, fill placement shall conform

for improvements consisting of the installation of curb,
gutter and sidewalk across the street frontage of
applicant’s property and the installation of other street
improvements across the frontage of applicant’s property
to the centerline of the street. (Ord. 819, 2015)
16.216.030 Determinations.
The City Administrator or his/her appointee
shall determine if a Local Benefit District is necessary
for oversized utilities or improvements determined to
benefit the local area. If he/she determines such district
is required, he/she shall determine the properties to be in
such District. The City Administrator or his/her
appointee shall prepare a report on his/her determination
of the proposed boundaries, the eligible improvements
for reimbursement, and the method of apportioning costs
among benefitted properties, and shall file it with the
City Clerk. The City Administrator’s report shall be
referred to as the “LBD Report”. The City Clerk shall
appoint a time and place for a public hearing on the
proposed District boundaries and the apportionment of
costs upon benefitted properties. The City Clerk shall
give notice of the hearing at least fifteen (15) days
before the date thereof by mail, postage prepaid, to all
persons owning real property proposed to be included
within the District, whose names and addresses appear
on the last equalized assessment roll for City taxes, or
who are known to the Clerk.
The notice shall contain:
A. A statement of the time, place and purpose for
the hearing on the report of the City
Administrator or his/her appointee.
B. A statement that any person interested may
submit comments in writing or personally
appear at the hearing to address the proposed
LBD Report, including the proposed Local
Benefit District boundaries, the scope of

costs among benefitted properties.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council may
approve, deny or modify the LBD Report, including but
not limited to the properties or portions thereof to be
included in the Local Benefit District, the list of eligible
improvements and the method of apportioning costs
among benefitted properties.
Upon approval by the City Council, all of such
properties, including the applicant’s property, shall be
named a Local Benefit District, and notice of formation
of the Local Benefit District shall be recorded against
each parcel within the District. Thereafter, the applicant
shall be entitled to be the recipient (the “Recipient”) of
District charges collected by the City pursuant to the
provisions of this Chapter. (Ord. 819, 2015)
16.216.040 Apportionment of costs.
In preparing the Local Benefit District Report,
the City Administrator or his/her appointee shall make a
proposed apportionment of costs among the properties in
the District as follows:
The City Administrator or his/her appointee shall
determine the amount of costs to be apportioned. Costs
shall be apportioned using a method deemed appropriate
by the City Administrator or his/her appointee, and may
include, but shall not be limited to, total acreage within
the proposed District, the lineal frontage of all properties
within the proposed District, or some reasonable
combination of those of other data (e.g. retail, office,
mixed use, etc.), in the discretion of the City
Administrator or his/her
16.216.050
497-2
appointee. “District frontage” shall include planned, but
not yet installed major thoroughfares, but shall exclude
subdivision or planned development interior streets.
Following the date the applicant’s improvements are
accepted by the City, until paid, said costs shall be
adjusted annually as of January 1st of each year to reflect
an increase or decrease as shown in the Engineering
News Record Building Cost Index published for the 20
city average as of the previous July 1st. (Ord. 819, 2015)
16.216.050 City administrative costs.
The Director of Finance shall determine the cost
to the City in administering each Local Benefit District,
and such costs shall be equitably prorated among the
properties in the District. (Ord. 819, 2015)
16.216.060 Imposition and payment of district
charges.
District charges applicable to a given parcel within the
District shall be imposed and paid as follows:
A. Timing of Imposition of LBD Charges. The
requirement to pay all District charges, including
City administrative charges, shall be imposed by
the City as a condition of approval of the first
“discretionary land use entitlement” on the
subject property. The timing of payment of
District charges shall be in accordance with
Subsection B of this Section. For purposes of
this Section, “discretionary land use entitlement”
includes the approval of any Conditional Use
Permit, Tentative Subdivision Map or Parcel
Map, Development Agreement, Mixed Use or
Planned Unit Development, General Plan
Amendment, rezoning, pre-zoning, or Specific
Plan for the subject parcel.
B. Timing of Payment of LBD Charges.
Notwithstanding the timing of imposition of
District charges as set forth in Subsection A,
District charges imposed upon residential
projects shall be paid at the time of approval of
the Final Map or Parcel Map, as applicable. In
the case of a parcel zoned commercial, retail,
office or mixed use which is created by Parcel
Map, all District charges for said parcel shall be
paid at the time of issuance of the first building
permit on the parcel. Property having less than
an even number of acres shall pay an acreage fee
prorated in direct proportion to any fractional
acreage.
C. Exceptions. “Development” shall not include
any Lot Line Adjustment, Building Permit
issued by the City or by San Joaquin County for
the remodeling of an existing residence, the
construction or remodeling of any second unit
dwelling, reconstruction of any wholly or
partially damaged or demolished structure, or
the construction of one single family residence
on an existing single parcel of land.
D. Developed Parcels. In the case of a developed
parcel for which no discretionary land use
entitlements are needed, District charges shall be
imposed at the time of application for water or
sewer service for said parcel.
E. City’s Discretion to Defer Payment. For good
cause, the City Administrator or his/her
appointee shall have the discretion to defer
payment of fees until the issuance of building
permits upon the posting of bonds or other
security in a form and amount acceptable to the
City Attorney for guaranty of payment of
District charges to the Recipient.
F. Alternative Payment Arrangements. Nothing in
this Chapter shall be construed to prohibit a
property owner from paying District charges
prior to development, as defined herein, or from
negotiating directly with the Recipient for an
alternative payment arrangement, provided that
any such alternative arrangement shall not
operate to increase the District charges
attributable to any other parcel within the
District. The Recipient of District charges
pursuant to this Chapter may elect to receive
credits against development impact fees which
would otherwise be due and payable in
connection with any projects proposed by the
Recipient.
G. Reimbursement to Applicant. As a condition to
receiving reimbursement pursuant to this
Chapter, the City and an eligible applicant for
reimbursement within an adopted LBD shall
enter into a Reimbursement Agreement
specifying the amount, priority and timing of
reimbursements to be remitted to the applicant
from benefitting parcels which develop within
the District. The amount, priority and timing of
reimbursements shall be determined by the City
Engineer. (Ord. 819, 2015)

17.08.010 Purpose.
It is found and determined that the public
interest, convenience, health, safety and welfare
require that owners, subdividers and/or developers,
within the corporate limits of the City, share in the
cost of the construction of certain traffic
improvements to provide for the safe and orderly
flow of vehicular traffic within the City. The need
for such improvements is determined to be directly
related to land development, as each land
development generates additional traffic in the
vicinity of the development, as well as affecting
city-wide traffic, that contributes to a deterioration in
the safe and orderly movement of traffic in the City.
(Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007)
17.08.020 Payment of Fees.
The owner, subdivider or developer shall
provide security for the payment, or shall pay the
fees as established by resolution of the City Council
of the City or within the Public Facilities Finance
Plan, for these traffic signal installations and
improvements to the city prior to the issuance of any
building permit for any development determined to
be subject to the provisions of this Chapter by the
City. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007)
17.08.030 Public Hearing.
A. In the event the City determines that a local
benefit area should be established to fairly spread the
cost of traffic signal improvements to benefitted
properties, the City shall hold a public hearing for
the purpose of establishing the boundaries of any
proposed local benefit area, the estimated costs,
whether actual or estimated, and a fair method of
allocation of costs to the area of benefit and
apportionment of fees for any traffic signal
installation, all as determined by City.
B. Said public hearing shall be noticed as
provided in Section 65905 of the California
Government Code.
C. A description of the local benefit area, costs,
allocation of cost and any fee structure established at
the hearing, shall be set forth in a resolution of the
City council, a certified copy of which shall be
recorded in the office of the County Recorder, after
the same have been determined by the City. (Ord.
606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007)
17. 08.040 Protest.
A. A written protest may be filed with the City
Clerk at any time prior to the public hearing held in
accordance with Section 17.80.030 or may be
presented at said hearing.
B. If written protests are filed by the owners of
more than one-half of the area of real property to be
benefited and sufficient protests are not withdrawn
so as to reduce the area represented in the protest to
less than one-half (2) of that to be benefited, then the
proceedings shall be abandoned, and the City
Council shall not, for one year from the filing of the
written protests, commence or carry on any
proceeding for the same improvement or acquisition
under this section.
C. Any protest may be withdrawn by the owner
of the real property making the same in writing, at
any time prior to the conclusion of a public hearing
held pursuant to this Chapter.
D. If any majority protest is directed against
only a portion of the proposed improvements, the
503 (8/07)
17.08.040
portion so protested shall be subject to the one-year
(1) prohibition stated in this section, but the city
council shall not be prohibited from commencing
new proceedings that do not include the portion of
improvements which the majority protest is directed
against. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007)
17. 08.050 Expenditure of Fees.
A. Fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be
expended solely for the construction or
reimbursement for construction of traffic signal
installations serving the area to be benefited, and
from which fees comprising the fund were collected,
or to reimburse the City for the cost of constructing
the improvements.
B. The City may advance money from its
general fund to pay the cost of constructing any of
the improvements. Any funds so advanced by the
City are to be reimbursed from the facility fund or
funds. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007)
17. 08.060 Exceptions.
No fees pursuant to this Chapter shall be due for
any building permit issued to:
A. The United States of America or any agency
thereof;
B. The state of California or a political
subdivision of the state;
C. Redevelopment or building modifications
which increases the traffic generation by less than
ten (10%) percent. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5
(part), 2007)
17. 08.070 Traffic Signal Installation and
Improvements.
The owner, subdivider or developer shall be
responsible for the following traffic signal
improvements, if required by the city:
A. Traffic signals within the subdivision or
development shall be installed when warrants are
met or when required by the City upon
recommendation of the City Engineer;
B. Relocation and/or modifications of existing
traffic signals to conform to street improvements to
be constructed by the owner, subdivider and/or
developer;
C. Conduits, pull boxes, and foundations for
future traffic signals within or adjacent to the
subdivision or development to facilitate future traffic
signal construction and to minimize street
excavation;
D. Traffic signals to mitigate the adverse
environmental impacts of the subdivision or
development. These signals must be located within
the sphere of influence of the subdivision or
development as determined by the City. (Ord. 606,
1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007)
17. 08.080 Implementation Requirements.
The need to install a particular traffic signal
shall be predicated on traffic conditions meeting
warrants as prescribed in the current Caltrans Traffic
Manual. The status of traffic conditions, and the
extent to which the warrants are met, shall be
determined through a traffic impact analysis,
conducted by a licensed traffic engineer. A study
may be required by the City for developments
producing more than one thousand (1,000) trips per
day, with the cost to be paid by owner, subdivider
and/or developer. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5
(part), 2007)
17. 08.090 Cost Allocation.
A. The fee for traffic signal improvements shall
be divided into two parts as determined by the city.
The first shall cover a share of the city-wide needs,
while the second shall be for mitigating conditions
of a localized area because of the new development.
B. The sharing of costs shall be based upon the
trip ends generated by the new development, as
shown in the current International Traffic Engineers
(ITE) Trip Generation Manual, which is updated
periodically. The planning department shall
determine the most comparable trip generation factor
for buildings not listed, and consider any data
provided by a developer (prepared by a licensed
traffic engineer) for a specific project, in establishing
fees.
504 (8/07)
17.08.090
C. The cost per trip end shall be determined by
dividing the total estimated costs of improvements,
including plans and specifications, and the cost of
construction and engineering as determined by the
city engineer, by the total number of trip ends. For
mitigation of traffic problems related to specific
developments or benefit areas, the costs may be
proportioned by the City Engineer in accordance
with the benefits of individual properties.
D. The dollar amount of the fees shall be set
and established from time to time by resolution of
the City Council. The fees for city-wide traffic
improvements shall be increased or decreased
annually in accordance with the Engineers News
Index published, and in effect on July 1st of each
year, hereafter. (Ord. 606, 1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part),

17.12.010 Purpose and Intent.
In order to implement the goals and objectives
of the San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat
Conservation and Open Space Plan (SJMSCP), and
to mitigate the cumulative impacts of new
development on undeveloped lands within the City
of Ripon and in San Joaquin County, the
establishment of preserve lands will be necessary to
compensate for impacts to threatened, endangered,
rare and unlisted SJMSCP Covered Species and
other wildlife, and compensation for some
non-wildlife related impacts to recreation,
agriculture, scenic values and other beneficial Open
Space uses.
In accordance with Sections 7.3, 7.4.1, 7.4.1.1,
7.4.1.3, and 7.4.1.4 of the SJMSCP, new
development will pay approximately 60% of total
SJMSCP costs with the exception of vernal pool
conversions that will pay 100% of total SJMSCP
costs. While those undertaking new development
pursuant to the SJMSCP may opt to dedicate lands
consistent with the SJMSCP preserve designs or to
purchase credits from mitigation banks, most of the
60% contribution to the SJMSCP costs from new
development will be in the form of development
fees.
The Ripon City Council is required to establish
a fee ordinance in accordance to Section 5.1.1.(b) of
the SJMSCP Implementation Agreement for the
purpose of collecting fee monies to finance the
SJMSCP. In establishing the fee described in the
following sections, the Ripon City Council has
found the fee to be consistent with the SJMSCP
Funding Plan as provided in Chapter 7 of the
SJMSCP. (Ord. 648 § 1, 2001; Ord. 758 §5 (part),
2007)
17.12.020 SJMSCP Development Fee
A. Establishment of Fees. The SJMSCP
Development Fee is hereby established for new
development pursuant to the SJMSCP in the City of
Ripon to pay for preserve lands to mitigate the
cumulative impacts related to new development,
including but not limited to acquisition,
enhancement, restoration, maintenance, and/or
operation of habitat/open space conservation lands.
The fee shall not be collected until the City of
Ripon, in a Council Resolution:
1. Sets forth purpose of the fee;
2. Identifies the specific use(s) to be financed;
3. Describes how there is a reasonable
relationship between the fee’s use and the type of
development project;
4. Determines how there is a reasonable
relationship between the need for use(s) and type(s)
of development project(s);
5. Determine the amount of the fee and how
there is a reasonable relationship between the
amount of the fee and the cost of the preserve lands
or portion thereof attributable to the development;
and
6. Establishment of a separate development fee
account into which the fees shall be placed, provides
for the appropriation of the fees, and references the
proposed transfer of fees to SJCOG, Inc. (a.k.a. JPA
as per the SJMSCP).
B. Annual Adjustment. Any fee established
pursuant to a resolution under this Chapter shall be
adjusted each year by an amount consistent with the
California Construction Cost Index (CCCI) as
published by the Engineering News Record and/or in
conformance with Section 7.5.2.2. of the SJMSCP,
506 (8/07)
and as approved by SJCOG, Inc.
17.12.020
The proposed fee adjustments shall be adopted
by the Ripon City Council before April 30th of each
year. All fee adjustments shall be effective on
July 1st.
C. Interest. All fees collected pursuant to this
Chapter shall be credited with interest on such fees
while in possession of the City of Ripon. The
interest earned shall be credited to the account in
which the fee was deposited and shall be retained by
the City of Ripon until transferred to SJCOG, Inc.
account.
D. Payment of Fees. All fees to be collected
under this Chapter shall be collected in accordance
to Chapter 5.3.2.3 of the SJMSCP.
E. Use of Fee or Refund. The Chief Financial
Officer of SJCOG, Inc. shall make findings once
each fiscal year with respect to any portion of any
moneys, excluding letters of credit or other security
instruments, that is remaining unexpended or
uncommitted in the SJCOG, Inc. account for five (5)
or more years after deposit of the fee, to identify the
purpose to which the fee is to be put, and to
demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the
fee and the purpose for which it was charged.
There shall be refunded to the then current
record owner or owners of the parcels of the
development project or projects on a prorated basis
the unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee,
and any interest accrued thereon, for which need
cannot be demonstrated pursuant to this subdivision.
The refund shall be made from the unexpended
or uncommitted revenues by direct payment, or by
any other means consistent with the intent of this
Section. If the administrative costs of refunding
unexpended or uncommitted revenues pursuant to
this subdivision exceed the amount to be refunded,
the SJCOG, Inc. Board of Directors, after a public
hearing, may determine the revenues shall be
allocated for some other purpose for which the fees
are collected subject to this Ordinance and which
serves the project on which the fee was originally
imposed. (Ord. 648 § 1, 2001; Ord. 758 §5 (part),
2007)
17.12.030 Use of Fees
The fees paid pursuant to this Chapter shall be
placed in separate fee account to avoid commingling
of the fees with other funds of the City of Ripon.
The fees may be temporarily invested. Such fees,
along with any interest earnings, shall be used solely
to pay for those uses(s) described in the Resolution
enacted pursuant to Section Ripon which shall
include the following:
1. To pay for acquisition of preserve lands
(and associated transaction costs);
2. To pay for monitoring and restoration
and/or enhancement of preserve lands;
3. To pay for endowment for long-term
management of preserve lands; and
4. To pay for initial and on-going
administration of the SJMSCP.
No less frequently than quarterly, and pursuant
to Section 5.1.1(d) of the Implementation
Agreement, the City of Ripon shall transfer the
development fee funds in the City of Ripon SJMSCP
Development Fee Account to SJCOG, Inc. Wherein,
those funds shall be deposited in the SJCOG, Inc.
account. All proceeds in the SJCOG, Inc. account
not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be
invested in an interest bearing account. (Ord. 648,
§1, 2001; Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007)

specifically studied therein, but also within
the remainder of the City of Ripon which
were not studied therein. The City Council
further finds that there is a need for the
establishment of uniform and consistent
development impact fees in connection
with the development of real property
within the City of Ripon, to finance the
public facilities, public improvements, and
community amenities within the City
necessitated by such development. The
City Council further finds that the fees and
charges set forth in the Public Facilities
Finance Plan and AB 1600 Fee
Justification Study, as amended, are
necessary and proper and required in order
that the owner or developer’s fair share of
public facilities impacts within the City are
mitigated. (Ord. 874 § 1, 2018)
B. Any acreage, lot or parcel of real
property, even though it may not be legally
defined as a “subdivision” within the
meaning of this Code or the California
Subdivision Map Act, shall nonetheless
pay, at the time of development, all
applicable development fees, as set forth in
this Chapter, just as if the real property was
in fact a subdivision. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of a single lot split of
real property within the City, the
development fees set forth in this Chapter
shall be applicable only to the undeveloped
parcel of real property in any single lot
split. All fees applicable to the
development of residential real property
within the City shall be paid at the time of
gas meter release inspection, but not later
than the date of final inspection, whichever
comes first. In the case of non-residential
development projects, the development
impact fees set forth in this Chapter shall
be paid at the time of issuance of a building
permit, except that the Director may in his
discretion, allow the payment of nonresidential
development fees to be deferred
until the time of gas meter release
inspection, but not later than the date of
final inspection, whichever comes first.
The City Council may adopt implementing
policies and procedures consistent with
this Chapter by resolution. (Ord. 874 § 1,
2018)
C. The development impact fees
specifically set forth in the Public Facilities
Finance Plan and the AB 1600 Fee
Justification Study are hereby adopted and
approved, and are applicable throughout
the entire City of Ripon, in accordance
with the provisions of this Chapter. The
aforementioned development impact fees
shall be listed in the City Fee Schedule and
will automatically be adjusted as of
January 1 of each year, pursuant to the
Engineering News Record Building Cost
Index published and in effect on July 1st of
each year hereafter. In addition, the City
Council may, from time to time, adjust the
development impact fees listed in the City
Fee Schedule, by resolution.
D. Nothing in this Chapter shall be
deemed to limit the discretion of the City
Council to negotiate Development
Agreements with property owners which
Development Agreements may provide for
the payment of development impact fees of
different types and amounts, based upon
the nature and impact of the development
project proposed by the property owner.
E. Nothing in this Chapter shall be
deemed to modify or waive any obligation
of a property owner to repay Benefit
Assessment District assessments, which
17.16.020
509 (06/20)
assessments are to be paid at the time of
development of real property. Benefit
Assessment District Fees may be collected
at the time of approval of a Subdivision
Improvement Agreement prior to the
recording of a Final Subdivision Map, or at
such time as may be provided in a
Development Agreement for the property.
F. Real property development fees
previously imposed and collected in the
City pursuant to the requirements of the
Mitigation Fee Act (AB 1600) shall, for
monitoring purposes, be allocated to the
real property development fees imposed
pursuant to the Public Facilities Finance
Plan, the AB 1600 Fee Justification Study,
and the provisions of this Chapter, as set
forth in the AB 1600 Fee Conversion
Table, attached hereto as Attachment One.
(Ord. 616 § 4(b), 1999; Ord. 758 §5 (part),
2007)
G. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Chapter, for public
projects owned or operated by the Ripon
Consolidated Fire District, such project(s)
shall be exempt from all City of Ripon
development impact fees and inspection
fees, except that where inspections are
performed by third party inspectors, any
fees incurred by the City shall be
reimbursed by the Ripon Consolidated Fire
District. (Ord. 812, 2014)
H. Developed residential properties
(that is, parcels which are partially or fully
developed with one or more residential
dwelling units at the time of annexation)
which are annexed into the City and are
subsequently required under the Ripon
Municipal Code to connect to city water
and/or city sewer service, or which request
to so connect, shall pay the applicable fees
and charges and otherwise comply with
this Chapter and Resolution 99-24, as
amended from time to time. In the event the
owner or developer of these properties
subsequently apply for discretionary land
use permit(s) for modification, further
development, expansion or some other
change of use, as determined by the
Director, the Fees set forth in this Title 17
which were not previously imposed and/or
collected shall be calculated and imposed
by the City as conditions of approval of
said modification, further development,
expansion or change of use, to the full
extent permitted by law. The requirements
of this subsection “H” may be satisfied by
the execution of an Annexation Agreement
or a Pre-Annexation Development
Agreement between the landowner and the
City, in which the extension of and
connection to city services and the
payment of impact fees associated with the
approval of discretionary land use
permit(s) are addressed. (Ord. 874 § 1,
2018)
I. Developed non-residential
properties (that is, parcels which are
partially or fully developed with one or
more commercial, office or industrial
buildings at the time of annexation) which
are annexed into the City and are
subsequently required under the Ripon
Municipal Code to connect to city water
and/or city sewer service, or which request
to so connect, shall pay the applicable fees
and charges and otherwise comply with
this Chapter and by Resolution, as
amended from time to time. In the event
the owner or developer of these properties
subsequently apply for discretionary land
use permit(s) for modification, further
development, expansion or some other
change of use, as determined by the
Director, the Fees set forth in this Title 17
which were not previously imposed and/or
collected by the City shall be calculated
and imposed by the City as conditions of
approval of said modification, further
development, expansion or change of use
to the full extent permitted by law. The
requirements of this subsection “I” may be
17.16.020
510 (06/20)
satisfied by the execution of an Annexation
Agreement or Pre-Annexation
Development Agreement between the
landowner and the City, in which the
extension of and connection to city
services and the payment of impact fees
associated with the approval of
discretionary land use permit(s) are
addressed. (Ord. 874 § 1, 2018; Ord 898 §
2, 2020)

2. Commercial and Industrial
Buildings. In a building constructed for
more than one tenant or office, each
separate tenant’s office or suite of offices
for a tenant shall be considered to be a unit
D. There shall be no fee imposed on
the remodeling of any building unless it
shall result in the addition of another unit
to the particular building.
E. All sums collected pursuant to this
section shall be placed in a special account
to be used for capital equipment used in
connection with garbage collection in the
city. The above fees shall be listed in the
City Fee Schedule which may be adjusted
by resolution of the city council. Annually,
as of January 1st of each year here-after,
the fee shall be adjusted to reflect any
increase or decrease as shown in the
Engineering News Record Index published
and in effect on July 1st of each year
hereafter. The estimated necessary income
and the expenses of the various projects
contemplated and affected by this garbage
collection capital fee is as set forth in the
Report of the Council Committee RE
AB1600, dated December 23, 1988, filed
with the city clerk. (Ord. 412 § 7, 1989;
Ord. 347 § 4, 1985; Ord. 294 § 2(i), 1980;
Ord. 758 §5 (part), 2007; Ord. 898 § 2,

17.16.040 Fee for Processing
The City Council may adopt, by
resolution, a schedule of fees for staff
processing, including outside engineering
and legal services, as appropriate, to be
paid by the owner or applicant for a
development project, where the permit
application fee will not, in the sole
discretion of the Director, fully defray the
costs associated with processing the
application. (Ord. 294 § 2 (d), 1980; Ord.
758 §5 (part), 2007)
17.16.050 Deposit to guarantee
installation.
At the sole discretion of the
engineering supervisor, the owner, builder
or developer of any real property other than
that contained in a subdivision, as defined
in the subdivision ordinance of the city,
shall guarantee the installation of or shall
pay a deposit to the city sufficient to cover
the actual cost at the time of development
of the installation of curbs, gutters,
sidewalks and street paving. The type of
installation, and the amount of any such
deposit or other guarantee, shall be as
determined by the city engineer. The
guarantee of the installation of these
improvements or the deposit, as the case
may be, shall apply to, be charged to, and
17.16.050
511 (06/20)
paid by the owner, builder on, or
developer of, any real property sought to be
annexed to the city prior to its actual
annexation, and shall also apply to, be
charged to and paid by the owner, builder
on, or developer of, any real property
already situated within the city, sought to
be improved or developed in any manner,
which presently does not already have
curbs, gutters, sidewalks and street paving.
In the case of any lot, parcel or acreage of
real property already situated within the
city, the guarantee of the installation of
these improvements, or the payment of the
deposit covering the cost of any such
installation as required that exceed one
thousand dollars in value as estimated by
the city engineering department, shall be
paid prior to the issuance of any building
permit or other necessary authorization
required to be given by the city in
connection with any such improvements
sought to be made on the real property. For
improvements that do not exceed one
thousand dollars as estimated by the city
engineering department, the owner, builder
or developer shall not be required to post a
deposit for these improvements prior to the
issuance of a building permit. In those
cases where the owner, builder or
developer chooses not to post a deposit
guaranteeing installation of the
improvements, the city building
department shall only conduct building
inspections up to and including the
foundation inspection. All subsequent
inspections will not be made until all
improvements are completed to the city
standards therefore. The above fee shall be
included in the City Fee Schedule which
may be adjusted by resolution of the city
council. The improvement cap shall be
adjusted annually as of January 1st of each
year hereafter to reflect any increase or
decrease as shown in the Engineering
News Record Index published and in effect
on July 1st of each year hereafter. The city
council, for good cause shown, shall have
the right to waive or modify any or all of
the requirements of this section should they
so determine, where special circumstances
exist to justify such action. (Ord. 412 § 8,

1986; Ord. 294 § 2(g), 1980; Ord. 758 §5
(part), 2007)
17.16.080 Pro rata acreage fee.
Whenever any fees as set forth in this
chapter are charged on an acreage basis,

of the home on the smaller lot or parcel of
land. The fee to be paid shall be fixed as
the smaller lot or parcel=s proportionate
share of the total subdivision and sanitary
annexation fees for the total real property
then in effect, determined by using the
front footage of the smaller lot or parcel of
land, multiplied by one hundred feet or the
actual depth of the lot or smaller parcel of
land on which the home is located,
whichever is the greater.
B. All remaining fees, including
annexation and sanitary sewer service,
which may be due and payable for the

business is operated. City staff shall
determine the fee to be paid which shall be
17.16.100
512-2 (06/20)
fixed as the smaller lot, parcel, or portion
of land's proportionate share of the total
annexation and benefit district fees for the
total real property then in effect,
determined by using the front footage of
the smaller lot, parcel, or portion of land,
multiplied by 100 feet or the actual depth
of the lot, parcel, or portion of land on
which the business or commercial
enterprise is then located, whichever is the
greater. However, if either city water or
sanitary sewer service is being used in
connection with the commercial or
industrial enterprise or business on the
smaller lot, parcel, or portion of the land at
the time of annexation, all such fees shall
be immediately due and payable.
B. In the case of expansion of existing
commercial or industrial enterprises or
business, where City staff determines that
the expansion will result in the build-out of
50% or less of the lot or parcel of land or
acreage, including required setbacks and
other dedications, the property owner shall
be charged a pro rata share of the
annexation and benefit fees based on the
amount of acreage covered by the
expansion of the existing business or
industry. The entire amount of annexation
and benefit district fees shall be due and
payable when more than 50% of this lot,
parcel, or acreage is developed.
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section, if the property
owner at any time after annexation elects to
connect to either city sewer services or city
water services, or both, all of the
annexation and benefit district fees
applicable to the entire lot, parcel or
acreage shall be immediately due and
payable prior to the connection to and use
of city sewer or water services. The
property owner may apply to the City
Council for a postponement of the payment
of fees upon a showing or special
circumstances. (Ord. 516 § 1, 1994; Ord.
758 §5 (part), 2007)

Declaration of Intent.
A. In order to implement the goals and
objectives of the General Plan and to mitigate
impacts caused by new development within the
County of San Joaquin, a County Facilities Fee
Program is necessary. The program is needed to
finance region serving Capital Facilities located
throughout the County that are used by the residents
and businesses within the City and to assure that
new development pays its proportional share for
these improvements.
B. Fee revenue collected pursuant to this
ordinance shall be remitted to the County of San
Joaquin who shall be responsible for administering
the fee funds and constructing the Capital Facilities.
C. Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 5, Section
66000 et seq. of the California Government Code
provides that Capital Facilities Fees may be enacted
and imposed on development projects. The City
Council finds and determines that:
1. New development projects cause the need
for construction, expansion, or improvement of
Capital Facilities within the County of San Joaquin.
2. Funds for construction, expansion, or
improvement of Capital Facilities are not available
to accommodate demand for service caused by
development projects; which results in inadequate
Capital Facilities within San Joaquin County.
D. The City Council finds that the health,
safety, peace, morals, convenience, comfort,
prosperity, and general welfare of the residents and
businesses within the City will be promoted by the
adoption of County Facilities Fees for construction,
expansion, or improvement of region serving Capital
Facilities. (Ord. 718 §1, 2005; Ord. 758 §5 (part),
2007)
17.20.020 Collection of Capital Facility Fee.
The Capital Facility Fee enacted pursuant to this
Chapter are to be collected by the City before the
issuance of building permits, or at approval of any
discretionary permit if no building permit is
required. (Ord. 718 §1, 2005; Ord. 758 §5 (part),
2007)
17.20.030 Authority For Adoption.
