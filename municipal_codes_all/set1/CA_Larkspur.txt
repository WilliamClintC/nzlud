CONFLICT OF INTEREST CODE
(Regulations of the Fair Political Practices Commission, Title 2, Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations)

(a) Incorporation by reference of the terms of this regulation along with the designation of employees and the formulation of disclosure categories in the Appendix referred to below constitute the adoption and promulgation of a conflict of interest code within the meaning of Government Code Section 87300 or the amendment of a conflict of interest code within the meaning of Government Code Section 87306 if the terms of this regulation are substituted for terms of a conflict of interest code already in effect. A code so amended or adopted and promulgated requires the reporting of reportable items in a manner substantially equivalent to the requirements of Article 2 of Chapter 7 of the Political Reform Act, Government Code Section 81000 et seq. The requirements of a conflict of interest code are in addition to other requirements of the Political Reform Act, such as the general prohibition against conflicts of interest contained in Government Code Section 87100, and to other state or local laws pertaining to conflicts of interest.
(b) The terms of a conflict of interest code amended or adopted and promulgated pursuant to this regulation are as follows:
(1) Section 1. Definitions. The definitions contained in the Political Reform Act of 1974, regulations of the Fair Political Practices Commission (2 Cal. Code of Regs. Section 18200 et seq.), and any amendments to the Act or regulations, are incorporated by reference into this conflict of interest code.
(2) Section 2. Designated Employees. The persons holding positions listed in the Appendix are designated employees. It has been determined that these persons make or participate in the making of decisions which may foreseeably have a material effect on financial interests.
(3) Section 3. Disclosure Categories. This code does not establish any disclosure obligation for those designated employees who are also specified in Government Code Section 87200 if they are designated in this code in that same capacity or if the geographical jurisdiction of this agency is the same as or is wholly included within the jurisdiction in which those persons must report their financial interests pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 7 of the Political Reform Act, Government Code Sections 87200, et seq.
In addition, this code does not establish any disclosure obligation for any designated employees who are designated in a conflict of interest code for another agency, if all of the following apply:
A) The geographical jurisdiction of this agency is the same as or is wholly included within the jurisdiction of the other agency;
B) The disclosure assigned in the code of the other agency is the same as that required under Article 2 of Chapter 7 of the Political Reform Act, Government Code Section 87200; and
C) The filing officer is the same for both agencies.3
Such persons are covered by this code for disqualification purposes only. With respect to all other designated employees, the disclosure categories set forth in the Appendix specify which kinds of financial interests are reportable. Such a designated employee shall disclose in his or her statement of economic interests those financial interests he or she has which are of the kind described in the disclosure categories to which he or she is assigned in the Appendix. It has been determined that the financial interests set forth in a designated employee’s disclosure categories are the kinds of financial interests which he or she foreseeably can affect materially through the conduct of his or her office.
(4) Section 4. Statements of Economic Interests: Place of Filing. The code reviewing body shall instruct all designated employees within its code to file statements of economic interests with the agency or with the code reviewing body, as provided by the code reviewing body in the agency’s conflict of interest code.4

(5.5) Section 5.5. Statements for Persons Who Resign 30 Days After Appointment. Persons who resign within 30 days of initial appointment are not deemed to have assumed office or left office provided they did not make or participate in the making of, or use their position to influence any decision and did not receive or become entitled to receive any form of payment as a result of their appointment. Such persons shall not file either an assuming or leaving office statement.
(6) Section 6. Contents of and Period Covered by Statements of Economic Interests.

Annual statements shall disclose any reportable investments, interests in real property, income and business positions held or received during the previous calendar year provided, however, that the period covered by an employee’s first annual statement shall begin on the effective date of the code or the date of assuming office whichever is later.

In the case of a voting body, this determination and disclosure shall be made part of the agency’s official record; in the case of a designated employee who is the head of an agency, this determination and disclosure shall be made in writing to his or her appointing authority; and in the case of other designated employees, this determination and disclosure shall be made in writing to the designated employee’s supervisor.

3.08.020 Purpose.
The City Council declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other, purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
A. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State of California;
B. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;
C. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a one percent tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practical to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes;
D. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting City sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1030 § 2(3), 2018; Ord. 284 § 1, 1961; Ord. 231 § 2, 1956)

    2. For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

3.12.020 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:
“Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer or other lodging, including, but not limited to a camping site or a space at a campground or recreational vehicle park at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
“Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.
“Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his function through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
“Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.
“Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel, valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom, whatsoever.
“Tax collector” means the duly authorized and constituted City Treasurer of the City of Larkspur.
“Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 1030 § 2(3), 2018; Ord. 844 § 1, 1993; Ord. 753 § 1, 1987; Ord. 330 § 2, 1966)

3.12.030 Tax Imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten (10) percent of the rent charged by the operator. This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Collector may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Collector. (Ord. 1030 § 2(3), 2018; Ord. 806 § 1, 1990; Ord. 734 § 1, 1986; Ord. 515 § 1, 1974; Ord. 330 § 3, 1966)

3.12.040 Exemptions.
No tax shall be imposed upon:
A. Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax herein provided;
B. Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Tax Collector. (Ord. 1030 § 2(3), 2018; Ord. 330 § 4, 1966)

3.12.050 Operator’s Duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator.

As soon as the Tax Collector shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.

At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 3.12.100.

B. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that incorporates provisions identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
C. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes.
D. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

The Finance Director shall dispose of such surplus property as provided by Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 3.30.040 and 3.30.050. (Ord. 1030 § 2(3), 2018; Ord. 1006 § 1, 2015)

B. In the event the Finance Director rejects any and all such bids so received, he or she shall not thereafter sell such property at a price less than the highest bid which he or she received therefor, until he or she shall first offer such item to the person who submitted the highest bid for such item, at the price bid. In the event such person refuses to purchase such item at such price, the Finance Director may, thereafter, dispose of such property at a lesser price.
C. Sealed Proposal. Provided that the restrictions as to rejecting any and all proposals and thereafter selling the property shall be the same as those for public auctions as set forth in subsection (A) of this section.
D. Incidental sale, as provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 3.30.050.

F. Sale to Another Public Agency. Surplus property may be sold to any other public agency; provided, that the price is determined to be fair and reasonable. Such determination shall be made by the Finance Director for a sale for one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or less, and by the City Council for a sale exceeding one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). “Public agency” means the state or any agency or subdivision thereof, or any city, county, special district, or school district.

    2. Is perishable;
    3. Has been offered for public sale and no offer to purchase has been received; or
    4. Has a nominal estimated value.

C. Nothing in this section shall be read to limit the ability of the Finance Director to sell, as he or she may deem proper, any item as defined in subsection (A) of this section by sale at public auction or by sealed proposal as provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 3.30.040. (Ord. 1030 § 2(3), 2018; Ord. 1006 § 1, 2015)

3.30.060 Distribution of Surplus Property to City Departments.

The department head of any City department may choose any item of such surplus property from such list to be used by that department in the ordinary transaction of the business of such department, and the Finance Director may thereafter transfer such item to such department without offering the same for public sale.

Such identification card shall have affixed to it the picture, fingerprint, general description and signature of the individual to whom issued, and shall contain reference to the issuance and expiration of the license.

5.38.010 Title.
This chapter shall be known as the “Larkspur Tobacco Retail License Ordinance.” (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.020 Purpose.
The Marin County Tobacco Control Program considers local tobacco retail license regulations an effective deterrent to the violation of existing tobacco laws. Tobacco retail license ordinances restrict youth access to tobacco and tobacco products by providing a mechanism for revoking a retailer’s ability to sell tobacco. Additionally, communities are adopting local prohibitions against the sale of flavored tobacco products as a way to further reduce smoking and promote public health. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.030 Definitions.
The following words and phrases, whenever used in this chapter, shall have the meanings defined in this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
“Arm’s length transaction” means a sale in good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects the fair market value between two (2) informed and willing parties, neither of which is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or a sale for which a significant purpose is avoiding the effect of the violations of this chapter is not an arm’s length transaction.
“Characterizing flavor” means a taste or aroma, other than the taste or aroma of tobacco, imparted either prior to or during consumption of a tobacco product or any byproduct produced by the tobacco product, including, but not limited to, tastes or aromas relating to menthol, mint, wintergreen, fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic beverage, herb, or spice; provided, however, that a tobacco product shall not be determined to have a characterizing flavor solely because of the use of additives or flavorings or the provision of ingredient information.
Cigar. 
    1. Any roll of tobacco wrapped entirely or in part in tobacco or in any substance containing tobacco; or
    2. Any paper or wrapper that contains tobacco and is designed for smoking or ingestion of tobacco products.
    3. For the purposes of this definition, “cigar” includes, but is not limited to, tobacco products known or labeled as “cigar,” “cigarillo,” “tiparillo,” “little cigar,” “blunt wrap,” or “cigar wrap.”
“Constituent” means any ingredient, substance, chemical, or compound, other than tobacco, water, or reconstituted tobacco sheet, that is added by the manufacturer to a tobacco product during the processing, manufacture, or packing of the tobacco product.
“Department” means City Manager or designee.
“Distinguishable” means perceivable by either the sense of smell or taste.
“Electronic smoking device” means an electronic device which can be used to deliver an inhaled dose of nicotine, or other substances, including any component, part, or accessory of such a device, whether or not sold separately. “Electronic smoking device” includes any such electronic smoking device, whether manufactured, distributed, marketed, or sold as an electronic cigarette, an electronic cigar, an electronic cigarillo, an electronic pipe, an electronic hookah, or any other product name or descriptor.
“Flavored tobacco product” means any tobacco product that imparts a characterizing flavor.
“Pharmacy” means a retail establishment in which the profession of pharmacy by a pharmacist licensed by the State of California in accordance with the Business and Professions Code is practiced and where prescriptions are offered for sale. A pharmacy may also offer other retail goods in addition to prescription pharmaceuticals.
“Proprietor” means a person with an ownership or managerial interest in a business. An ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a person has a ten percent (10%) or greater interest in the stock, assets, or income of a business other than the sole interest of security for debt. A managerial interest shall be deemed to exist when a person can or does have or share ultimate control over the day-to-day operations of a business.
“Self-service display” means the open display or storage of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in a manner that is physically accessible in any way to the general public without the assistance of the retailer or employee of the retailer and a direct person-to-person transfer between the purchaser and the retailer or employee of the retailer. A vending machine is a form of self-service display.
“Tobacco paraphernalia” means any item designed or marketed for the consumption, use, or preparation of tobacco products.
Tobacco Product. 
    1. Any product containing, made, or derived from tobacco or nicotine that is intended for human consumption, whether smoked, heated, chewed, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other means, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, or any other preparation of tobacco; and
    2. Any electronic device that delivers nicotine or other substances to the person inhaling from the device, including, but not limited to, an electronic cigarette, electronic cigar, electronic pipe, or electronic hookah.
    3. Notwithstanding any provision of subsections (1) and (2) of this definition to the contrary, “tobacco product” includes any component, part, or accessory intended or reasonably expected to be used with a tobacco product, whether or not sold separately, and any product or formulation of matter containing biologically active amounts of nicotine that is manufactured, sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed with the expectation that the product or matter will be introduced into the human body. “Tobacco product” does not include any cessation product specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in treating nicotine or tobacco dependence.
    “Tobacco retailer” means any person who sells, offers for sale, or does or offers to exchange for any form of consideration tobacco, tobacco products, or tobacco paraphernalia. “Tobacco retailing” shall mean the doing of any of these things. This definition is without regard to the quantity of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia sold, offered for sale, exchanged, or offered for exchange. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.040 General Requirements and Prohibitions.
A. Tobacco Retailer’s License Requirement. It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer in the City without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter for each location at which tobacco retailing is to occur. Tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailer’s license is a nuisance as a matter of law.
B. Lawful Business Operation. In the course of tobacco retailing or in the operation of the business or maintenance of the location for which a license is issued, it shall be a violation of this chapter for a licensee, or any of the licensee’s agents or employees, to violate any local, state, or federal law applicable to tobacco products, tobacco paraphernalia, or tobacco retailing.
C. Display of License. Each tobacco retailer license shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the licensed location.
D. Display of Prohibition of Sale to Minors. Tobacco retailers shall post plainly visible signs at the point of purchase of tobacco products which state:THE SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO PERSONS UNDER TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
The letters of said signs should be at least one-quarter (1/4) inch high.
E. Positive Identification Required. No person engaged in tobacco retailing shall sell a tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia to another person who appears to be under the age of twenty-seven (27) years without first examining the identification of the recipient to confirm that the recipient is at least the minimum age for sale of tobacco products as established by state law.
F. Minimum Age for People Selling Tobacco. No person who is younger than twenty-one (21) years of age shall engage in tobacco retailing.
G. Self-Service Displays Prohibited. Tobacco retailing by means of a self-service display is prohibited.
H. False and Misleading Advertising Prohibited. A tobacco retailer without a valid tobacco retailer’s license or a proprietor without a valid tobacco retailer’s license, including, for example, a person whose license has been suspended or revoked:
    1. Shall keep all tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia out of public view. The public display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in violation of this provision shall constitute tobacco retailing without a license under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.38.130 and the retailer shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of such products from the tobacco retailer’s location or that could lead a reasonable consumer to believe that such products can be obtained at that location.
I. Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products Prohibited. No tobacco retailer shall sell a tobacco product containing, as a constituent or additive, an artificial or natural flavor or an herb or spice, including without limitation strawberry, grape, orange, clove, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, licorice, cocoa, chocolate, cherry, coffee, menthol, mint or wintergreen, that is a characterizing flavor of the tobacco product or smoke produced by the tobacco product.
J. Minimum Package Size for Cigars. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it shall be a violation of this section for any licensee or any of the licensee’s agents or employees to sell, offer for sale, or exchange for any form of consideration:
    1. Any single cigar, whether or not packaged for individual sale;
    2. Any number of cigars fewer than the number contained in the manufacturer’s original consumer packaging designed for retail sale to a consumer; or
    3. Any package of cigars containing fewer than five (5) cigars.
This subsection (J) does not apply to the sale or offer for sale of a single cigar for which the retail price exceeds five dollars ($5.00). (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.050 Application Process.
A. An application for a tobacco retailer’s license shall be submitted in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct or conducting retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof. It is the responsibility of each proprietor to be informed regarding all laws applicable to tobacco retailing, including those laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer’s license. No proprietor may rely on the issuance of a license as a determination by the City that the proprietor has complied with all laws applicable to tobacco retailing. A license issued contrary to this chapter, contrary to any other law, or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.38.120(C). Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to vest in any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right to act as a tobacco retailer in contravention of any provision of law.
B. All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the Department and shall contain the following information:
    1. The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor of the business seeking a license.
    2. The business name, address, and telephone number of the single fixed location for which a license is sought.
    3. A single name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to receive all communications and notices (the “authorized person and address”) required by, authorized by, or convenient to the enforcement of this chapter. If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section.
    4. Proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer’s license is sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer’s license by the California Board of Equalization.
    5. Such other information as the Department deems necessary for the administration or enforcement of this chapter as specified on the application form required by this section.
C. A licensed tobacco retailer shall inform the Department in writing of any change in the information submitted on an application for a tobacco retailer’s license within ten (10) business days of a change.
D. All information specified in an application pursuant to this section shall be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (California Government Code Section 6250 et seq.) or any other applicable law, subject to the law’s exemptions. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.060 Issuance of License.
A. Bases for Denial of License. Upon the receipt of a complete application for a tobacco retailer’s license and the license fee required by this chapter, the Department shall issue a license unless substantial evidence demonstrates that one or more of the following bases for denial exists:
    1. The information presented in the application is inaccurate or false. Intentionally supplying inaccurate or false information shall be a violation of this chapter;
    2. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a location for which this chapter prohibits a licensed to be issued. However, this subsection shall not constitute a basis for denial of a license if the applicant provides the City with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an arm’s length transaction;
    3. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a proprietor to whom this chapter prohibits a license to be issued;
    4. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a location that is unlawful pursuant to this code, including, without limitation, a provision of a zoning ordinance or building code, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other law.
B. Appeal of Denial of License. Subject to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.38.120(B), a decision of the Department to deny a license is appealable to the City Council under Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 2.50.
C. Pharmacies Cannot Sell Tobacco Products. No license may be issued to authorize tobacco retailing in a pharmacy, and no pharmacy shall engage in tobacco retailing at any time. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.070 License Renewal and Expiration.
A. Renewal of License. A tobacco retailer’s license is invalid if the appropriate fee has not been timely paid in full or if the term of the license has expired. The term of a tobacco retailer’s license is one calendar year. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of their tobacco retailer’s license and submit the license fee no later than January 1st of each year and annually thereafter.
B. Expiration of License. A tobacco retailer’s license that is not timely renewed shall expire on December 31st of each year. To renew a license not timely renewed pursuant to subsection (A) of this section, the proprietor must:
    1. Submit the license fee and the renewal form; and
    2. Submit a signed affidavit affirming that the proprietor has not sold and will not sell any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia after the license expiration date and before the license is renewed. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.080 Transfer Restrictions.
A. A tobacco retailer’s license may not be transferred from one location to another.
B. A new tobacco retailer’s license is required whenever a tobacco retailing location has a change in proprietor(s).
C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, prior violations at a location shall continue to be counted against a location and license ineligibility periods shall continue to apply to a location unless the new proprietor(s) provide the Department with clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor(s) have acquired or are acquiring the location in an arm’s length transaction. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.090 License Conveys a Limited, Conditional Privilege.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right other than the limited conditional privilege to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the City identified on the face of the license. For example, nothing in this section shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of any other provision of applicable law, including, but not limited to, any provision of this code including, without limitation, the zoning ordinance and building codes, or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place of employment pursuant to California Labor Code Section 6404.5. For example, obtaining a tobacco retailer’s license does not make the retailer a “retail or wholesale tobacco shop” for the purposes of California Labor Code Section 6404.5. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.100 Fee for License.
The fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer’s license shall be established from time to time by resolution of the City Council. The fee shall be calculated so as to recover the cost of administration and enforcement of this chapter, including, for example, issuing a license, administering the license program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violations, and prosecution of violators, but shall not exceed the cost of the regulatory program authorized by this chapter. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.110 Compliance Monitoring.
A. Compliance with this chapter shall be monitored by the Department. In addition, any peace officer may enforce the penal provisions of this chapter. The Department may designate any number of additional persons to monitor compliance with this chapter.
B. The Department will work with the Marin County Tobacco Control Program to inspect each tobacco retailer at least one time per twelve-month period. Nothing in this subsection shall create a right of action in any licensee or other person against the City or its agents. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.120 Suspension or Revocation of License.
A. Suspension or Revocation of License for Violation. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer’s license shall be suspended or revoked if any court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the Department finds based on a preponderance of the evidence, after the licensee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that the licensee, or any of the licensee’s agents or employees, has violated any of the requirements, conditions, or prohibitions of this chapter or has pleaded guilty, “no contest” or its equivalent, or admitted to a violation of any law designated in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.38.040.
    1. Upon a finding by the Department of a first violation, the tobacco retailer will be issued a warning.
    2. Upon a finding by the Department of a second violation of this chapter at a location within any sixty-month period, the license shall be suspended for thirty (30) days.
    3. Upon a finding by the Department of a third violation of this chapter at a location within any sixty-month period, the license shall be suspended for ninety (90) days.
    4. Upon a finding by the Department of a fourth violation of this chapter at a location within any sixty-month period, the license shall be suspended for one year. Upon a finding by the Department of five (5) or more violations of this chapter at a location within any sixty-month period, the license shall be revoked.
B. Appeal of Suspension or Revocation. A Department decision to suspend or revoke a license is appealable under Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 2.50. If such an appeal is timely made, it shall stay enforcement of the appealed action. An appeal to the City Council is not available for a revocation made pursuant to subsection (C) of this section.
C. Revocation of License Wrongly Issued. A tobacco retailer’s license shall be revoked if the Department finds, after the licensee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a license under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.38.060 existed at the time the application was submitted or at any time before the license issued. The decision by the Department shall be the final decision of the City. Such a revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new license application.
D. Judicial Action. Any final administrative action to suspend or revoke a tobacco retailer’s license under this section shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to California Government Code Section 53069.4, which, among other things, requires such a judicial challenge to be brought within twenty (20) days of service of the final decision. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.130 Tobacco Retailing without a Valid License.
A. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the City Council finds based on a preponderance of evidence, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, that any person has engaged in tobacco retailing at a location without a valid tobacco retailer’s license, either directly or through the person’s agents or employees, the person shall be ineligible to apply for, or to be issued, a tobacco retailer’s license as follows:
    1. After a first violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new license may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until thirty (30) days have passed from the date of the violation.
    2. After a second violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new license may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until ninety (90) days have passed from the date of the violation.
    3. After a third or subsequent violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new license may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until sixty (60) months have passed from the date of the violation.
B. Tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia offered for sale or exchange in violation of this section are subject to seizure by the Department or any peace officer and shall be forfeited after the licensee and any other owner of the tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia seized are given reasonable notice and an opportunity to demonstrate that the tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia were not offered for sale or exchange in violation of this section. The decision by the Department may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.38.120(B). Forfeited tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia shall be destroyed after all internal appeals have been exhausted and the time in which to seek judicial review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 or other applicable law has expired without the filing of a lawsuit or, if such a suit is filed, after judgment in that suit becomes final.
C. For the purposes of the civil remedies provided in this section, each of the following constitutes a separate violation of this section:
    1. Each day on which a tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia is offered for sale in violation of this section; or
    2. Each individual retail tobacco product and each individual retail item of tobacco paraphernalia that is distributed, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this section. (Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

5.38.140 Additional Remedies.
A. The remedies provided by this chapter are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.

(Ord. 1037 § 2, 2019)

Ordinance No. 731 provides that the City of Larkspur has entered into an agreement with Viacom Cablevision dated February 5, 1986, authorizing Viacom Cablevision to provide community antenna television services within the City.

5.44.010 Community Antenna Television System Franchise.
A nonexclusive franchise to construct, operate and maintain a community antenna television system within all or any portion of the City may be granted by the City Council to any person, firm or corporation, whether operating under an existing franchise or not, who or which offers to furnish and provide such system under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter.
No provision of this chapter shall be deemed or construed so as to require the granting of a franchise when, in the opinion of the Council, it is in the public interest to restrict the number of grantees to one or more. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words, abbreviations and their derivations shall have the meaning given in this section:
“CATV” means a community antenna television system as hereinafter defined.
“City” means the City of Larkspur.
“Community antenna television system” means a system of antenna, coaxial cables, wires, wave guides, or other conductors, equipment or facilities designed, constructed or used for the purpose of providing television or FM radio service by cable or through its facilities as herein contemplated. (To the extent that the Federal Communications Commission has preempted the same, CATV shall not mean or include the transmission of any special program or event for which a separate and distinct charge is made to the subscriber in the manner commonly known and referred to as “pay television.”)
“Franchise” means and includes any authorization granted under this chapter in terms of a franchise, privilege, permit, license or otherwise to construct, operate and maintain a CATV system in the City. Any such authorization, in whatever term granted, shall not mean and include any license or permit required for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the City in accordance with the business license ordinances of the City.
“Grantee” means the person, firm or corporation to whom or which a franchise is granted by the Council under this chapter, and the lawful successor, transferee or assignee of said person, firm or corporation.
“Gross subscriber receipts” is the basis for computing the franchise fee and is meant to include gross revenues from all cable services, including revenues derived from the supplying of regular subscriber service, installation, disconnect, reconnect and relocation charges, as well as revenues derived from per-program or per-channel charges, leased channel revenues, advertising revenues, and any other income derived from the system.
“Property of grantee” means all property owned, installed or used by a grantee in the City under the authority of a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter.
“Street” means the surface of and the space above and below any public street, road, highway, freeway, lane, path, alley, court, sidewalk, parkway, or drive, now or hereafter existing as such within the City.
“Subscriber” means any person or entity receiving or entitled to receive the CATV service of a grantee. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 590 § 1, 1978; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.030 Uses Permitted by Grantee.
Any nonexclusive franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall authorize and permit the grantee to engage in the business of operating and providing a CATV system in the City, and for that purpose, to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along any public street such poles, wires, cable conductors, ducts, conduit, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, attachments and other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the CATV system; except as otherwise may be required by the provisions of this chapter with specific reference to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.44.090 and, in addition, so to use, operate and provide similar facilities or properties, rented or leased from persons, firms or corporations including, but not limited to, any public utility or other grantee franchised or permitted to do business in the City.
The grantee may make a charge to subscribers for installation and connection to its CATV system and a fixed monthly charge as filed and approved as provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.44.200, to the end that the franchisee shall be allowed a reasonable profit.
No increase in the rates and charges to subscribers, as set forth in the schedule filed and approved with the grantee’s application, may be made without the prior approval of the Council expressed by resolution. At the time of the franchise review provided for in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.44.220, the Council shall have the right to require the reduction of the monthly subscription charge to subscribers when, after a rate analysis study is made of operations within the City, it appears that such reduction is justified. Such rate analysis study shall be performed by an independent qualified person or firm designated by the City and paid for by the franchisee.
No permission or license is given to enter private property without the express consent of the owner or the agent in possession thereof.
The franchisee shall carry on its operations in a good, ethical, and businesslike manner at all times. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.040 Duration of Franchise.
No franchise granted by the City Council under this chapter shall be for a term longer than fifteen (15) years following the date of acceptance of such franchise by the grantee or the renewal thereof. Any such franchise granted under this chapter may be terminated prior to its date of expiration by the City Council in the event that said Council has found, after notice of the proposed termination and public hearing, as follows:
A. The grantee has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, or has, by act or omission, violated any material term or condition of any franchise or permit issued under this chapter; or
B. Any provision of this chapter has become invalid or unenforceable, and the Council further finds that such provision constituted a consideration material to the grant of said franchise; provided, however, that the grantee shall be given at least thirty (30) days’ notice of any proposed termination proceedings, by mail to the last known address of the grantee; or
C. The City acquires the CATV system property of the grantee; or
D. The grantee has failed to provide adequate service under the terms of this chapter or any condition of the franchise. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.050 Franchise Payment.
Any grantee granted a franchise under this chapter shall pay to the City, during the life of such franchise, and at times hereinafter specified in this chapter, a sum equal to three (3) percent of the monthly total gross subscriber receipts of the grantee, or such other sum as the City Council may establish from time to time. Such payment by the grantee to the City shall be in lieu of any occupation tax, license tax, or similar levy but shall not excuse the grantee from obtaining said business license or other permit required by law. Such payment by the grantee to the City shall be made monthly, or as otherwise provided in the grantee’s franchise, by delivery of the same to the City Clerk.
The grantee shall file with the City, within thirty (30) days after the expiration of each calendar year or portion thereof during which such franchise is in force, a financial statement prepared by a certified public accountant showing in detail the total gross subscriber receipts of the grantee, its successors or assigns during the preceding calendar year or portion thereof. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay to the City, within fifteen (15) days after the time for filing such statement, any unpaid balance for the calendar year covered by such statement. In any month or portion thereof commencing with the beginning of the first year following the effective date of said franchise during which payments under this section amount to less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month, the grantee shall pay the City as a minimum an amount equal to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.
The City shall have the right to inspect the grantee’s books, records, and accounts showing the gross subscriber receipts from which its franchise payments are computed, and the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under this chapter. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation under this chapter.
In the event of any holding over after expiration or other termination of any franchise granted under this chapter without the consent of the City, the grantee shall pay to the City reasonable damages as may be provided by law, the same to be in addition to any other legal remedies the City may have. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.060 Limitations of Franchise.
The following limitations shall apply to any franchise granted within the City:
A. Any franchise granted under this chapter shall be nonexclusive.
B. No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred by any franchise granted under this chapter except as specifically prescribed in this chapter.
C. Any privilege claimed under such franchise by the grantee in any street or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the streets or other public property and shall be in conformance with Government Code Section 53066 and other applicable provisions of law.
D. Any such franchise shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by the original grantee. It cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned, or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, without the prior consent of the Council expressed by resolution, and then only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed. Any such transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk within thirty (30) days after any such transfer or assignment. The proposed assignee must show financial responsibility and must agree to comply with the provisions of this chapter and all conditions and requirements of the franchise being transferred; provided, further, that no such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation as a whole to secure an indebtedness. The Council may impose a fee of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00)  to cover all expenses of the City incurred in investigating the financial status and ability of the proposed transferee. It is the intention of the Council to prevent the peddling of any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter after the award thereof. No consent to the transfer of said franchise shall be granted by the Council unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Council that the grantee has in good faith proceeded to install the CATV system and that only unusual or extraordinary circumstances prevent said grantee from operating the system, or that other satisfactory reason exists for such transfer. Where a grantee of a franchise seeks consent of the Council to a transfer of said franchise prior to the installation of a substantial portion of the system, the Council may, at its discretion, refuse to consent to such transfer and it may award a new franchise in the same manner as the original franchise was issued. The consents provided for herein shall not be unreasonably withheld.
E. Time shall be of the essence of any such franchise granted under this chapter. The grantee shall not be relieved of his obligation to comply promptly with any of the provisions of this chapter by any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance.
F. Any right or power in, or duty impressed upon, any officer, employee, department or board of the City shall be subject to transfer by the City to any other officer, employee, department or board of the City.
G. The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of or relating to any provision or requirement of this chapter or of any franchise issued under this chapter because of its enforcement.
H. Any such franchise granted shall not relieve the grantee of any obligation involved in obtaining pole space from any department of the City, utility company, or from others maintaining poles in streets.
I. As between grantee and the City, any and all construction, operation and maintenance by any CATV franchisee in the City shall be deemed and construed to be under and pursuant to said franchise and not under or pursuant to any other right, privilege, power, immunity or authority of the City. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.070 Rights Reserved to the City.
The following rights are specifically reserved to the City and are not deemed to be waived by any franchise issued under this chapter:
A. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect in any way, to any extent, the right of the City to acquire the property of the grantee, either by purchase or through the exercise of the right of eminent domain, at a fair and just value, which shall not include any amount for the franchise itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted, and nothing herein contained shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity the City’s right of eminent domain.
B. Neither the granting of any franchise under this chapter nor any provision contained herein shall be construed to prevent the City from granting any identical or similar franchise to any other person, firm or corporation within all or any portion of the City.
C. Neither the granting of any franchise or any provision hereof shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the City heretofore or hereafter enacted or established.
D. The Council may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may determine any question of fact which may arise during the existence of any franchise granted under this chapter. The City Manager is authorized and empowered to adjust, settle or compromise any controversy or charge arising from the operations of any grantee under this chapter, either on behalf of the City, the grantee, or any subscriber. Either the grantee or any member of the public who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the City Manager may appeal the matter to the Council for hearing and determination. The Council may accept, reject or modify the decision of the City Manager and the Council may adjust, settle or compromise any controversy arising from the operation of any grantee or from any provision of this chapter.
E. There is reserved to the City the power to amend any part of this chapter so as to require additional or greater standards of construction, operation or maintenance to conform to then current standards, and the grantee shall thereupon comply with such amendment as the Council shall direct.
F. In connection with the issuance of any franchise under this chapter, the City Council may impose such reasonable restrictions, conditions and limitations as to the area or areas of the City to be served by said franchise holder, operating conditions and cooperative working arrangements relative to local television broadcasting stations serving the City with the best possible television reception. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.080 Permits, Installation and Service.
A. Within sixty (60) days after acceptance of any franchise, the grantee shall have completed all applications to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business, including, but not limited to, any utility joint use attachment agreements, microwave carrier licenses, and any other permits, licenses and authorizations to be granted by duly constituted regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the operation of CATV systems or their associated microwave transmission facilities.
B. The grantee shall, within three (3) months after the effective date of the franchise agreement, prepare and submit to the City Council for approval plans and specifications for the installation of the system.
C. The grantee shall complete the installation of all trunk and distribution lines within a period of one year following approval by the City Council of the plans and specifications.
D. The grantee shall connect lateral lines to homes desiring service as it proceeds with construction. Said service shall be furnished within thirty (30) days following availability of such service.
E. Within ninety (90) days after obtaining all necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the grantee shall commence construction and installation of the CATV system.
F. Within ninety (90) days after the commencement of construction and installation of the system, the grantee shall proceed to render service to subscribers, and the completion of the construction and installation shall be pursued with reasonable diligence thereafter, so that service to all areas designated on the map accompanying the application for franchise shall be provided within one year from the date that service was first provided.
G. Failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set forth in this section shall be grounds for termination of such franchise; provided, however, that the Council in its discretion may extend the time for the commencement and completion of construction and installation for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond his control.
H. For systems already constructed, the grantee must have accomplished significant construction and have equitably extended energized trunk cable to substantially serve all of the franchise area. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.090 Location of Grantee’s Properties.
A. Any poles, wires, cable lines, conduits or other properties of the grantee to be constructed or installed in streets shall be so constructed or installed only at such locations and in such manner as shall be approved by the City Engineer acting in the exercise of his reasonable discretion. The Council may, in its discretion, require that all community antenna television lines and amplifiers be placed beneath the surface of the ground, provided the cost thereof is reflected in subscriber rates to the end that the grantee shall not be deprived of its right to a reasonable profit.
B. The grantee shall not, without first obtaining the written approval of the City Manager, install or erect any facilities or apparatus in or on other public property, places or rights-of-way, or within any privately owned area within the City which has not yet become a public street but is designated or delineated as a proposed public street on any tentative subdivision map approved by the City, except those installed or erected upon public utility facilities now existing.
C. In those areas and portions of the City where the transmission or distribution facilities of the public utilities providing telephone and electric service are underground or hereafter may be placed underground, the grantee shall immediately construct or reconstruct, operate, relocate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground, except that for new structures, the builder or developer will provide and install at his sole cost and expense, to the grantee’s current specifications, trenches for underground distribution, service laterals, service drop trenches to the buildings’ points of entry, and backfill and restoration of trench area; conduit, vaults and pedestals, and internal wiring. Grantee’s amplifiers and essential connections thereto may be in appropriate housing above the surface of the ground as approved by the City Engineer. The City shall not in any manner be responsible for any costs incurred by the grantee in placing this property underground.
To ensure that cable television service is available under these provisions, the builder or developer will provide the City with plans for inclusion of cable television service with his plans for utilities including telephone, electrical and gas service prior to obtaining a City building permit. The builder or developer will also include proof that a contractual agreement exists between the builder or developer and the grantee, which is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
Provided the contractor or developer has fulfilled his contractual commitments to the grantee, the grantee shall make cable television service available to such new structure or structures when ready for occupancy, unless otherwise extended by the City Manager. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.100 Removal or Abandonment of Property of Grantee.
A. In the event that the use of any part of the CATV system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of six (6) months, or in the event such system or property or any part thereof has been installed without complying with the requirements of its franchise, or the franchise has been terminated, cancelled or has expired, the grantee, upon being given notice, shall promptly commence and diligently pursue to conclusion within not more than six (6) months the removal of all such property and poles of such system other than any which the City Manager may permit to be abandoned in such place. In the event of any such removal, the grantee shall promptly restore the area from which such property has been removed to a condition satisfactory to the City Engineer.
B. Any property of the grantee remaining in place after the time provided in subsection (A) of this section shall be deemed permanently abandoned at the option of the City Manager.
C. Any property of the grantee to be abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such manner as the City Manager prescribes. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of the grantee in place and upon acceptance thereof by the City, the property shall become that of the City, and the grantee shall submit to the City Manager an instrument in writing, to be approved by the City Attorney, transferring ownership of such property to the City. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.110 Change Required by Public Improvements.
The grantee shall, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the same street or other public place, or remove from the street or other public place any property of the grantee when required by the City Manager by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power or signal lines, and tracks or any other type of structures or improvements by public agencies when acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity, or any other structures or public improvements; provided, however, the grantee shall in all such cases have the privileges and be subject to the obligation to abandon any property of the grantee in place, as provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 5.44.100. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.120 Failure to Perform Street Work.
Upon failure of the grantee to commence, diligently pursue, or complete any work required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or by its franchise to be done in any street or other public place, within the time prescribed, and to the satisfaction of the City Manager, the City Manager may, after written notice, at his option, cause such work to be done and the grantee shall forthwith pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the City Manager to the grantee within thirty (30) days after receipt of such itemized report. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.130 CATV Installation Shielding.
The grantee shall at all times during the term of any franchise granted under this chapter, at its own cost and expense, properly and in good and workmanlike manner, install and maintain adequate shielding, filtering and grounding at affected installations within the CATV system to eliminate television interference encountered from fundamental frequency overload by radio amateur transmissions which are in compliance with Federal Communications Commission regulations. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.140 Faithful Performance Bond.
A. The grantee shall, concurrently with the filing of and acceptance of award of any franchise granted under this chapter, file with the City Clerk and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the term of such franchise or any renewal thereof, at grantee’s sole expense, a corporate surety bond in an amount to be determined by the City Council, with and in a form approved by the City Attorney, renewable annually, and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the grantee, and upon the further condition that in the event the grantee fails to comply with any one or more of the provisions of this chapter or of any franchise issued to the grantee under this chapter, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result thereof, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee as prescribed by this chapter which may be in default, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney’s fees and costs, said condition to be a continuing obligation for the duration of such franchise and any renewal thereof and thereafter until the grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with the City that may have arisen from the acceptance of said franchise or renewal by the grantee or from its exercise of any privilege therein granted. The bond shall provide that thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of intention not to renew, cancellation, or material change be given to the City.
B. Neither the provisions of this section, nor any bond accepted by the City pursuant to this section, nor any damages recovered by the City thereunder shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under any franchise issued under this chapter or for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.150 Indemnification of the City.
A. The grantee shall, concurrently with the filing of an acceptance of award of any franchise granted under this chapter, furnish to the City and file with the City Clerk and at all times during the existence of any franchise granted under this chapter maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, a general comprehensive liability insurance policy, in protection of the City, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, in a company and a form satisfactory to the City Attorney protecting the City and all persons against liability for loss or damage for personal injury, death, defamation, and property damage occasioned by the operations of the grantee under such franchise, with minimum liability limits of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) for personal injury, death, or defamation of any one person, and one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) for personal injury, death, or defamation of two (2) or more persons in any one occurrence, and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for damage to property resulting from any one occurrence.
B. The policies mentioned in subsection (A) of this section shall name the City, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees as additional insureds and shall contain a provision that a written notice of cancellation, termination, or reduction in coverage of said policy shall be delivered to the City at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date thereof; if such insurance is provided by a policy which also covers the grantee or any other entity or person other than those above named, then such policy shall contain the standard cross-liability endorsement.
C. No franchise granted under this chapter shall be effective unless and until each of the foregoing policies of insurance as required in this section has been delivered to the City, but failure to deliver the same shall not relieve the grantee from any duty or obligation under this chapter. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.160 Inspection of Property and Records.
A. At all reasonable times, the grantee shall permit any duly authorized representative of the City to examine all property of the grantee, together with any appurtenant property of the grantee situated within or without the City, and to examine and transcribe any and all maps and other records kept or maintained by the grantee or under its control which deal with the operations, affairs, transactions or property of the grantee with respect to its franchise. If any such maps or records are not kept in the City, or upon reasonable request not made available in the City, and if the Council determines that an examination thereof is necessary or appropriate, then all travel and maintenance expenses necessarily incurred in making such examination shall be paid by the grantee.
B. The grantee shall prepare and furnish to the City Manager and the City Clerk at the time and in the form prescribed by either of said officers such reports with respect to its operations, affairs, transactions or property, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of the rights, functions or duties of the City or any of its officers, in connection with the franchise.
C. The grantee shall at all times make and keep available to the City full and complete plans and records showing the exact location of all CATV system equipment installed or in use in streets and other public places in the City. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.170 Operational Standards.
The CATV system shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the highest and best applicable accepted standards of the industry and the Federal Communications Commission to the effect that subscribers shall at all times receive the highest possible service.
In the event unresolved complaints or other evidence under such circumstances as the City has reasonable grounds to believe that tests should be performed concerning the standard or quality of the services rendered, the City may engage the services of a qualified consultant at the expense of the grantee. The report of the consultant shall be binding upon the City, the subscriber and the grantee. The grantee shall promptly comply with all recommendations of the consultant. (Ord. 1030 § 2(4), 2018; Ord. 549 § 1 (part), 1976)

5.44.180 Miscellaneous Provisions.
A. When not otherwise prescribed in this chapter, all matters required to be filed with the City shall be filed with the City Clerk.
B. The grantee shall pay to the City a sum of money sufficient to reimburse the City for all publication and reasonable administrative expenses incurred by it in connection with the granting of a franchise pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Such payment shall be made to the City Clerk within thirty (30) days after the City furnishes the grantee with a written statement of such expenses.
C. No person, firm or corporation in the existing service area of the grantee shall be refused service; provided, however, that the grantee shall not be required to provide service to any subscriber who does not pay the applicable connection fee or monthly service charge.
D. The franchise holder shall not engage in the business of selling television or other receivers which make use of signals transmitted by the franchised system, nor shall the franchise holder engage in the repair of such receivers or sale of parts for the same.
E. If the grantee fails to operate its system for a period of two (2) years from the date such service begins, the subscribers who have paid installation charges shall be entitled to a refund of the installation charges less one-twenty-fourth of each charge for each month elapsing from the time service was first started to that subscriber and during which time service was available to him.

    3. A description, in detail, of the public streets, public places and proposed public streets within which the applicant proposes or seeks authority to construct, install or maintain any CATV equipment or facilities; a detailed description of the equipment or facilities proposed to be constructed, installed or maintained therein, and the proposed specific locations thereof;

    5. A statement or schedule in a form approved by the City Manager of proposed rates and charges to subscribers for installation and services, and a copy of the proposed service agreement between the grantee and its subscribers shall accompany the application. For unusual circumstances, such as underground cable required, or more than one hundred fifty (150) feet of distance from existing subscriber tap to structure point of entry, an additional installation charge over that normally charged for installation as specified in the applicant’s proposal may be charged, with easements to be supplied by subscribers.

E. The grantee shall be required to provide continuous service to all subscribers in return for payment of the established fee. If the grantee overbuilds, rebuilds, modifies or sells the system, or the City revokes or fails to renew this franchise, the grantee is required to continue to operate the system until an orderly change of operation is effectuated, unless relieved from doing so by the City Council.

Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an owner and/or occupant of a residential or commercial premises from making occasional disposals at an authorized disposal site in addition to their regular weekly service, or from utilizing a temporary debris box service, consistent with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 6.08.030(E).
B. Dumping or Burying. No person shall dump, place or bury in any lot, land or street or alley within the City any solid waste, without first having obtained a solid waste facilities permit or exemption from that permit issued by the Local Enforcement Agency (LEA) of Marin County and concurred with by the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). Under no circumstances whatsoever shall recyclable materials be dumped, placed, or buried, as above.
C. Accumulation. No person owning or occupying any building, lot or premises within the City shall allow any solid waste to accumulate or remain in or upon said building, lot or premises, in a manner that creates a public nuisance. The owner of any premises, business establishment, industry, or other property, vacant or occupied, shall be responsible for the safe and sanitary storage of all solid waste accumulated on the property. Containers shall be filled in a manner that prevents the contents from overflowing and allows the cover to fit securely. Containers for garbage and rubbish shall be of an adequate size and of sufficient numbers to contain without overflowing, all the refuse that a household or other establishment generates within the designated removal period (CCR, § 17315). Overflowing refuse is a public health violation. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any building, lot or premises to notify the Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent promptly when necessary to upgrade collection service, to prevent refuse from overflowing existing containers. If the City or authorized Health Officer (LEA) determines that inadequate service causes a public nuisance or health problem, they may order the owner to upgrade service and lien property for any cost of clean up and/or upgraded service. The Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent shall upgrade collection service immediately upon notice.
D. Burning. No solid waste shall be burned within the City without having first obtained a permit to do so from the governmental body or agency responsible for fire protection and having jurisdiction to issue the same. Any such burning pursuant to permit shall be done in accordance with any and all applicable federal, state, county, district or other local laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations, including, but not limited to, requirements of any entity or agency having jurisdiction over air pollution or public health and safety.
E. Transportation of Solid Waste. No person shall move, convey or transport or cause or permit to be moved, conveyed or transported any solid wastes upon or along any public street or alley or other public place in the City; provided, however, the provisions of this section shall not apply to any person conveying solid waste collected outside the City, nor to any person employed by the City who shall be assigned to the work of solid waste removal while acting within the scope of his or her employment or to any person or entity with whom the City has entered into or may hereafter enter into a contract for the collection, removal, or disposal of solid waste or to any employee of such contractor during such time as such contract shall be in force. Nor shall this section be deemed to prohibit an individual from exercising his rights as described in subsections (A) and (H) of this section, and which authorizes occasional disposals at authorized disposal sites.
F. 
    1. Obligation of Disposal. Every property owner, occupant or tenant of any premises within the City shall have the obligation for disposal of solid waste as provided in this chapter through the designated Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent and shall pay said Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent for said collection service at the rates provided therefor. Failure of receipt of a bill does not obviate responsibility for payment. In each instance, the property owner shall be primarily responsible for the payment of the charges provided for herein. The City and/or Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent may cause a lien to be placed upon the real property for failure to compensate the Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent for services rendered.
    2. Payment by City for Continued Service. If all payments are not made when due for six (6) consecutive months or for any six (6) months in a twelve-month period, and after reasonable efforts to collect them have failed, the Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent shall so notify the City in writing, showing the total delinquency and a summary of the efforts made to collect. The City shall thereafter notify the owner of the property of the delinquency by first-class mail, postage prepaid, and by certified mail with return receipt requested. The notice shall demand that all delinquent payments be paid immediately and provide notice that, if not paid, the City will order the Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent to resume regular service, pay the charges therefor, and collect the amount paid from the property owner in the form of a lien in favor of the City upon the real property on which the premises are located. In the event the City is compelled to proceed pursuant to the provisions of this section, a cost charge established by resolution of the City Council will be added for each month or part of a month that collection in this manner is necessary, which charge shall continue until the owner pays all the delinquent charges, plus the costs, and resumes normal garbage collection with payments therefor. The monthly cost charge established by resolution of the City Council shall be retained by the City for the costs of assuring that garbage does not accumulate on the property, to the detriment of the public health, safety, and welfare.
    3. Recovery of City’s Costs of Continuing Service. Any cost or expense incurred by the City to enforce the provisions of this chapter shall be, and the same is hereby ordered, a lien against the real property of the responsible person and shall be assessed, levied, and collected in the same manner as City and county real property taxes.
G. Unauthorized Removal of Recyclable Materials – Ownership of Recyclable Materials. No person, other than the Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent of the City or county, shall remove paper, glass, cardboard, plastic, used motor oil, ferrous metal, aluminum, or other recyclable materials which have been segregated from solid waste materials and placed at a designated collection location for residential curbside collection programs authorized by a city, county, or local agency for the purposes of collection and recycling. From the time the recyclable materials specified above are placed for collection at curbside, for a residential curbside collection program, or a designated collection location, authorized by a city, county, or local agency, the recyclable materials are the property of the Authorized Refuse and Recycling Agent (PRC, § 41950).

As used herein, the annual minimum sewer service charge shall be construed to mean the minimum amount chargeable for said sewer service; however, for any of the classifications listed herein, the annual sewer charge may be more than that adopted by the City Council when it is determined by the City Manager that it is uneconomical for the City to supply sewer services to the user for the minimum sewer service charge. (Ord. 1030 § 2(5), 2018; Ord. 594 § 4, 1978)

6.12.210 Assignment of Sewer User Units.
A. One Unit Minimum. All premises connected to the City sewer system shall be assigned a minimum of one sewer use unit.
B. Dwelling Unit. One sewer user unit shall be assigned to each dwelling unit, including those contained in single-family buildings, multiple-dwelling buildings and each dwelling unit contained in a commercial, industrial, or other improved premises.
C. Nonresidential Premises. For premises other than those provided under subsection (B) of this section, Dwelling Unit, sewer user units shall be assigned as determined by the City Manager, based on the amount and strength of the sewage discharge from the premises. The winter water use for each nonresidential user shall be divided by one thousand (1,000) cubic feet, which is deemed to be the average monthly winter seasonal residential use for the base year, to determine the sewer user units to be assigned. Sewer user units as calculated above shall be rounded to the nearest integer (not less than one).
D. Base Year Water Consumption. Sewer user unit assignments are based on the latest winter season water consumption records available at the time of the first adoption of the ordinance codified in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 6.12.010, 6.12.040, and 6.12.190 through 6.12.260, and may be revised from time to time. Water consumption by nonresidential users shall be adjusted upon request of the user, according to the decision of the City Manager if a significant portion of the base year water consumption was used for irrigation flows and other flows not discharging to the sewer system.
E. High Strength Sewage. For certain nonresidential premises which discharge sewage, having significantly greater strength characteristics as measured by concentration of solids or biological oxygen demand than residential sewage, the total sewer user unit assignment shall be determined by multiplying the units determined in subsection (C) of this section by the strength factor shown as follows:
+-------------------------------+-----------------+
|             User              | Strength Factor |

For other users, if any, discharging high strength sewage, the strength factor shall be based on the Revenue Program Guidelines for Waste Water Agencies prepared by the State Water Resources Control Board, designated as Exhibit A, found at the end of this chapter.
F. Inquiry Regarding Assignment of Sewer User Units and Strength Factors. Inquiries regarding the assignment of sewer user units and strength factors must be submitted to the City in writing before changes in unit assignment will be made. The City Manager shall have the authority to make appropriate adjustments in sewer user units and strength factors assigned based on the Revenue Program Guidelines for Waste Water Agencies prepared by the State Water Resources Control Board.

(Ord. 1030 § 2(5), 2018; Ord. 594 § 9, 1978)

6.12.260 Special Assessment.
The annual charge for sewer user services shall become a special assessment and lien against the real property, which assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to such sewer service user charges, as authorized by Health and Safety Code Part 3, Chapter 6, Article 4, Section 5470 et seq.

9.11.100 Construction Site Best Management Practices.
A. Any person performing construction activities in the City shall implement appropriate BMPs to prevent the discharge of construction wastes or pollutants from construction materials, tools, and equipment from entering the storm drain system or watercourse. Pollutants associated with construction activity include but are not limited to sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, paints, solvents and fuels.
B. The City has the authority to review designs and proposals for construction activities to determine whether adequate BMPs will be installed, implemented, and maintained during construction and after final site stabilization.
C. Construction site BMPs include erosion and sediment controls and pollution prevention practices. Erosion control BMPs may include, but are not limited to, scheduling and timing of grading activities, timely revegetation of graded areas, the use of hydroseed and hydraulic mulches, and installation of erosion control blankets. Sediment control may include properly sized detention basins, dams, or filters to reduce entry of suspended sediment into the storm drain system and watercourses, and installation of construction entrances to prevent tracking of sediment onto adjacent streets. Pollution prevention practices may include designated washout areas or facilities, control of trash and recycled materials, tarping of materials stored on site, and proper location of and maintenance of temporary sanitary facilities. The combination of BMPs used, and their execution in the field, must be customized to the site using up-to-date standards and practices. The City will provide references to current guidance manuals and BMP information on request.
D. Erosion and Sediment Control Plan Requirements. 
    1. When required by the Phase II Stormwater Permit or by the City, a construction project shall have an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (ESCP) that addresses erosion and sediment control and pollution prevention during the construction phase as well as final stabilization control measures. The ESCP shall be implemented year round. An ESCP shall be required for any construction project that:
        a. Requires a grading permit under Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 15.20, Grading, Excavation, and Fills;
        b. Requires a building permit, encroachment permit, demolition permit, or other permit that has the potential for significant erosion and/or significant nonstormwater discharges of sediment and/or construction site waste; or
        c. Is determined necessary, in the City’s reasonable discretion after considering factors such as whether the project involves hillside soil disturbance, rainy season construction, construction near a watercourse, or any other condition or activity that poses a threat to water quality or could lead to a nonstormwater discharge if not managed by effective implementation of an ESCP.
    2. The construction project applicant shall submit the ESCP for review and written approval by the City. The ESCP shall be revised to reflect changing conditions on the project site. The City shall require modifications of an approved ESCP if, during the course of construction at a site, unanticipated conditions occur or the plans prove inadequate for the intended purpose. Revisions of the approved ESCP shall be submitted to the City for review and approval.
    3. In developing the ESCP, the project applicant shall follow the most recent version of the MCSTOPPP Construction Erosion and Sediment Control Plan Applicant Package. At a minimum, the ESCP shall include:
        a. Description of the proposed project and soil disturbing activity;
        b. Site specific construction-phase BMPs;
        c. Rationale for selecting the BMPs including supporting soil loss calculations, if necessary;
        d. List of applicable permits associated with the soil disturbing activity, such as: Construction General Permit (CGP); Clean Water Act Section 404 Permit; Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification; Streambed/Lake Alteration Agreement (1600 Agreements).
    4. If the project requires coverage under the Construction General Permit (CGP) issued by the State Water Resources Control Board, permit registration documents must be filed with the State Water Resources Control Board for said coverage and a copy of the Waste Discharge Identification Number shall be submitted to the City prior to issuance of a permit for construction activity. The applicant may submit the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) required by the CGP in lieu of the ESCP provided it meets the requirements of the ESCP.
    5. Implementation of an approved ESCP shall be a condition of the issuance of a building permit, a grading permit, encroachment permit, demolition permit, or other permit issued by the City for a project subject to this section. In order to obtain a grading permit, the project applicant shall also submit evidence to the City that all permits directly associated with the grading activity have been obtained prior to commencing the soil disturbing activities authorized by the grading permit.
E. Financial security may be required to ensure that temporary measures to control stormwater pollution are implemented and maintained during construction and after construction for a period determined by the City. Financial security shall consist of an irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, or performance bond as determined by the City.
F. The authorized enforcement official has a right to inspect the construction site to verify compliance with this chapter. Inspections shall include, at a minimum, maintenance of BMPs, effectiveness of BMPs installed, and verification that pollutants of concern are not discharged into watercourse. At the conclusion of construction, the authorized enforcement official has a right to inspect the site to ensure that all disturbed areas have been stabilized and that all temporary erosion and sediment control measures that are no longer needed have been removed.
G. If the authorized enforcement official determines, in his or her reasonable discretion, that the construction site does not contain the proper BMPs or is otherwise not compliant with the requirements of this chapter, the authorized enforcement official may order the construction site operator to cease and desist any construction activity until such violations are cured. Such order shall be issued in writing served on the construction site operator or any other person overseeing the construction activity. The authorized enforcement official may also take additional corrective or enforcement actions consistent with the City’s Enforcement Response Plan and the remedies available in the City’s Municipal Code.

    6. Notice that the property owner must either (a) remove the graffiti within seven (7) days of the date of the notice or (b) give the City consent to remove the graffiti by executing the enclosed consent, release and waiver; failure to remove the graffiti or give such consent will cause the City to remove the graffiti at the property owner’s expense; and that graffiti removal and graffiti abatement costs may be assessed as a lien against the property.
B. Service of the Notice to Remove Graffiti. The notice to remove graffiti shall be personally served, or shall be sent by United States Postal Mail, with proof of service. The service is complete at the time of deposit in the mail or when personal service is effectuated.

C. Proof of Service. A declaration of the person effectuating service shall be affixed to a copy of the notice to remove graffiti and retained by the City.
D. Administrative Order – If Property Owner Fails to Remove, City Abates. The property owner must either remove the graffiti within seven (7) days of the date of the notice or contact the City and give the City consent to remove the graffiti. If the property owner does not remove the graffiti or provide authorization to the City to remove the graffiti within seven (7) days of the service of the notice to remove graffiti, then the property owner will be subject to removal by the City, including payment of the City’s costs of graffiti removal in accordance with this chapter.

In making its decision, the City Council may consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the number of times which graffiti was placed on the property of the property owner; (2) whether the property owner took reasonable measures to prevent graffiti from being placed on the property; (3) the cost of removing the graffiti; and/or (4) the cooperation of the property owner with the City toward eradicating the graffiti.

Where a structure is privately owned, the removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material pursuant to this section may be authorized only after securing the consent of the owner and obtaining an executed release and waiver from the property owner approved as to form by the City Attorney.
B. The City Manager is hereby authorized pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.3 to use City funds to remove graffiti through the graffiti removal program. In removing the graffiti or other inscribed material pursuant to the graffiti removal program, the use of City funds to paint or repair is limited to the area inscribed with the graffiti.
C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the City shall be authorized to recover its costs of graffiti removal from private property pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.20.090.
D. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the City Manager or his or her designee from waiving the provisions of this section if it can be determined that the affected property owner has demonstrated a conscientious effort to prevent graffiti from occurring on his or her property.

The failure of any person to receive a Notice of Violation that was sent via registered or certified mail shall not affect the validity of any enforcement proceedings under this chapter.
C. The Enforcement Officer shall retain a declaration of the person effecting service, declaring the date, time, and manner that service was made, and the date and place of posting if applicable.
D. The time allowed for abatement of a nuisance shall be a “reasonable time” in the judgment of the Enforcement Officer, based upon the circumstances of the particular nuisance, taking into consideration the means required to abate the nuisance, the period of time that the nuisance has existed, and the potential threat to public health and safety created by the nuisance.
E. The Enforcement Officer may issue a verbal notice, or an informal written notice, to abate the nuisance condition(s). However, if, following a verbal or informal written notice to abate, the nuisance has not been abated within the specified time period, the Enforcement Officer shall issue a formal written Notice of Violation.

9.24.120 Hearing Request and Procedure.
A. Any recipient of a Notice of Violation may request an appeals hearing to contest that there was a violation, as specified in the Notice of Violation, or that he or she is the responsible party for said violation, by completing a “Request for Hearing Form” and returning it to the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days from the date of the Notice of Violation. At the time of returning the Request for Hearing Form to the City Clerk, the person or entity requesting the appeals hearing shall pay an appeals processing fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).

B. If the recipient of a Notice of Violation does not submit a proper request for an appeals hearing, and does not comply with the Notice of Violation by the specified date, the Enforcement Officer shall have the right to issue an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) in the manner and form described herein, requiring a hearing before the City Council, or other designated body. Any hearing requested under this section, whether an appeals hearing or an OSC hearing, shall be conducted under the procedures set forth below.
C. Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section, whether an appeals hearing requested by a recipient of a Notice of Violation, or pursuant to an OSC, shall be set for a date not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date that the Request for Hearing Form or OSC is filed in accordance with this chapter, unless the Enforcement Officer determines that the matter is urgent or that good cause exists for an extension of time, in which case the date for such hearing may be shortened, or extended, as warranted by the circumstances.
D. If the Enforcement Officer issues an OSC, a copy of the OSC shall be served on the violator in the manner described in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.24.110(B). Where real property is involved, a copy of the OSC, along with a copy of the original Notice of Violation, shall be served on the property owner at the address as it appears on the last county assessment roll available on the date the OSC is prepared. The OSC must contain the date, time, and place at which the hearing will be conducted.
E. Any hearing provided in this section shall provide a full opportunity for the person or persons subject to a Notice of Violation to appear and object to the determination that a violation has occurred and/or that the violation continues to exist. The failure of any interested party to appear at a requested appeals hearing or a duly noticed OSC hearing shall constitute a failure by such party to exhaust his/her/their administrative remedies, and a waiver of the same.
F. At the place and time set forth in the notice of hearing, the City Council, or other designated person(s), shall conduct a hearing on the Notice of Violation. The person(s) hearing the appeal (“the hearing body”) shall consider any written or oral evidence regarding the violation that may be presented by the violator, real property owner, any officer or agent of the City, and any other interested party.

H. Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing body shall issue written findings and make a determination regarding the existence of the violation and/or the failure of the violator or owner to take required corrective action within the specified time period. If the hearing body finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation occurred, or that a violation was not corrected within the time period specified in the Notice of Violation, the hearing body shall issue an administrative order, in accordance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.24.130. If the hearing body finds that no violation occurred or that the violation was corrected within the specified time period, the hearing body shall issue a written finding of those facts.
I. The recipient or recipients of a Notice of Violation shall be served with a copy of the decision of the hearing body, including an administrative order if one is issued, in the manner and method set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.24.110(B). (Ord. 1036 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(7), 2018; Ord. 914 § 2, 2002)

9.24.130 Administrative Order.

Such costs, if unpaid, may be recovered by the City through a lien on the property pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.1 or through a special assessment pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5.
B. Any person aggrieved by an administrative order of the hearing body may obtain review of said administrative order in the Marin County Superior Court by filing with the court a petition for writ of mandate, subject to the conditions described in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.24.180.

The bail schedule described in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.24.080(D) shall not limit or affect the amount of actual fines or penalties imposed, including any fines and penalties authorized by Government Code Section 36901, nor shall said bail schedule limit or preclude the recovery of any costs incurred by the City in enforcing the provisions of this code or abating any nuisance condition, where the same may be lawfully imposed.
A. Any administrative fine or penalty imposed by the hearing body after a hearing shall be paid to the City within thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice of Violation, unless an extension of time is requested by the offender and granted by the Enforcement Officer or City Council.
B. Any appeal processing fee that is paid pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.24.120(A) shall be refunded to the payee if it is determined, after a hearing, that the person charged in the Notice of Violation was not responsible for the violation or that there was no violation as charged in said notice.
C. Payment of a fine or penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not excuse or permit any continuation or repeated occurrence of the violation that is the subject of the Notice of Violation.
D. In determining the amount of an administrative fine or penalty to be levied against a violator, the hearing body may take the following factors into consideration:
    1. The duration of the violation;
    2. The frequency, re-occurrence, and number of violations by the same violator;
    3. The seriousness of the violation;
    4. The justification, if any, for the existence, or continuance, of the violation;
    5. The good faith efforts of the violator to mitigate the violation or to come into compliance, pursuant to the terms of the Notice of Violation;
    6. The impact of the violation on the community;
    7. The economic impact of the proposed penalty or fine on the violator;
    8. The factors listed in the Uniform Administrative Code Section 304.5.2; and
    9. Such other factors as justice may require.
E. Any administrative fine or penalty imposed by the hearing body shall accrue from the date specified in the Notice of Violation and shall continue to accrue on a daily basis until the violation is corrected. The determination of compliance or elimination of the violation shall be determined by the Enforcement Officer, or the hearing body at the time of an appeals hearing. The hearing body, in its discretion, may suspend the imposition of any applicable fines or penalties for a period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days during which:
    1. The violator has filed for, or obtained, necessary permits;
    2. Such permits are required to achieve compliance; and
    3. Such permit applications are actively pending before, or have already been issued by, the City, state, or other appropriate governmental agency.
F. Any administrative penalty or fines assessed by the Enforcement Officer, or the hearing body following an appeals hearing, are a debt owed to the City. In addition to all other means of enforcement, any fines, penalties, or order allowing recovery of administrative costs specified in the administrative order of the hearing body may be enforced as a personal obligation of the violator. If the violation is in connection with real property, any fines, penalties, or order allowing recovery of administrative costs may be enforced by imposition of a lien or special assessment upon the real property. Any lien or special assessment imposed upon the real property shall remain in effect until all of the administrative penalties, fines, interest, and administrative costs are paid in full. (Ord. 1036 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(7), 2018; Ord. 914 § 2, 2002)

9.24.150 Summary Abatement Procedure.
Whenever, in the reasonable judgment of the Enforcement Officer, the existence or continuance of any public nuisance poses an imminent or immediate danger of significant harm to persons or property, or endangers the public health, welfare or safety, an Enforcement Officer may act to abate such nuisance. The expense or cost resulting from such summary abatement shall be enforceable as a personal obligation of the person, persons, or entity responsible for the nuisance, including the property owner of any property on which such public nuisance exists, whether or not the owner is in possession of the property. The expense or cost of summary abatement may be imposed as a lien or a special assessment, as described in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 9.24.160. (Ord. 1036 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(7), 2018; Ord. 914 § 2, 2002)

9.24.160 Cost Accounts and Imposition of Liens or Special Assessments.
A. If a judicial order or administrative order authorizes the City to abate a public nuisance, the City official(s) responsible for the abatement project shall keep an accounting of the cost of abatement and shall render a written report to the City Council showing the cost of removing and/or abating the nuisance. Before the report is submitted to the City Council, a copy shall be posted for at least three (3) business days on the City Hall bulletin board with a notice of the time and place when the report will be submitted to the City Council for confirmation. A copy of the report and notice shall be mailed to the violator, or the owner of the property where the nuisance existed if the nuisance concerned real property at the address shown on the last tax roll. The copy of the report and notice shall be mailed at least ten (10) days  prior to the submission of the report to the City Council.
B. At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the report, the City Council shall hear a summary of the report and any objections by the violator or property owner against whom the cost of abatement is being charged or against whose property an abatement lien or special assessment may be imposed for the cost of abatement. After considering the report and any objections thereto, the City Council may make such modifications to the report as it deems appropriate, after which the report shall be confirmed by resolution or order.
C. Any fines or penalties imposed for violations of this code, including any other codes or statutes that have been incorporated into this code, any expenses of enforcement, and the cost or expenses associated with the abatement of a public nuisance that are levied in accordance with this chapter may be enforced by the recordation of a lien against the property of the violator or the owner of the real property where the nuisance condition existed. Any such lien shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s office in the county in which the parcel of land is located and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien. A lien authorized by this section shall specify the amount of the lien, the name of the City on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the date of the abatement order, the street address, legal description and assessor’s parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel. Before recordation of a lien authorized by this section, notice shall be served on the owner of record of the parcel of land on which the nuisance existed, based on the last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current. The notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. If the owner of record cannot be found, after a diligent search, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days  and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in Marin County, California. Any fee imposed on the City by the County Recorder for costs of processing and recording the lien and the cost of providing notice to the property owner in the manner described herein may be recovered from the property owner in any foreclosure action to enforce the lien after recordation.
D. As an alternative to the lien procedure described above, any fines or penalties imposed for violations of this code, including any other codes or statutes that have been incorporated into this code, any expenses of enforcement, and the cost or expenses associated with the abatement of a public nuisance that are levied in accordance with this chapter, may become a special assessment and lien against the real property where the nuisance condition existed. Any special assessment imposed on real property pursuant to this section may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as is provided for ordinary municipal taxes. Notice of any special assessment that is levied on real property, pursuant to this section, shall be given to the property owner by certified mail, and shall contain the information set forth in Government Code Section 38773.5(c). All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of municipal taxes, including those described in Government Code Section 38773.5(c), shall be applicable to such special assessment. (Ord. 1036 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(7), 2018; Ord. 914 § 2, 2002)

9.24.170 Supplementary Enforcement Authority.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the City from initiating a criminal, civil or administrative enforcement action, or any other legal or equitable proceeding, to obtain compliance or to discourage noncompliance with the provisions of this code. The enforcement procedures described in this chapter are intended to be alternative methods of obtaining compliance and/or discouraging noncompliance with the provisions of this code and are expressly intended to be in addition to any other remedies provided by law. It is the intent of the City Council that the immunities prescribed in Penal Code Section 836.5 shall be applicable to public officers or employees acting in the course and scope of employment pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 1036 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(7), 2018; Ord. 914 § 2, 2002)

9.24.180 Limitation of Time for Judicial Review of Quasi-Judicial Decisions.
A. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 or successor statute are hereby adopted and any petition for review of an administrative decision of the City of Larkspur, or of any of its boards, commissions, departments, agencies, or persons authorized to render such a decision, shall be filed within the time limits prescribed therein. Notwithstanding such time limits, where a shorter time limitation is provided by any other law, such shorter time limit shall apply.
B. The limitation provided in subsection (A) of this section shall apply to any final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the person(s) conducting the hearing.
C. The limitation provided in subsection (A) of this section shall apply to all quasi-judicial proceedings now pending or hereafter begun. Written notice of said limitation of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 shall be given to the parties by the decision-maker in substantially the following form:The time within which judicial review of this decision must be sought is governed by Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. Judicial review must be sought not later than the 90th day following the date on which this decision becomes final, except that where a shorter time is provided by any state or federal law, such shorter time limit shall apply.
D. The limitation provided in subsection (A) of this section shall be construed to require that petitions filed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 for review of administrative decisions rendered prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter must be filed within ninety (90) days from the date upon which notice of the time limits provided in this section is mailed or personally delivered to all parties to such administrative decision, unless a shorter time limit applies. Notice under this subsection shall be in substantially the following form:By ordinance, the time limits set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 have been made applicable to the decision rendered by (decision maker) on (date) concerning (title or description of administrative action). Judicial review must be sought not later than the 90th day following the date of this notice, except that where a shorter time limit is prescribed by any other law, such shorter time limit shall apply.
E. This section shall not be deemed to revive any cause of action or grounds for relief through a special proceeding which is barred by law or equity.
F. All costs of preparing a record which may be recovered by a local agency pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6(c) or successor statute shall be paid by the petitioner prior to delivery of the record to petitioner. (Ord. 1036 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(7), 2018; Ord. 914 § 2, 2002)

A. Permit Required. It is unlawful for any person to remove, or cause to be removed, any heritage tree from any parcel of property without obtaining a permit as defined herein.
B. When a tree poses an immediate hazard or is dangerous to life or property, it may be authorized to be removed without a permit by order of the City Manager or other responsible City official.
C. Permit. Any person desiring to remove one or more heritage trees or prune beyond the “best practices” pruning guidelines promulgated by the International Society of Arboriculture or the American National Standards Institute shall apply to the City Manager or his/her designee or Planning Department, as appropriate, for a permit.
D. Application and Fee. The application for a permit shall be made on forms provided and shall state the reason for removal of each tree and other information as may be required. A plan shall be submitted showing the perimeter outline of adjacent buildings or proposed buildings and the type, number and location of the tree(s) to be removed. The fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
E. Report by Qualified Arborist. A report and recommendation from a qualified arborist shall be provided unless exempted by the City Manager.
The applicant shall bear all expenses in conjunction with said report. A City Arborist will monitor permitted removals and trimmings when necessary to ensure protection of the subject heritage tree(s) or adjacent tree(s). If required by the City, the applicant shall bear the cost for the City Arborist to monitor all permitted removals and trimmings.
F. Findings. After reviewing the appropriate application, the City Manager, Planning Commission or Park and Recreation Commission shall:
    1. Make both of the following findings before approving the permit:
        a. The removal of the tree will not adversely affect the topography of the land or cause significant erosion or increase flow of surface water; and
        b. Removal of the tree, after consideration was given to the number of existing trees in the neighborhood, will not adversely affect the general health, safety and welfare or be detrimental to persons or property in the vicinity.
    2. In addition to the two above findings, one of the following findings shall be made before approving the permit:
        a. The condition of the tree poses a hazard with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and/or interference with utility services; or
        b. Removal of the tree is necessary to prevent unreasonable interference with the property owner’s investment-backed expectations. In making that determination, the decision-maker shall consider the following factors: (i) the history of the property, including date of purchase and nature of title; (ii) history of development of the property, including what was built on the property, by whom, and when; (iii) the history of heritage tree regulation in the City, including but not limited to the date of first enactment of the regulations relative to the owner’s acquisition of the property; (iv) the present nature of development and use of the property; (v) the reasonable expectations of the property owner for use of the property; (vi) the reasonable expectations of neighbors in regards to preservation of heritage trees on the property; and (vii) the effect of denial on the property owner’s reasonable expectations, if any.
G. Planning Commission Permit. Any person desiring to remove one or more heritage trees due to proposed construction shall apply for a permit from the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may require replacement trees in a reasonable number depending on the type and size of the tree(s) removed and the recommendations of a qualified arborist.
H. Permits issued under this section shall be valid for twelve (12) months. One permit extension of six (6) months may be authorized by the City Manager.
I. Notification. If the City Manager determines that a permit should be approved and has made the necessary findings outlined herein, notices shall be sent to all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property using names and addresses appearing on the latest adopted Assessor’s roll of the county, indicating that a permit will be issued for the removal of the heritage tree unless a written protest is received by the City within fifteen (15) days of the date of the notice. The City Manager shall also post a notice on the subject heritage tree or by using some other marking to readily identify the affected tree to interested parties and to maximize the visibility of the notice.
J. Public Hearing Before the Park and Recreation Commission. In the event that a written protest is submitted to the City within the time limits prescribed in subsection (I) of this section, or if a property owner wishes to appeal the City Manager’s decision to deny a permit, a public hearing shall be set before the Park and Recreation Commission and the following procedures shall be followed:
    1. A notice of the public hearing is to be given by mail at least ten (10) days  prior to the date of the hearing to all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property using names and addresses appearing on the latest adopted Assessor’s roll of the county.
    2. The notice shall indicate that written public comments are to be submitted concerning the proposal prior to the public hearing, if possible.
    3. A notice of the hearing shall be posted on the subject heritage tree or by using some other marking to readily identify the affected tree to interested parties.
    4. The Park and Recreation Commission shall review the application and shall make the same findings as required of the City Manager as established in subsection (F) of this section. Any decision rendered by the Park and Recreation Commission may be appealed within fifteen (15) days.
    5. The Park and Recreation Commission may establish conditions of approval for the permit based on the same standards outlined in subsection (F) of this section.
K. Process for Removal of Pyrophytic Trees. An application shall be made on the forms provided. The permit fee shall be waived for the removal of pyrophytic trees. Upon investigation and verification by the Fire Department that the pyrophytic trees are deemed to be a fire hazard, the permit shall be granted by the City Manager and no further procedures under this chapter are applicable. “Pyrophytic trees” are defined as Monterey Pine, Knob Cone Pine, Blue Gum Eucalyptus, Red Gum Eucalyptus, Juniper, and certain Acacia, defined as: Baily Acacia, Purple-Leaf Acacia, or any Acacia species over fifty (50) feet in height.
L. No tree with pyrophytic properties as defined in this code shall be planted in a high fire hazard zone area as specified in this code.
M. Process for the Removal of Diseased Oak Trees. Upon receipt of a permit application for the removal of a diseased oak tree, staff will confirm that a report from a qualified arborist is attached, which substantiates that the tree is affected with the disease termed Sudden Oak Death Syndrome. Staff will conduct a site inspection to verify the findings of the report and confirm that the tree is dead or significantly affected. If the findings are confirmed, staff will issue the permit for the removal by a qualified tree contractor. No public notification or hearing is required.

14.04.120 Findings.
To the extent that any of the provisions of this chapter constitute changes or modifications in the requirements contained in Health and Safety Code Section 17922, the City Council does hereby find that such changes and modifications are reasonably necessary because of local conditions prevailing within the City of Larkspur. A description of said local conditions is hereinafter set forth.CLIMATIC. The weather patterns within the City of Larkspur are considered to be moderately affected by the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay, which extends the year-round growing season of vegetation. The normal year’s rainfall is approximately 28 inches, while the summer condition, with its prevalent Pacific high cell, creates the morning and late afternoon fog normally associated with the San Francisco Bay.
While normal temperatures usually do not exceed 75-80 degrees during the summer months, little or no rain falls during the period between April and November. This combination often creates hazardous fuel conditions in the City. Drying winds in the summer and fall months reduce fuel moisture and relative humidity to the minimum levels, thereby creating ideal fire weather conditions. The normal afternoon winds that precede the fog can move a fire quickly in the hillside and open space areas of the city.
Because of climatic conditions, the County of Marin has experienced water rationing in recent years, including a mandatory 35 percent reduction in 1989. Water shortages can be expected in future years due to limited storage capacities in Marin, increased domestic consumption and weather patterns that reduce the already minimal annual rainfall. While sound management of the water resources is possible, actual demands on an already stressed water supply can most assuredly be predicted.
GEOLOGIC. The City of Larkspur is geologically mixed with three classifications of rock: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The outstanding material is volcanic in origin with ridges of serpentine reaching in excess of 700 feet in elevation.
Much of the City is characterized by precipitous hilly areas where escape opportunities from residential structures are limited to one side of the home only. The steepness and uneven nature of the land often hinders, and sometimes prevents, the erecting of rescue ladders at the side of a home on a hillside parcel.
Seismic activity within the City occurs yearly with little or no damage, although a real potential does exist with the City situated between two active faults: The San Andreas and Hayward faults.
Landslides have also been experienced in the City in recent years. While stabilization of hillsides can sometimes be achieved, heavy rainfalls have caused failures. These slides can close roadways, making accessibility to many locations in the City impossible until properly cleared.
TOPOGRAPHIC. The City is accessible from the outside by one primary thoroughfare on the east side and three on the west side. Speed limits of 25 miles per hour, by virtue of the narrow and twisting configuration of the roads, do not allow quick responses to emergencies. The Highway 101 corridor goes directly through the City and an overpass that may or may not withstand an earthquake presents another problem.
Vehicular access within the City is affected by steep, hilly terrain and many secondary ridgelines. Many streets are narrow and winding, restricting the speed at which fire apparatus may safely respond and also increasing the time lapse between fire detection and apparatus arrival, during which time a family will face the fire or other emergency on their own. The City has many dead-end streets, and in Madrone Canyon, there is one main access route in or out of the area. Dead-end streets can restrict the ease of relocating fire and rescue equipment from one location to another, even though actual separating distance between two areas may be minimal. In addition to restricting access routes for fire apparatus, the dead-end streets also limit egress opportunities for residents.
Many of the commercial buildings in Larkspur were largely built long before present code requirements existed. Consequently, many of these structures do not meet even minimal standards for fire protection and life safety. Wood frame construction of older buildings, especially those in mountainous areas, creates an adverse exposure problem, not only in being easily ignited by an adjacent structure fire, but also in contributing to the extension of fire to other buildings through radiation, actual physical heat conduction and flying embers. Fire history in the City has shown flying embers will start secondary fires after blowing in the air.
Throughout the City, there are areas in which there are no water mains constructed at all. Meadow Valley has no water main supply, other than domestic, and there is minimal water supply along Casa Buena Drive, fronting the auto dealerships and the other major commercial establishments.
The buildings on Christmas Tree Hill, many of which were constructed 50 or more years ago, are serviced by minimal water main sizes. The lack of adequate water supply in this area, along with winding streets, creates a unique fire problem. The generalized water shortage in Marin County results in occasional inadequate water volume and pressure for firefighting purposes in certain areas of the City.

A. Chapter 1, Section 105.5, Building Permit Expiration, is amended to read as follows:1. Except in those construction projects where the Building Official, due to the nature of the project, deems these limitations to be unreasonable, every permit issued by the Building Official, under the provisions of this chapter, shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days following the issuance date of such permit.
2. Following expiration of a permit under subsection A.1., and before work can commence, the original permit may be extended for one 180 day period provided:
(a) No changes have been made or will be made, in the original plans and specifications for such work; and
(b) That such delay has not exceeded one year from the date of original issuance of the permit.
3. Following the expiration of a permit under subsection A.1., and where the criteria provided under Section 2 is not met, the Building Official has the discretion to determine if the permit may be reactivated and apply new requirements and conditions as necessary, including payment of a reactivation fee equal to the original permit fee. The original permit fee is considered the cumulative amounts assessed on the building permit for building, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, energy conservation, grading, green building and accessibility compliance.
4. Building Permit Construction Time Limits.
a. The maximum time for completion of approved alterations, additions, modifications, repairs, or new construction, following issuance of the building permit, and commencement of any demolition or construction work, shall not exceed the following:

15.18.010 Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods.
A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Larkspur does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
B. Findings of Fact. 
    1. The flood hazard areas of the City of Larkspur are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
    2. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to the flood loss.
C. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
    1. Protect human life and health;
    2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
    3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
    4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
    5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
    6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;
    7. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
    8. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.
D. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:
    1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
    2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
    3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
    4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
    5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 845 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.18.020 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
“Accessory structure” means a structure that is either:
    1. Solely for the parking of no more than two (2) cars; or
    2. A small, low-cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet and one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) in value.
“Accessory use” means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.
“Alluvial fan” means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone- or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.
“Apex” means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front.
“Appeal” means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
“Base flood” means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “one-hundred-year flood”). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter.
“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade – i.e., below ground level – on all sides.
“Breakaway walls” means any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which are not part of the structural support of the building and which are designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood waters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:
    1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and
    2. The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.
“Building.” See “Structure.”
“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as Zone V1-V30, VE, or V.
“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
“Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
“Flood,” “flooding,” or “floodwater” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
“Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.
“Flood hazard boundary map” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.
“Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
“Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
“Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See “Flooding.”
“Floodplain Administrator” means the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.
“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other applications of police power which control development in floodprone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-08, TB 3-93 and TB 7-93.
“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”
“Floodway encroachment lines” means the lines marking the limits of floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps.
“Floodway fringe” means that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
“Fraud and victimization,” as related to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.060, Variance Procedures, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
“Governing body” means the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
“Hardship,” as related to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.060, Variance Procedures, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
“Historic structure” means any structure that is:
    1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;
    2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;
    3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
    4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs.
“Levee” means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
“Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see “Basement” definition).
    1. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:
        a. The flood openings standard in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(3)(c);
        b. The anchoring standards in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(1);
        c. The construction materials and methods standards in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(2); and
        d. The standards for utilities in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(2)(c).
    2. For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see “Basement” definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.
“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”
“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
“New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community.
“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
“One-hundred-year flood” or “100-year flood.” See “Base flood.”
“Primary frontal dune” means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope.
“Principal structure” means a structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use.
“Public safety and nuisance,” as related to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.060, Variance Procedures, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
    1. Built on a single chassis;
    2. Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

    4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
“Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
“Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
“Sand dunes” means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.
“Sheet flow area.” See “Area of shallow flooding.”
“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area having special flood or mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, A1-A30, AE, A99, V1-V30, VE or V.
“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The “actual” start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
“Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
    1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
    2. Any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.
V Zone. See “Coastal high hazard area.”
“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. (Ord. 976 § 10, 2011; Ord. 845 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.18.030 General Provisions.
A. Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Larkspur.
B. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Larkspur, California, dated September 15, 1988, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated March 15, 1984, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at Larkspur City Hall.
C. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
D. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
E. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
    1. Considered as minimum requirements;
    2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
    3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Council, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, the Federal Insurance Administration, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
G. Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 976 § 10, 2011; Ord. 845 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.18.040 Administration.
A. Establishment of Development Permit. A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.030(B). Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required.
    1. Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; or
    2. Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure will be floodproofed, if required in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(3); and
    3. All appropriate certifications listed in subsection (C)(4) of this section; and
    4. Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
B. Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Building Official is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.
C. Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include but not be limited to the following:
    1. Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that:
        a. Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
        b. All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
        c. The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and
        d. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, “adversely affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
    2. Review and Use of Any Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.030(B), the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption.
    3. Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
        a. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
        b. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
        c. Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
    4. Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:
        a. Certification required by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(3)(a) (floor elevations);
        b. Certification required by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(3)(b) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);
        c. Certification required by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(A)(3)(c) (wet floodproofing standard);
        d. Certification of elevation required by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(C)(2) (subdivision standards);
        e. Certification required by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(F)(1) (floodway encroachments); and
        f. Information required by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050(G)(6) (coastal construction standards).
    5. Map Determinations. Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard; for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.060.
    6. Letters of Map Revision. All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.
    7. Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations. Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a LOMR. All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on CLOMRs. Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.
        a. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.
        b. Changes in Corporate (City) Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the City clearly delineating the new corporate limits.
    8. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.” Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by City staff.
    9. Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.030(B), the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.050. Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two (2) methods from the FEMA publication FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations,” dated July 1995.
    10. Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.030(C).
D. Appeals. The City Council of the City of Larkspur shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. (Ord. 976 § 10, 2011; Ord. 845 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.18.050 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction.
A. Standards of Construction. In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
    1. Anchoring. 
        a. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
        b. All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of subsection (D) of this section.
    2. Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed:
        a. With materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
        b. Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
        c. With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
    3. Elevation and Floodproofing. (See Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.020 definitions for “New construction,” “Substantial damage” and “Substantial improvement.”)
        a. Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement:
            i. In an A zone, elevated to or above the base flood elevation, as determined by the City.
            ii. In all other zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. The City requires that the lowest floor be elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation.
        Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the City Building Inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
        b. Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated to conform with subsection (A)(3)(a) of this section or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
            i. Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under subsection (A)(3)(a) of this section so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
            ii. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
            iii. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection (A)(3)(b) are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
        c. All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must exceed the following minimum criteria:
            i. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or
            ii. Be certified to comply with a local floodproofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency; or
            iii. Have a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
        d. Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in subsection (D) of this section.
B. Standards for Utilities. 
    1. All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
        a. Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
        b. Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
    2. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
C. Standards for Subdivisions and Other Proposed Development.

        a. Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood elevations (BFE).
        b. Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures and pads on the final plans.
        c. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the Floodplain Administrator:
            i. Lowest floor elevation.
            ii. Pad elevation.
            iii. Lowest adjacent grade.
    7. All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
    8. All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
    9. All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
D. Standards for Manufactured Homes. 
    1. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites located: (a) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (b) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, shall: within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the City’s flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
    2. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection (D) will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the:
        a. Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or
        b. Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade.
    3. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the City Building Inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
E. Standards for Recreational Vehicles. 
    1. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map will either:
        a. Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
        b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use – a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or

    2. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map will meet the requirements of subsections (E)(1) and (G) of this section.
F. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.030(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
    1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
    2. If subsection (F)(1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
G. Coastal High Hazard Areas. Within coastal high hazard areas as established under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.030(B), the following standards shall apply.
    1. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the lowest horizontal portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto are anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards.
    2. All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide.
    3. All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.020. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.
    4. Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings.
    5. Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.
    6. The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:
        a. Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection (G)(1) of this section.
        b. The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. (Ord. 976 § 10, 2011; Ord. 845 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.18.060 Variance Procedure.
A. Nature of Variances. The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can properly be granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
B. Appeal Board. 
    1. In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
        a. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
        b. Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
        c. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
        d. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
        e. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
        f. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
        g. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
        h. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
        i. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
        j. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
        k. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
    2. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
        a. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
        b. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Marin County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
    3. The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency.
C. Conditions for Variances. 
    1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.040 and 15.18.050 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
    2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.020) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
    3. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
    4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
    5. Variances shall only be issued upon a:
        a. Showing of good and sufficient cause;
        b. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship (as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.020) to the applicant; and
        c. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.020 – see “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.18.020) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
    6. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections (B)(1) through (C)(5) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and do not result in additional threats to public safety and do not create a public nuisance.
    7. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (B)(1) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 845 § 1 (part), 1993)

A. Minimum Elevation. The minimum elevation after ultimate settlement shall be as follows:
    1. 70 – Streets, lot pads, driveways, parking areas and other specified areas.
    2. 80 – Finished floor of structures.
These minimum elevations apply to areas immediately adjacent to tidal influence which are unaffected by stormwater run-off. Where stormwater run-off, wind action and wave action are a factor, the above minimum elevations shall be increased and a reasonable freeboard provided.
B. Ultimate Settlement. Ultimate settlement means that settlement which is predicted to occur over a thirty-year period, commencing with the completion of all fill operations.
C. Normal Drainage. The street grades and storm drainage system shall be designed for the maximum design storm flowing against a one-hundred-year tide elevation of 63 NGVD. The system must be designed so that gravity drainage will be adequate after ultimate settlement has occurred.
    1. Major waterways having a drainage area of four (4) square miles, or more, shall be designed for an average recurrence interval of one hundred (100) years.
    2. All other waterways less than four (4) square miles shall be designed for an average recurrence interval of twenty-five (25) years.
D. Special Drainage. In those cases where the tributary drainage system entering the area to be filled cannot be made to comply with subsection (C) of this section, then one of the following alternates shall be provided:
    1. Within each such project a holding pond or interconnecting ponds shall be provided. The combined areas of such ponds shall be not less than one-twentieth of the total area drained, including any outside tributary area. The bottom elevation of the ponds shall be not higher than minus three (3) feet.
    2. The culverts draining such holding ponds shall be at least twelve (12) inches in diameter, be equipped with tide gates at the discharge ends and shall have a minimum combined cross-sectional area in square feet equal to eight-one-hundredths times the total number of acres drained, including outside tributary area.
    3. In lieu of the holding ponds, pumps may be provided to handle surface water runoff during the time the discharge end of drain lines is below water. The pumps shall meet the following requirements:
        a. Capacity shall be adequate to handle maximum runoff for the fifty-year storm from area, including any tributary areas.
        b. Discharge from pump shall be to a tidal channel and, if below water, shall be provided with necessary check valves.
        c. Pumps shall operate automatically when the gravity drain lines stop functioning. (Ord. 696 § 1 (part), 1983; Ord. 288 § 6G, 1962)

15.20.360 Variances and Alternates.
At the time of the initial filing of an application or at any time during progress of the work, either the applicant or the City Engineer or the Director of Public Works may propose variances from or alternate to any of the requirements and standards above set forth or stated in any previous permit. Such variances and alternates shall then be reviewed by the officer by whom review is directed under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 15.20.110 through 15.20.140 and the variance or alternate may be authorized if he or it shall find that the general public and adjacent property owners will be equally protected thereby. However, no person shall be entitled to any such variance or alternate as a matter of right, and approval thereof shall be strictly discretionary with the reviewing authority. In the absence of approval of such variance or alternate, the requirements and standards set forth in this chapter shall be strictly adhered to. (Ord. 696 § 1 (part), 1983; Ord. 288 § 6H, 1962)

15.20.370 Findings.
The determination and finding of the officer denying or granting any permit (either with or without conditions), or approving or disapproving any requested variance or alternate, shall be final and conclusive as to all facts, conditions and science involved in and pertinent to such action, unless an appeal is taken as hereinafter provided. A failure to take such appeal or an acceptance of a conditional permit, will constitute approval by the applicant or permittee of all such determinations and findings. (Ord. 696 § 1 (part), 1983; Ord. 288 § 61, 1962)

15.20.380 Nonliability of City.
The City shall not be responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of the inspection or reinspection authorized herein or failure to inspect or reinspect, nor by reason of the terms or conditions of the permit issued nor by reason of the approval or disapproval of any construction.

The Director of Public Works is hereby authorized, after having made a personal inspection thereof, to release such bond and to discharge the persons obligated thereon. The Director of Public Works shall not so release or discharge unless and until he/she is satisfied that there has been no violation of this chapter in connection with the operations referred to in the bond. The finding and determination of the Director of Public Works upon such matters, and his/her action in giving any release or discharge, shall be final and conclusive on all parties; provided, however, that any person dissatisfied with the determination of the Director of Public Works upon such matters may at any time within sixty (60) days thereafter appeal such determination to the City Council of the City of Larkspur, and in such case shall be entitled to a public hearing thereon, together with and including the right to present evidence and have a determination of fact made by said City Council. In any such case the City Council may affirm or reverse the action of the Director of Public Works and may adhere to his decision and require enforcement of the bond, or discharge the bond and the persons obligated thereon, as the evidence and facts may justify. (Ord. 696 § 2 (part), 1983; Ord. 215 § 5 (b), 1952)

15.24.070 Portion of Bond Used by City.
If and whenever the City of Larkspur has recourse to any such bond, the sum to be forfeited to the City shall not be deemed a penalty, nor shall any portion of the principal amount of the bond or of the payment to the City, be retained beyond the actual cost and expense of performing or correcting the default or violation, cleaning the streets or public places and repairing the damage or injury done thereby. Any surplus remaining on hand after accomplishing these things shall be returned to the person or persons who shall have made the deposit or forfeiture. The City Council shall in any such case find and determine the amount of such cost and expense, and shall direct such refund to be made.

This chapter is intended to provide a procedure for studying and/or preserving valuable archaeological resources in the City. Existing in Larkspur are certain deposits of shells, bones and other objects of historical significance believed to have been left by Indians and other early inhabitants. When studied under the supervision of qualified archaeologists, these resources may be of inestimable value in formulating the early history of Larkspur inhabitants. Uncontrolled excavation or modification of these resources, without regard to their possible historical and archaeological values, would destroy the archaeologic integrity of the area. This loss would affect future generations and must be prevented in the public interest. (Ord. 571 § 1 (part), 1977)

(Ord. 571 § 1 (part), 1977)

15.42.040 Permit Procedure.
A. Application for an archaeological investigation permit shall be made by the owner of the resource or a representative of such owner and shall be made in a form acceptable to the planning director. The application shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount determined by city council resolution.
B. Upon receipt of such an application, the planning director or his designee, shall select one of the qualified archaeological advisory agencies (AAA) to inspect the site and prepare an archaeological report thereon and submit such report to the City within fifteen (15) days. The report shall describe the resource, state its significance, recommend the level of data recovery, if any, recommend measures, if any, for protection of the resource and recommend sources of funding for data recovery. The findings of a certified environmental impact report may be accepted by the planning commission in lieu of the archaeological report.
C. The planning commission shall hold a hearing upon the report within seven (7) days of submission. Whenever the planning commission determines that the resource is of archaeological significance, it shall approve the permit only after finding that mitigation measures will be taken to allow maximum protection of the resource and/or maximum preservation of knowledge of the resource. Mitigation measures may be required as conditions of approval, and the City may work with the permittee to find independent funding for the mitigation measures. Conditions of approval may include, but shall not be limited to, any or all of the following conditions:
    1. Preliminary site planning done under the supervision of a qualified archaeologist to relocate construction away from the resource;
    2. Prior to any construction activity, archaeological excavation, identification, classification and proper scientific analysis of artifacts and other materials having historical or archaeological significance shall be accomplished by a person with qualifications satisfactory to the planning commission;
    3. A qualified archaeologist shall be permitted to make periodic visits to the archaeological resource to observe the work-in-progress. (Ord. 571 § 1 (part), 1977)

17.12.040 Easement along Bank.
A. The Planning Commission and City Council shall not approve the tentative or final map of any subdivision fronting on a public waterway, river or stream which does not provide for a dedication of a public easement along a portion of the river or stream bordering or lying within the proposed subdivision.
B. The extent, width and character of the public easement shall be reasonably defined to achieve reasonable public use of the public waterway, river or stream consistent with public safety. The reasonableness and extent of the easement shall be determined by the local agency in which the proposed subdivision is to be located. In making the determination for reasonably defining the extent, width, and character of the public easement, the local agency shall consider all the following:
    1. That the easement may be for a foot trail, bicycle trail or horse trail.
    2. The size of the subdivision.

17.12.050 Exemptions from Access and Easement Requirements.
A. Nothing in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.12.030 and 17.12.040 shall require denial of a tentative or final map when a finding can be made that reasonable public access is otherwise available within a reasonable distance from the subdivision. Any such finding shall be set forth on the face of the map.
B. Nothing in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.12.030 and 17.12.040 shall be construed as requiring the subdivider to improve any route or routes which are primarily for the benefit of nonresidents of the subdivision area or nonowners of the real property in question.
C. Industrial subdivisions shall be exempt from the requirements of Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.12.030 and 17.12.040. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 584 § 1 (part), 1977)

17.12.060 Land Reservation.
Where a park, recreational facility, fire station, library or other public use is shown on an adopted specific plan or the Larkspur General Plan, containing a Community Facilities Element, Recreation and Parks Element and/or a Public Building Element, the subdivider may be required to reserve sites as determined by the City in accordance with the definite principles and standards contained in the above specific plan or General Plan. The reserved area must be of such size and shape as to permit the balance of the property within which the reservation is located to develop in an orderly and efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically unreasonable. The reserved area shall conform to the adopted specific plan or General Plan and shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit an efficient division of the reserved area in the event it is not acquired within the prescribed period. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 2 (part), 1998; Ord. 584 § 1 (part), 1977)

17.12.070 Procedure for Reservation.
The City shall, at the time of approval of the final map or parcel map, enter into a binding agreement with the subdivider to acquire such reserved area within two (2) years after the completion and acceptance of all improvements, unless such period of time is extended by mutual agreement. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 2 (part), 1998; Ord. 584 § 1 (part), 1977)

17.12.080 Payment for Reserved Land.
The purchase price shall be the market value thereof at the time of the filing of the tentative map plus the taxes against such reserved area from the date of the reservation and any other costs incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance of such reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering such reserved area. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 2 (part), 1998; Ord. 584 § 1 (part), 1977)

17.12.090 Bicycle Paths.
As a condition of approval of the subdivision map, the City shall require dedication of bicycle paths for the use and safety of residents of the subdivision, if the subdivision contains two hundred (200) or more parcels. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 2 (part), 1998; Ord. 584 § 1 (part), 1977)

17.12.100 Transit Facilities.
A. As a condition of approval of the subdivision map, the City shall require dedication or irrevocable offer of dedication of land for local transit facilities such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, landing pads and similar items that directly benefit the residents of the subdivision, if:
    1. The subdivision as shown on the tentative map has the potential for two hundred (200) dwelling units or more if developed to the maximum density shown on the adopted General Plan or contains one hundred (100) acres or more; and
    2. The City finds that transit services are or will, within a reasonable time period, be made available to such subdivision.
B. The provisions of this section do not apply to condominium projects which consist of the subdivision of air space in an existing apartment building which is more than five (5) years old when no new dwelling units are added.

Article 1. Authority, Purpose, Definitions

17.13.010 Authority, General Purpose and Definitions.
The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted pursuant to the Government Code Section 66477 and the general police power of the City for the purpose of executing and implementing the General Plan of the City of Larkspur. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for (1) the acquisition of park land for neighborhood and community parks through dedication of land or payment of fees in lieu thereof, and (2) the development of park and recreation facilities by imposition of fees in connection with the development of new dwelling units.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter.
“Developer” includes every person, firm or corporation constructing a new dwelling unit, directly or through the services of any employee, agent, independent contractor, or otherwise.
“New dwelling unit” includes each structure of permanent character, placed in permanent location, which is planned, designed or used for residential occupancy, including, but not limited to, one-family, two-family and multifamily dwellings, apartment houses and complexes, mobile home spaces, and single occupancy units, but not including hotels, motels and boardinghouses for transient guests.
“Subdivision” includes any type of construction, land division or improvement of land which provides for dwelling units identified under the provisions of Government Code Section 66424. “Subdivision” shall also include any increase in the number of mobile home spaces. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

Article 2. Park Land Dedication, Fees In Lieu of Dedication

17.13.020 Requirements.
As a condition of approval of a tentative map or parcel map, rezoning, issuance of a building permit, or other discretionary action granting approval for the development of one or more dwelling units, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof or both, at the option of the City, except as set forth in Government Code Section 66477(g), for neighborhood or community parks or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formulas contained in this chapter. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.030 Park Acreage Standard.
It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety require that five (5) acres of property for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing within this City be devoted to local park and recreational purposes. Such requirements will be satisfied by park land and park dedications pursuant to this article. The acreage of park type per one thousand (1,000) residents shall be determined by the City Council annually by resolution. The adopted park land and park development dedication standard shall reflect the ratio of park land to residents as set forth in Government Code Section 66477. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.040 Formula for Dedication of Land.
Where a park or recreation facility has be designated in the General Plan of the City, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision for the purpose of serving the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the developer shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following formula:
Average No. of persons/Unit × park acreage dedication standard/1,000 population = minimum acreage dedication
Example for single-family dwelling unit (DU):
2.45 × 5/1,000 = .01225 acres/DU
The following table of population density has been established pursuant to Government Code Section 66477 (b):
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|              Population per Dwelling Type                        |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Types of Dwelling                | Average Population Density/DU |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Single-family detached           | 2.45                          |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Single-family attached           | 1.77                          |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Duplex                           | 1.63                          |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Multifamily                      | 1.48                          |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Mobile homes                     | 1.57                          |
+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+
Dedication of land shall be made in accordance with the procedures contained in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.140.
For the purposes of this section, the number of new dwelling units shall be based on the number of parcels indicated on the tentative map or parcel map when in an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel. When all or part of the subdivision is located in an area zoned for more than one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units in the area so zoned shall equal the maximum allowed under that zone, including any applicable density increases. In the case of a condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number of condominium units. The term “new dwelling unit” does not include dwelling units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is filed.
The developer shall, without credit: (1) provide full street improvements and utility connections including, but not limited to, curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees and sidewalks to land which is dedicated pursuant to this section; (2) provide for fencing along the property line of that portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land; (3) provide improved drainage to the site; and (4) provide other minimal improvements which the decision-making body determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational purposes.
The land so dedicated and the improvements to be made pursuant to this section shall be reviewed at the tentative map stage in accordance with the criteria set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.060 and approved by the Recreation Director. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.050 Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication.
A. General Formula. If there is no park or recreation facility designated in the General Plan to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision for the purpose of serving the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the developer shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of that land plus a percentage toward costs of off-site improvements, prescribed for dedication in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.040 and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.070.
B. For the purposes of this chapter, off-site improvements are defined as those improvements which would have been required if land had been dedicated using the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.040. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.060 Criteria for Requiring Both Dedication and Fee.
In subdivisions of more than fifty (50) parcels, the developer shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in accordance with the following formula:
A. When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed in the General Plan as the site for park purposes, such portion shall be dedicated for park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.070 shall be paid for the value of any additional land, plus two hundred (200) percent toward costs of off-site improvements, that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.040. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.070 Amount of Fee in Lieu of Land Dedication.
When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.040 plus a percentage accounting for the cost of improvements such as roads and extension of utility lines. The fee shall be determined by the following formula:
DUs × Pop/DU × Park acreage dedication standard/1,000 people × FMV = Subtotal × x% = in lieu fee
where
DUs = Number of dwelling units as defined in Section 17.13.040.
Pop/DU = Population per dwelling unit.
Park acreage dedication standard = the adopted amount of park land and park development per one thousand (1,000) residents that is required pursuant to this article, as determined by City Council resolution as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.030.
FMV = Fair market value per buildable acre as determined by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.080.
Buildable acre = a typical acre of the subdivision, with a slope less than ten (10) percent, and located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions.
x% = the ratio of the cost of land acquisition and frontage improvements to the FMV.
Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the Recreation Director to ascertain if they comply with the formula set forth above. If compliance is found, then the fees shall be approved by the Recreation Director. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.080 Determination of Fair Market Value.
The fair market value per buildable acre shall be determined annually by resolution adopted by the City Council. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

Article 3. Park Improvement Fees

17.13.090 Requirement, Formula for Park Improvement Fees.
A. General Formula. A fee shall be paid for park land improvement by the developer of each new dwelling unit on property which is subject to the land dedication requirement or the payment of fees in lieu of land dedication as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.13.040 and 17.13.050. This fee shall be used to pay for those improvements including, but not limited to, landscaping and installation of recreational facilities which are not required by Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.13.040 and 17.13.050. The fee shall be determined by the following formula:
DUs × Pop/DU × Park acreage dedication standard/1,000 people × IC/acre = Fee
where
DUs = Number of dwelling units as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.040.
Pop/DU = Population per dwelling unit.
Park acreage dedication standard = the adopted amount of park land and park development per one thousand (1,000) residents that is required pursuant to this article, as determined by City Council resolution as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.030.
IC = Improvement cost per acre of park and recreational facilities. Improvement costs per acre shall be determined as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.100.
B. Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the Recreation Director to ascertain if they comply with the formula set forth above. If compliance is found, then the fees shall be approved by the Recreation Director. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.100 Determination of Park Improvement Cost per Acre.
The improvement cost per acre of park land shall be determined annually by resolution adopted by the City Council. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

Article 4. Park Development Fees

17.13.110 Requirement, Formula for Park Development Fees.
A. General Formula. A fee shall be paid for park development by the developer of each new dwelling unit which is not subject to the following:
    1. The land dedication requirement or the payment of fees in lieu of land dedication as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.13.040 and 17.13.050 or as previously set forth in the Larkspur Municipal Code under the provisions of Government Code Section 664177, the Quimby Act;
    2. The payment of park improvement fees as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.13.090 and 17.13.100. This fee shall be used to pay for park land acquisition and improvements including but not limited to frontage and off-site improvements as described in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.13.030 and 17.13.040 and landscaping and installation of recreational facilities as described in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.090. The fee shall be determined by the following formula.
    DUs × Pop/DU × Park acreage dedication standard/1,000 people × (FMV × x% + IC)/acre = Fee
    where
    DUs = Number of dwelling units as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.040.
    Pop/DU = Population per dwelling unit.
    Park acreage dedication standard = the adopted amount of park land and park development per one thousand (1,000) residents that is required pursuant to this article, as determined by City Council resolution as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.030.
    FMV = Fair market value per buildable acre as determined by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.080.
    Buildable acre = a typical acre of the subdivision with a slope less than ten (10) percent and located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding easements or other restrictions.
    x% = the ratio of the cost of land acquisition and frontage improvements to the FMV.
    IC = improvement cost per acre of park and recreational facilities. Improvement costs per acre shall be determined as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 17.13.100.
B. Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the Recreation Director to ascertain if they comply with the formula set forth above. If compliance is found, then the fees shall be approved by the Recreation Director. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

Article 5. General and Special Provisions

17.13.120 Determination of Land or Fee.
Whether the decision-making body accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:
A. The natural features, access, and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication;
B. The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication;
C. The feasibility of dedication;
D. The compatibility of dedication with the General Plan; and
E. The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.130 Credit for Private Open Space.
Where private open space usable for active recreational purposes is provided in a planned development, real estate development, stock cooperative, and community apartment project, as defined by Business and Professions Code Sections 11003, 11003.1, 11003.2, 11003.4 and 11004, respectively, , and condominiums, as defined in Civil Code Section 783, partial credit, not to exceed forty-five (45) percent shall be given against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the decision-making body finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met:
A. Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and
B. Private park and recreation facilities shall be owned by an owners association composed of all property owners in the subdivision and being an incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only by a seventy-five (75) percent affirmative vote of the membership and approved by the City, operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a charge for a proportionate share of expenses for maintaining the franchise; and
C. Use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreation purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City or its successor; and
D. The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; and
E. The open space for which credit is given is a minimum of three (3) acres and provides a minimum of five (5) of the local park basic elements listed in this section, or a combination of such and other recreation improvements that will meet the specific recreation needs of future residents of the area.

Before credit is given, the decision-making body shall make written findings that the standards set out in this section are met. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.140 Procedure.
At the time of approval of a tentative map or tentative parcel map, rezoning, issuance of a building permit, or any other discretionary approval of development, the decision-making body shall, pursuant to this chapter, require the dedication of land or payment of fees in-lieu thereof and the payment of fees for park improvement, or the payment of fees for park development.
Dedications of land shall be made on the final subdivision map. Fees in-lieu of land dedication, fees for park improvement and fees for park development shall be calculated and paid at the time of issuance of the building permit using (1) the formulas set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.13.070, 17.13.090 and 17.13.110; (2) the most currently adopted land values and park development costs; and (3) the most currently adopted park acreage dedication standard.
Open space covenants for private park or recreation facilities shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the final or parcel map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final or parcel map. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.150 Disposition of Fees.
Fees determined pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.13.070 and 17.13.090 shall be paid to the Finance Director and shall be deposited into the City trust fund or its successor. Money in the fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for acquisition, development or rehabilitation of park land or improvements related thereto.
Collected fees shall be appropriated by the City for a specific project to serve residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five (5) years after the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later.
If such fees are not so committed, these fees shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lots bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision.
The Finance Director shall report to the City Council at least annually the income, expenditures and status of the City service trust funds. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.160 Exemptions.
Subdivisions containing less than five (5) parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit.
Previously developed parcels which have been vacant for less than three (3) years prior to the issuance of a building permit for residential development shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter.
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivision; nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision or airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five (5) years old when no new dwelling units are added.
The City Council may by resolution, waive the payment of park dedication in lieu, park improvement and/or park development fees for mobile homes upon making findings of fact that the exemption will promote one or more goals of the Housing Element of the General Plan.
The City Council may, by resolution, waive the payment of park dedication in lieu, park improvement and/or park development fees upon making findings of fact that the dwelling unit(s) for which the waiver is requested is affordable housing as defined by the Housing Element of the General Plan. The City Council may establish additional qualifying criteria for affordable housing fee waivers. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.170 Developer-Provided Park and Recreation Improvements.
After the decision-making body determines the land required for dedication and/or in-lieu fee payment by the developer, the developer may apply to the Recreation Department and Public Works Department for permission to construct specified park and recreation improvements on land of the developer required for dedication to be developed as park. If the Recreation Department and Public Works Department grants the developer permission for construction of specified parks and recreation improvements on the land, the Departments shall fix the dollar value of the parks and recreation improvements approved by the Departments. The dollar value of park and recreation improvements provided by the developer in the manner described in this chapter shall be credited against the fees required by this chapter.

The Recreation Department and Public Works Department shall develop a schedule specifying how, when and where it will use the land or fees or both, to develop park or recreational facilities to serve residents of the subdivision. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.190 Access.
All land offered for dedication for local park or recreational purposes shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street. This requirement may be waived by the decision-making body if the decision-making body determines that public street access is unnecessary for maintenance of the park area or use thereof by residents. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.200 Sale of Dedicated Land.
If during the ensuing time between dedication of land for park purposes and commencement of first-stage development, circumstances arise which indicate that another site would be more suitable for local park or recreational purposes serving the subdivision and the neighborhood (such as receipt of a gift of additional park land), the land may be sold upon the approval of the decision-making body with the resultant funds being used for the purchase of a more suitable site. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

17.13.210 Criteria for Acceptance of Public Open Space.
The City Council may accept and maintain open space lands that promote public health, safety and welfare.
Said open space lands must provide substantial public use and one or more of the following: (1) contiguity to existing parks or open space areas; (2) major linkage between parks or open space areas; (3) a major off-street trail or pathway system which connects, or has the potential to connect, to other trails; (4) valuable pedestrian experience on its own; and/or (5) public access to creeks or protection of creeks of public benefit. Other open space, such as hillsides or ridgelines with minimal public access potential, should be protected by other techniques. Provision of open space accepted pursuant to this section that is protected by other techniques shall not be credited against the provision of park and recreational land or in-lieu fees as determined by this chapter nor shall in any way displace the need for provision of adequate usable park space per this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall limit the offer of land by dedication or donation and acceptance thereof by provisions outside this chapter. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 896 § 3 (part), 1998)

For subdivisions requiring a parcel map, a preliminary soils report may be required if the City Engineer or Planning Commission determines that a soils problem or soils-related hazard may exist. The preliminary soils report may be divided into the following two (2) segments:
    1. Soils Reconnaissance. The reconnaissance shall include but not be limited to a complete description of the site based on a field investigation as related to soils matters such as stability, erosion, settlement, feasibility of construction of the proposed improvements, descriptions of soils-related hazards and problems, and proposed methods of eliminating or reducing such hazards and problems. Two (2) copies of the soils reconnaissance shall be filed with the tentative map.
    2. Detailed Soils Investigation and Report. The investigation and report shall include field investigation and laboratory tests with detailed information and recommendations relative to all aspects of grading, filling and other earthwork; foundation design; pavement design and subsurface drainage. The report shall also recommend any required corrective action for the purpose of preventing structural damages to the subdivision improvements and the structures to be constructed on the lots and, in addition, shall also recommend any special precautions required for erosion control and the prevention of sedimentation or damage to off-site property. If such preliminary soils report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soils problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, then a soils investigation of each lot in the subdivision may be required for submittal to the City Engineer prior to approval of a final map or parcel map. Two (2) copies of the investigation and report shall be filed with the improvement plans.
B. A final soils report shall be required where a preliminary soils report was required, unless such final report is waived in writing by the City Engineer. The final soils report shall contain sufficient information to ensure compliance with all recommendations of the preliminary soils report and the specifications for the project. The final report shall also contain any new soils condition information which differs from that in the preliminary reports and any corrections, additions or modifications not showing on the approved plans. One copy of the report shall be filed with both the City Engineer and Building Inspector prior to preliminary acknowledgment of completion of the improvements.
C. When conditions warrant, a geologic investigation and report may also be required. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 584 § 1 (part), 1977)

The purpose of this chapter is to establish a procedure for the approval of a tentative map that provides certain statutorily vested rights to a subdivider under the Vesting Tentative Map Statute (Government Code Section 66498.1 et seq.). This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority of that statute, implements and supplements that statute, the Subdivision Map Act and this title. To accomplish the purpose, this chapter is necessary to preserve the public health, safety and general welfare.
This chapter may be cited as the Vesting Tentative Map Ordinance. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

17.26.020 Definitions.
In this chapter:
A. “Vesting tentative map” is a tentative map for a residential subdivision which has been filed, processed and approved in accordance with the Vesting Tentative Map Statute and this chapter and which has printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map”;
B. All other definitions set forth in this title shall apply. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

17.26.025 Consistency.
No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the Larkspur General Plan and any applicable specific plan or not permitted by the zoning ordinance or other applicable provisions of the Larkspur Municipal Code. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

17.26.030 Applicability.
This chapter applies only to residential subdivisions. Beginning January 1, 1988, this chapter will also apply to nonresidential subdivisions. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

17.26.040 Procedure.
A. Option to File Vesting Tentative Map. When a tentative map is required, a subdivider has the option to file a vesting tentative map instead, provided all requirements of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute and this chapter are met.
B. Filing. A vesting tentative map shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map” before the City may accept it for filing.
C. Subdivision Ordinance Applies. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, this title applies to a vesting tentative map and a vesting tentative map is processed in the same manner and is subject to the same time periods as a tentative map.
D. Accompanying Data. A subdivider shall provide the following as part of the application for a vesting tentative map:
    1. Information which is required for the filing of an ordinary tentative map; and
    2. A filing fee in an amount established by the City Council; and
    3. Evidence of having secured all necessary City land use permits, planned unit development permits, variances and design review approval as required by the Larkspur Municipal Code; and
    4. All information required by resolution adopted by the City Council in accordance with this chapter and the Vesting Tentative Map Statute. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

17.26.050 Development Rights.
A. Development Rights Created. The approval of a vesting tentative map confers a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the City’s ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the date the City determines the application is complete.
B. Duration of Development Rights. The right to proceed with development as set forth in subsection (A) of this section continues for one year following the recordation of the final map or parcel map. If a project covered by a single vesting tentative map is divided into phases and more than one final map is recorded, the one-year period begins for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.
C. Expiration of Development Rights. 
    1. The right to proceed with development as set forth in subsection (A) of this section expires if a final map is not approved before the vesting tentative map expires.
    2. The time within which a final map may be filed is governed by Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 17.24.110 and 17.24.120, and Government Code Sections 66452.6(a), (d) and (e).
    3. If, during the one-year period specified in subsection (B) of this section, the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit on one or more lots within the subdivision, the right to proceed with development on those lots continues until the building permit on those lots expires.
    4. If a final map is recorded based upon a vesting tentative map and the development rights expire, the final map remains in effect without the development rights.
D. Extension of Time for Exercise of Development Rights. 
    1. If the City does not process an application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review within thirty (30) days of the date the application is complete, the one-year period specified in subsection (B) of this section is automatically extended by the time exceeding the thirty-day period used by the City to complete processing.
    2. Before the expiration of the one-year period specified in subsection (B) of this section a subdivider may apply to the Planning Commission for a one-year extension. A decision of the Planning Commission granting or denying an extension may be appealed to the City Council by filing a written notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days of the Commission’s decision. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

17.26.060 Effect of State and Federal Laws.
This chapter relates only to the imposition of conditions and requirements imposed by the City and does not affect the obligation of a subdivider to comply with the conditions and requirements of state or federal laws, regulations or policies. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

17.26.070 City’s Right to Condition or Deny Approval.
A. This chapter does not:
    1. Enlarge or diminish the types of conditions which the City may impose on a development; or
    2. Diminish or alter the City’s power to protect against a condition dangerous to the public health or safety.
B. The City may condition or deny a permit, approval, extension or entitlement relating to a vesting tentative map if it determines that either:
    1. The failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the community in a condition dangerous to their health or safety; or
    2. The condition or denial is required to comply with state or federal law. (Ord. 1030 § 2(11), 2018; Ord. 730 § II, 1985)

Easements for storm drains, sewers and other purposes shall be designated by dotted lines. Distances and bearings on the side lines of lots which are cut by an easement must be arrowed or so shown that the map will indicate clearly the actual lengths of the lot lines.

    1. Construction of, or addition to, a single-family dwelling on a legal R-1 zoned lot existing prior to the effective date of this section, June 18, 1986.
    2. Construction of, or addition to, an existing emergency shelter in the A-P Zoning District or any Planned Development District where A-P uses are permitted.
C. When a question as to the applicability of these regulations arises, the proponents must demonstrate to the Planning Commission that these standards do not apply to their project.
D. The City shall use the most recently published edition of “Trip Generation” by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) to assess the application standards of this section. The City may accept other sources of traffic generation figures for unique land uses. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 981 § 2, 2011; Ord. 838 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.14.060 Application.
Application for a circulation assessment permit shall include:
A. An application form provided by the Planning Department that has been signed by the property owner or authorized representative;
B. A site location map showing the location of the project and the City’s primary circulation system;
C. The project’s preliminary site plan showing structures, parking, and circulation;
D. Preliminary floor plans;
E. A preliminary traffic analysis which indicates that the project is not an applicable project as defined by the criteria in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.14.050 or if the project is an applicable project a traffic impact study of the project as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.14.070.
F. Deposits as required by the Planning Department to cover the time and expense of the City in the review and processing of the application. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 838 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.14.070 Traffic Impact Study.
The application for a circulation assessment permit shall be accompanied by a traffic study that is found by the City’s Traffic Engineer to be complete and in compliance with professional standards for such reports. The Planning Commission may request clarification or expansion of any of the material that is submitted. When a traffic study is required in conjunction with environmental review documents mandated by the California Environmental Quality Act, such study shall be prepared by or under the authority of the City.
A. The study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
    1. A description of the project and the existing traffic and circulation setting;
    2. For the intersections and roadway segments identified in subsection (C) of this section, an assessment shall be made of:
        a. Daily traffic volumes including existing traffic, existing traffic plus projected traffic, and existing traffic plus projected traffic plus project traffic.
        b. AM and PM peak hour traffic volumes including existing traffic, existing traffic plus projected traffic, and existing traffic plus projected traffic plus project traffic.
        c. For intersections, the AM and PM peak hour level of service and capacity analysis.
    3. For development projects where there is an existing use on the project site the study shall determine the actual existing trip generation for the site and shall also determine the average existing trip generation for the site using the trips rates from the ITE “Trip Generation Manual” or, should the existing use of the site not be included in the ITE manual, using trip generation rates as recommended by the City Traffic Engineer.
    4. For development projects north of Corte Madera Creek where there is an existing use on the project site and where the projected trip generation would exceed the average PM peak hour trip generation, the traffic study shall include trip mitigation measures, such as Transportation Systems Management (TSM), which would describe how future project trip generation could be managed so that it would be no greater than the average PM peak hour trip generation at the project site. The traffic study and trip generation mitigation measures shall apply to minimize the traffic impacts to the extent feasible, but an exception to the “no greater than the average existing PM peak hour trip generation at the project site” shall be considered for the residential portion of development projects where either:
        a. No less than fifteen (15) percent of units are dedicated to very low-income housing and ten (10) percent to low-income housing and twenty-five (25) percent to moderate-income housing; or
        b. Fifty (50) percent of units are dedicated to senior/disabled housing.
    5. Projections of future levels of service shall be conducted assuming existing roadway geometrics and also accounting for those traffic and circulation system improvements as shown on the programmed transportation system improvements list.
B. The report shall be appended with the total listings of traffic counts and the intersection capacity worksheets.
C. Scope. The report shall address all of the intersections and roadways of the City’s primary circulation system for which the project is expected to increase the existing peak hour traffic volumes of any approach or segment by one percent of existing traffic volumes or by ten (10) cars, whichever is less. The City shall determine the scope.
D. Methodology. The methodology to be used in the traffic study shall be that set by the City. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 939 § 1, 2004; Ord. 838 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.14.080 Traffic Impact Fee.
The traffic impact fee (TIF) as described in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.15 shall be applicable to all projects which apply for and receive a circulation assessment permit under the provisions of this chapter. The payment of the traffic impact fee shall be considered by the City as mitigation of the project’s impacts on the primary circulation system as are described in the project traffic impact study, Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.14.070. The City may also require project specific transportation improvements, both on site and off site, in addition to the payment of the traffic impact fee. The City may also require a project sponsor to prepare a Transportation Systems Management (TSM) Program in addition to making payment of the traffic impact fee. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 838 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.14.090 Planning Commission Hearing.
A. The circulation assessment permit shall be presented to the Planning Commission at a duly noticed public hearing. The CAP hearing can be held simultaneously with any other discretionary approvals being considered by the Commission in connection with the project in question.
B. This hearing shall be noticed as required for the discretionary approval or if other hearings are not otherwise required, the CAP hearing shall be noticed as required for a use permit.
C. The Planning Commission will approve, approve with conditions or modifications, or deny the permit application. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 838 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.14.100 Required Findings.
To approve the circulation assessment permit, the Planning Commission must make finding A of this section, that the project is consistent with the Larkspur General Plan, and must make at least one additional finding from findings B, C, D, E, or F as listed in this section.
A. The project is consistent with the Larkspur General Plan and, as applicable, with the Downtown Specific Plan or other specific plans.
B. The project’s projected peak hour trip generation will not exceed the average existing peak hour trip generation which results when the trip generation rates as described in the ITE “Trip Generation Manual” are applied to the existing use on the project site.
C. The project’s traffic, when added to the existing traffic plus projected traffic, will not cause the performance of intersections or roadway linkages to fall below acceptable level of service standards or otherwise significantly further reduce the system performance if it is already below the acceptable level of service, nor will it cause a significant degradation in service levels for impacted intersections at their peak traffic periods. Significant intersection service level degradation is defined as an increase of 0.01 or more in the peak hour volume to capacity (V/C) ratio as calculated under the planning procedures for signalized intersections in the Transportation Research Circular 212.
D. The agreement by the project sponsor to provide the project specific transportation system improvements as may be required by the City and to pay traffic impact fees as described in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.15 which will provide the project’s proportionate share of the funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements as shown on the programmed transportation improvements list will adequately mitigate the project’s adverse impacts.
E. The project’s peak hour traffic will not increase the traffic volume on any roadway segment or intersection approach of the City’s primary circulation system by more than one percent of the existing traffic volume or by more than ten (10) vehicles, whichever is less.
F. The project will provide an overriding public benefit that will sufficiently offset its adverse traffic impacts. Any affirmative decision of the Planning Commission or the City Council based upon this finding must be approved by a four-fifths majority. The grounds for making this finding must be set forth in the approving motion. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 838 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.010 Intent and Purpose.
The City Council of the City of Larkspur finds that as a result of increasing regional growth, significant residential, commercial office and industrial development is expected to occur within the City. This anticipated development, including development currently approved or submitted for approval, cumulatively will generate a substantial increase over existing levels of traffic within the City. This increase in traffic will result in traffic volumes which exceed the capacity of the existing City-wide transportation system to provide acceptable levels of service.
The City Council also finds that unless certain actions are taken, the above factors will result in adverse impacts such as unacceptable levels of congestion on streets and at intersections, traffic accidents, air pollution, noise and restrictions on access for emergency vehicles. To prevent these undesirable consequences, the capacity of the City-wide transportation system must be expanded at a rate which will accommodate the expected growth in the City.
The City Council also finds that, in the absence of this ordinance imposing a traffic impact fee, existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund a substantial portion of the improvements required to meet the goals, objectives, policies and programs identified in the Transportation Element of the General Plan.
Accordingly, it is the intent of the City Council to adopt by this chapter a fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to fund the construction and implementation of improvements to the City-wide transportation system sufficient to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by new development at acceptable levels of service throughout the City. This chapter is adopted pursuant to and to comply with Government Code Section 66000 et seq.
It is also the intent of the City Council that the adoption of this chapter will assist the City to meet the goals of the Larkspur General Plan, including, but not limited to, preserving the historic character of the community, and avoiding the disruption of neighborhoods from through traffic. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.020 Additional Findings.
The City Council further finds as follows:
A. The Land Use Element of the Larkspur General Plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the City and places limits on the intensity and density of such use.
B. The City Council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the General Plan and the Downtown Specific Plan. Based upon this examination, the City Council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the City Council to project, with substantial certainty, the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the City’s General Plan and Downtown Specific Plan.
C. The City Council also has examined the extent to which different land uses generate vehicle trips. The City Council, in evaluating these trip generation rates, has taken into consideration, among other things, the General Plan Technical Studies, the City-wide Traffic Study, and various reports and memorandums by staff and consultants regarding trip generation rates. The City Council finds that these trip generation rates represent a reasonable estimate of the actual trip generation rates for these land use categories.
D. The City has identified certain major street and interchange improvements, transit way projects and other traffic-related improvements which are necessary or appropriate to accommodate the new development described in the City’s General Plan. The Larkspur General Plan and the City-wide Traffic Study indicate that build-out of the development permitted under the General Plan will result in unacceptable levels of service at many of the key intersections identified in the report. The City Council finds that this level of congestion will have adverse effects throughout the City and that implementation of the Transportation Element will substantially reduce these adverse effects.
E. Full implementation of the Transportation Element will require the construction of major improvements to the existing City-wide transportation system. The City Council has, after review of all relevant information, determined the estimated reasonable cost of those improvements and estimated funds available to make such improvements, as well as the extent to which funding is inadequate to make the necessary improvements.
F. The City Council, in determining the extent to which funds are available to make transportation improvements, has evaluated present and future sources of federal, state and county funding, City revenues which are earmarked for transportation improvements, and the extent to which committed projects are required to construct or fund transportation improvements that will assist in the implementation of the Transportation Element. The City is committed to actively pursuing all available funding sources for transportation improvements, in cooperation with interested members of the development community.
G. Although the traffic volume generated by an individual development project may not be, in and of itself, sufficient to overload the existing City-wide transportation system, the cumulative impact of all new development permitted under the City’s General Plan (including development currently approved or submitted for approval) will result in unacceptable levels of congestion. Implementation of the Transportation Element will result in a significant reduction in the level of traffic congestion generated by new development. It is the policy of the City, as set forth in the Transportation Element, that new development pay for the cost of the improvements to the City-wide transportation system which are identified in the Transportation Element and the City-wide Traffic Study and are necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by new development. For these reasons, a fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to construct the required transportation improvements is to impose a traffic impact fee based on the extent to which new development generates additional traffic volumes.
H. The transportation improvements will be constructed or implemented with funds generated by this chapter and will significantly benefit the contributor in that the adverse impacts, such as noise, air pollution, delay, accidents, increased fuel consumption, harm to the local economy, and inconveniences caused by traffic congestion will be substantially mitigated. The inability or failure to reduce the adverse impacts caused by traffic congestion in all parts of the City will have adverse effects throughout the City.
I. The City Council further finds that all portions of the existing local street system, except as noted below, currently operate at acceptable service levels. The funds collected under this chapter shall be exclusively used to mitigate the impacts of the trips generated by new development within the City. The following intersections have been identified as currently operating below acceptable service levels and in accord with the policies of the General Plan will not be improved in order to resolve the existing congestion problems.
    1. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at Eliseo Drive.
    2. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at La Cuesta Drive.
    3. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard at Bon Air Road.
J. The City Council further finds that the traffic fees to be charged pursuant to this chapter do not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of implementing the Transportation Element, that implementation of the Transportation Element is necessary to reduce the traffic congestion which will be created by new development, and that the method of allocation adopted by this chapter which is based upon the trip generation rates for the land uses permitted under the City’s General Plan assures that the fee applicable to a particular development bears a fair and reasonable relationship to each such development’s burden on, and benefit from, the City-wide transportation improvements to be funded by this chapter.
K. Periodic review, and possible revision, of the resolutions adopted by the City Council pursuant to this chapter will allow for the adjustment of the fees to be paid under this chapter to ensure that those fees are fair and equitable and that the traffic fees imposed pursuant to this chapter continue to reflect the reasonable cost of implementing the Transportation Element. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

(Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.050 Rate of Fee.
A. The rate of the traffic impact fee shall be calculated in accordance with the procedure set forth in this section and shall be established by resolution of the City Council as that resolution may be amended from time to time pursuant to subsection (E) of this section enacted after a properly noticed public hearing and shall be effective no sooner than sixty (60) days after the resolution is adopted.
B. The City Council shall determine by resolution the transportation system improvement costs as follows:
    1. The City Council shall adopt the programmed transportation system improvements that are necessary to implement the Transportation Element and reduce the adverse impacts caused by the increased traffic volume generated by development.
    2. The City Council shall make a reasonable estimate of the total costs necessary to construct or provide the programmed transportation system improvements.
    3. The City Council shall estimate the current and anticipated funding available to satisfy the costs of constructing and implementing the programmed transportation system improvements.

E. Once every twelve (12) months, or more frequently if it deems it necessary, the City Council shall review the development assumptions, the peak hour trip generation, the transportation system improvements costs and the cost per trip and, if necessary, amend the resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter to ensure that the traffic impact fee remains a fair and equitable method for the distribution of costs of constructing or providing the transportation improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by development. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.060 Calculation of Fee.
A. The traffic impact fee shall be calculated as follows:
TRAFFIC IMPACT FEE = SIZE OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECT × PEAK HOUR TRIP RATE × RATE OF FEE.
B. The amount of the fee shall be calculated at the time of payment of the fee. The calculation of the fee shall be based on the peak hour trip rate and rate of fee in effect at the time of the payment of the fee. The size of the development project shall be determined as follows:
    1. If the fee is paid prior to construction of the development project, the size of the project shall be as given in the CAP Traffic Study, Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.14.070, or in other permit applications if a CAP is not required.
    2. If the fee is paid following construction of the project, the size of the project shall be the actual gross floor area or the number of residential units constructed.
C. The traffic impact fee for either (1) the reuse of an existing building, or (2) the replacement of an existing building by a new structure shall account for the prior use of the project site if the new use will commence within five (5) years of the termination of the prior use. The fee shall be based on the difference between the trip rate for the new use or building and that of the immediate prior use(s) of the building. This calculation shall apply only when the building permit for the new use is issued no later than five (5) years from the date of the last active use of the prior building.
D. Each developer may submit additional information that the City shall consider insofar as it is relevant to establishing the peak hour trip rate applicable to the development project. Following review of all pertinent studies and submittals, the City shall determine the appropriate peak hour trip rate to be used for each project.
E. The amount of the traffic impact fee determined in accordance with this section shall be considered by the City as mitigation of the project’s impact on the City-wide transportation system. The City may also require project site specific transportation system improvements in addition to the payment of the traffic impact fee. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.070 Payment of Fee.
A. The full amount of the traffic impact fee determined in accordance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.15.060 shall be paid at the times set forth in this section.
B. The traffic impact fee may be paid at any time following the issuance of a Circulation Assessment Permit (CAP), Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.14, but must be made prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit by the City.
C. No City official or agency may issue a certificate of occupancy for a development project until the traffic impact fee with respect to such development required by this chapter is paid in accordance with this section. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.080 Use of Funds.
The fees paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be set aside by the City in a special revenue fund in a manner to record the fees separate from other revenues or funds of the City, and record any expenditures for the purpose of constructing or providing only the programmed transportation system improvements listed in the resolution adopted pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.15.050(B). Any interest income earned on the fund shall also be deposited therein and shall only be expended for the purposes set forth in this section. The City Council shall review annually fund balances, projected revenues and required transportation improvements and make a determination for use of the funds as a part of the Capital Improvement Plan and Annual Budget, or the refunding of all or a portion thereof, as may be required by state and local law. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.090 Refunds.
A. Refunds asked of the City may be made where:
    1. The building permit expires and no extensions have been granted for a development for which the fee required under this chapter has been collected; provided, that the claim for such refund is filed no later than one year after the expiration date of the building permit or any extension thereof as may have been approved by the City, as the case may be; or
    2. A refund is specifically authorized by resolution of the City Council adopted pursuant to Government Code Section 66001(d). Such amounts shall be refunded by City to the then-current record owner or owners of the development on a prorated basis. The City may effect such refunding by direct payment, by providing a temporary suspension of fees, or by any other means consistent with the intent of Government Code Section 66001. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.100 Appeals.
A developer may appeal to the City Council any determination made pursuant to this chapter, pursuant to provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 2.50. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 853 § 5 (part), 1993; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.15.110 Supplementary Provisions.
It is the intent of the City Council that the fees required by this chapter shall be supplementary to the fees, dedications or conditions imposed upon development pursuant to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, California Environmental Quality Act and other state laws and City ordinances or policies which may authorize the imposition of fees, dedications or conditions thereon. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 840 § 1 (part), 1992)

18.25.040 Residential Development Project: Inclusionary/In-Lieu Fee Requirements.
A. Inclusionary Requirement. 
    1. In a residential development of five (5) to fourteen (14) units, at least fifteen (15) percent of all dwelling units shall be affordable, and shall be constructed and completed not later than the related market rate units, as follows:
        a. In a rental housing project the affordable units shall be affordable to very low- and low-income households.
        b. In a for-sale project the affordable units shall be affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
    2. In a residential development of fifteen (15) or more units, at least twenty (20) percent of all dwelling units shall be affordable as outlined above in subsection (A)(1)(a) and (b) of this section, and shall be constructed and completed not later than the related market rate units.
    3. In subdivisions of two (2) or more parcels, where five (5) or more additional housing units could be developed, developable parcels shall be set aside to allow for the future development of the equivalent percentages of affordable units as outlined above. The applicant or another for-profit or nonprofit applicant may develop the land. The units built on the parcels may be rental or owner-occupied, and shall be in compliance with this chapter. The method of providing inclusionary units from lot subdivisions shall be specified in the conditions of approval of each applicable subdivision.
    Notwithstanding the above, this section shall not apply to projects which fall into one or more of the following categories:
        a. A residential development project to the extent it has received a vested right to proceed without payment of housing impact fees pursuant to state law.
        b. Building permits for residential development projects if compliance with this section for such project has already been satisfied including, but not limited to, building permits on newly created lots where the subdivider has built affordable units or otherwise satisfied this section.
        c. Any dwelling unit or residential development project which is damaged or destroyed by fire or other calamity so long as the square footage and use of the building remains the same.
B. For fractions of required affordable units, the developer may elect, at his or her option, to construct the next higher whole number of affordable units, perform an equivalency action alternative which has received the approval of Council pursuant to subsection (C) of this section, or pay the in-lieu fee specified in subsection (D) of this section for such fraction.
C. Alternative Equivalent Action. 
    1. A developer of a residential development project may propose to meet the requirements of subsection (A) of this section by an alternative equivalent action, subject to the review and approval by the City Council.
    2. An alternative equivalent action may include, but is not limited to, dedication of vacant land suitable for housing to a nonprofit housing development (see subsection (C)(2)(a) of this section), transfer of inclusionary unit credits (see subsection (C)(2)(b) of this section), construction of affordable units on another site or enforcement of required rental/sales price restrictions on existing market-rate dwelling units consistent with this section, and development of second dwelling units (see subsection (C)(2)(c) of this section).
    All applicants proposing the use of an alternative equivalent action shall show how the alternative will further affordable housing opportunities in the City to an equal or greater extent than compliance with the express requirements of subsection (A) of this section.
        a. Land Donation. Upon approval of the City Council, an applicant may donate land to a nonprofit housing developer in place of actual construction of required affordable units. The dedicated land must be appropriately zoned, buildable (e.g., fully improved as noted below), and free of toxic substances and contaminated soils as defined by the State Department of Toxic Substances Control. The land must be large enough to accommodate the number of required affordable units as indicated by a conceptual development plan.

The City Council may approve issuance of a credit certificate for each affordable unit provided by a particular residential development project in excess of the minimum number required for the project and it may establish a cap on the value of the certificates. Credit certificates shall be issued for specific income categories and may only be used to satisfy the requirements for affordable units within that same income category. If the holder of the credit certificates transfers any or all certificates to a developer of a residential development project, the parties shall report the transaction to the Planning Director, who will document the transfer. When a credit certificate is applied to meet the affordable unit requirement of a particular project, it shall be recorded at the time of project approval, and subject certificates shall be returned to the Planning Director.
        c. Second Dwelling Units. Not more than fifty (50) percent of the requirements of this chapter may be satisfied through the development of second dwelling units at a ratio of two (2) second dwelling units counted as one affordable housing unit. All second units counted toward meeting the affordable unit requirement shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (K) of this section, Continued Affordability.
    3. The City Council’s consideration of an alternative equivalent action shall follow the procedures outlined in subsection (G) of this section. An alternative equivalent action shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the City Council and may be approved at the City Council’s sole discretion, if the City Council determines that such alternative will further affordable housing opportunities in the City to an equal or greater extent than compliance with the express requirements of subsection (A) of this section.

    1. For fractions of required affordable units for a residential development of fifteen (15) or more units, an applicant may pay the in-lieu fee equivalent to one whole unit.
    2. For a residential development of five (5) to fourteen (14) units and which is not, and has not been, part of a larger residential project, an applicant may propose to meet the requirements of subsection (A) of this section by submitting at the time of application for a discretionary approval or building permit, whichever comes first, a request to pay the in-lieu fee along with a report identifying:
        a. All overriding conditions impacting the project that prevent the development from meeting the requirement to construct the affordable units;
        b. Sufficient independent data, including appropriate financial information, that supports the developer’s claim that it is not feasible to construct the required affordable units; and
        c. A detailed analysis of why the concessions and incentives identified in subsection (G) of this section will not mitigate the identified overriding conditions that are preventing the construction of the affordable units.
    3. The City Council’s consideration of an in-lieu housing fee for a residential development of five (5) to fourteen (14) units shall follow the procedures outlined in subsection (G) of this section. In-lieu housing fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the City Council and may be approved at the City Council’s sole discretion, if the Council determines that there are overriding conditions impacting the project that prevent the developer of a residential development project from meeting the requirement to construct affordable units and that payment of the in-lieu fee will further affordable housing opportunities.
E. Time of Payment of In-Lieu Fee. Unless otherwise preempted by law, the housing in-lieu fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit.
F. Calculation of Housing In-Lieu Fee. The amount and calculation of the housing in-lieu fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
G. Affordable Housing Concessions and Incentives. For residential development projects, which meet the requirements of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.26.010 et seq., concessions and incentives shall be awarded as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.26. Density bonuses, concessions, and incentives shall only be given to residential development projects that actually construct new affordable housing or dedicate land for affordable housing, as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.26. Residential development projects paying only in-lieu fees or obtaining or using inclusionary unit credits shall not be eligible for density bonuses, concessions, or incentives.
H. Requirements for Rental Affordable Units. 
    1. One-half of the affordable units, which are required to be constructed in connection with construction of rental market rate units, shall be available at affordable rents to very low-income households. The remaining one-half of the required affordable units shall be available at affordable rents to low-income households. Where the number of required affordable units is an odd number, the number of affordable units constructed for very low-income households may be one less than the number of affordable units constructed for low-income households.
    2. With respect to any particular rental residential project, the City Council may, upon the recommendation of the City Manager, forgive all or a portion of the affordability requirement set forth in subsection (A) of this section upon a showing by the applicant that imposition of such requirement on the residential project will cause undue hardship and that such residential project will contribute significantly to affordable housing opportunities in the City.
I. Requirements for Owner-Occupied Affordable Units. One-half of the affordable units, which are required to be constructed in connection with the construction of market rate units, intended for owner-occupancy shall be available at affordable sales prices to moderate-income households whose annual household income does not exceed one hundred twenty (120) percent of median income. The remaining one-half of the required affordable units shall be available at affordable sales prices to households whose annual household income does not exceed eighty (80) percent of median income. Where the number of required affordable units is an odd number, the number of units affordable to moderate-income households may be one greater than the number affordable at or below eighty (80) percent of median income.
J. Basic Requirements for Owner-Occupied and Rental Affordable Units. Affordable units shall be comparable in number of bedrooms, exterior appearance and overall quality of construction to market rate units in the same residential project. Subject to the approval of the Planning Commission through the design review process, square footage of affordable units and interior features in affordable units are not required to be the same as or equivalent to those in market rate units in the same residential project, so long as they are of good quality and are consistent with contemporary standards for new housing. Affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the residential project, or, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission, may be clustered within the residential project when this furthers affordable housing opportunities.
K. Continued Affordability. 
    1. Prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy or approval of the final inspection for affordable units, regulatory agreements and, if the affordable units are owner-occupied, resale restrictions, deeds of trust and/or other documents, all of which must be acceptable to the City Manager and consistent with the requirements of this chapter, shall be recorded against parcels having such affordable units and shall be effective in perpetuity, unless reduced by the City Council to a specific term to meet the requirements of a financing institution or subsidy program, with respect to each affordable unit.
    2. The following shall apply during the affordability period for an affordable unit subject to this chapter:
        a. The maximum sales price permitted on resale of an affordable unit intended for owner-occupancy shall not exceed the seller’s purchase price, adjusted for the percentage increase in median income since the seller’s purchase, plus the cost of substantial structural or permanent fixed improvements to the property, plus the cost of reasonable seller’s broker fee as determined by the City Manager.
        b. The resale restrictions shall provide that, in the event of the sale of an affordable unit intended for owner-occupancy, the City shall have the right to purchase or assign its right to purchase such affordable unit at the maximum price which could be charged to an eligible household.
    3. No household shall be permitted to occupy an affordable unit, or purchase an affordable unit for owner-occupancy, unless the City or its designee has approved the household’s eligibility, or has failed to make a determination of eligibility within the time or other limits provided by a regulatory agreement or resale restrictions.
    If the City or its designee maintains a list of eligible households, households selected to occupy affordable units shall be selected first from that list to the extent provided in the regulatory agreement or resale restrictions.
    4. For any affordable unit that is no longer restricted at the time of the sale, the seller is only entitled to the maximum sales price permitted as defined in subsection (K)(2)(a) of this section. The proceeds above and beyond that shall be placed back into the housing fund and used as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.25.030(B).
    5. If the City granted concessions at the time of a development, the City shall recapture its proportionate share of appreciation. For purposes of this subsection, the City’s proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the discount given to make a unit affordable divided by the fair market value of the unit at the time of the initial sale; such fair market value shall be documented through an appraisal of the property by a qualified appraiser and provided to the City by the developer. This amount shall be placed into the housing fund and used as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.25.030(B).
L. Annual Monitoring and Transfer Fees. 
    1. For each rental affordable unit provided hereunder, the current owner may be required to pay an annual monitoring fee for the term of required affordability. Such fee shall be specified in the regulatory agreement(s) required hereunder.
    2. For each owner-occupied affordable unit provided under this section, the current owner may be required to pay a transfer fee for any change of ownership during the term of required affordability. Such fee shall be specified in the resale restrictions required by subsection (K) of this section.
M. Discretionary Permit Requirements. Every discretionary permit for a residential development project of five (5) or more units approved after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall contain a condition detailing the method of compliance with this chapter. Every final and parcel map shall bear a note indicating compliance with the requirements of this section must be met prior to issuance of a building permit for each lot created by such map.
N. Professional Assistance for City Review and Determinations. Whenever an approval or determination is required, the Planning Director may, at the applicant’s sole cost and expense, retain a suitably qualified independent professional consultant to evaluate the adequacy of the application to achieve the purposes of this chapter.
O. Requirements for Certificate of Occupancy/Final Inspection. 
    1. No temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, final inspection approved or release of utilities authorized for any new dwelling unit in a residential development project until the developer has satisfactorily completed the requirements hereunder, i.e., on-site construction of affordable units, alternative equivalent action(s) or payment of the housing in-lieu fee.
    2. No temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, final inspection approved or release of utilities authorized for a dwelling unit described as exempt from the requirements of this chapter in subsection (A) of this section until the developer has made a showing acceptable to the City Manager that such an exemption is appropriate. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 1, 2015; Ord. 941 § 1, 2005. Formerly 18.31.040)

18.25.050 Enforcement Provisions.
A. It shall be unlawful, a public nuisance and a misdemeanor for any person to sell or rent an affordable unit at a price or rent exceeding the maximum allowed under this chapter or to a household not qualified under this chapter, and such person shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per month plus restitution of the amount charged that exceeded the maximum allowed under this chapter from the date of original noncompliance until the affordable unit is in compliance with this section. Fine monies collected that exceed the cost of enforcement shall be deposited in the housing fund.
B. The City Attorney or the Marin County District Attorney, as appropriate, shall be authorized to abate violations of this chapter and to enforce the provisions of this chapter and all implementing regulatory agreements and resale controls placed on affordable units by civil action, injunctive relief, and any other proceeding or method permitted by law.
C. The remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall not preclude the City from any other remedy or relief to which it otherwise would be entitled under law or equity. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 1, 2015; Ord. 941 § 1, 2005. Formerly 18.31.050)

18.25.060 Adjustment.
A. A developer of any project subject to the requirements of this chapter may appeal to the City Council for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of the requirements based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or nexus between the impact of the development and either the amount of the fee charged or the inclusionary requirement.
B. A developer subject to the requirements of this chapter who has received an approved tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval and who submits a new or revised tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval for the same property may appeal for a reduction, adjustment or waiver of the requirements with respect to the number of lots or square footage of construction previously approved.
C. Any such appeal shall be made in writing and filed with the City Clerk not later than ten (10) calendar days before the first public hearing on any discretionary approval or permit for the development, or if no such discretionary approval or permit is required, or if the action complained of occurs after the first public hearing on such permit or approval, the appeal shall be filed within ten (10) calendar days after payment of the fees objected to.
D. The appeal shall set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the claim of waiver, reduction, or adjustment. The City Council shall consider the appeal at the public hearing on the permit application or at a separate hearing within sixty (60) calendar days after the filing of the appeal, whichever is later. The appellant shall bear the burden of presenting substantial evidence to support the appeal including comparable technical information to support appellant’s position.
E. No waiver shall be approved by the City Council for a new tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval on property with an approved tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary permit unless the Council finds that the new tentative subdivision or parcel map, use permit or similar discretionary approval is superior to the approved project both in its design and its mitigation of environmental impacts. The decision of the Council shall be final. If a reduction, adjustment, or waiver is granted, any change in the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment, or reduction of the fee or inclusionary requirement. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 1, 2015; Ord. 941 § 1, 2005. Formerly 18.31.060)

To demonstrate the standards and procedures in granting affordable housing density bonuses, concessions, and incentives for housing developments, in an effort to incentivize the construction of affordable units within new developments in the City. This section implements the requirements of Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918, as may be amended from time to time (“State Density Bonus Law”). (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 2, 2015)

Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the definitions found in State Density Bonus Law shall apply to the terms contained herein. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 2, 2015)

18.26.030 Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to all zoning districts that permit housing at a prescribed density by the General Plan land use designation and/or zoning district. Where the density allowed under the zoning district is inconsistent with the density allowed under the General Plan land use designation, the land use designation density shall prevail.

(Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 2, 2015)

18.26.040 State Density Bonus and Affordable Housing Concessions and Incentives.
A developer of a housing development in the City may be permitted a density bonus and incentives in accordance with the provisions of Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918 (State Density Bonus Law) as provided below:
A. Density Bonus. In compliance with Government Code Section 65915 et seq., or successor sections thereto, the City shall provide a density bonus for a qualifying housing development, as defined therein. This section shall apply to all zoning districts within the City that allow residential use. The bonus granted pursuant to this section shall apply only to residential projects or residential components of mixed-use projects, not including units granted as a density bonus. The proposed project shall have all of the following characteristics in order to qualify for a density bonus:
    1. The residential development must include a minimum of five (5) dwelling units.
    2. The applicant seeks and agrees to provide housing units to very low-, low- or moderate-income households or senior citizens consistent with the ratios specified in Government Code Section 65915.
    3. The resulting density is beyond that permitted by the applicable zoning district.
    4. The applicant agrees to retain the affordable status of housing units for at least fifty-five (55) years through the recordation of a deed restriction and through entering a density bonus housing agreement as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.26.060.
    5. If the residential development is replacing existing affordable housing, the replacement fully complies with Government Code Section 65915(c)(3).
B. Concessions and Incentives. Applicants who voluntarily agree to develop a housing development that complies with the affordability requirements referenced in subsection (A) of this section may submit to the City a proposal for the specific incentive(s) or concession(s) described in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.26.050(G) or otherwise provided by applicable state law, including all provisions of the Density Bonus Law, Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918. A proposal shall be submitted concurrently with the application for a density bonus. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 2, 2015)

18.26.050 Application and Review.
A. An application for a state density bonus, incentive, or concession shall be submitted with the first application for approval of a housing development and shall be processed concurrently with all other applications required for the housing development. The application shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the City and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
    1. A site plan showing the total number and location of all proposed housing units and the number and location of proposed housing units which qualify the housing development for density bonus housing units.
    2. The manner in which the applicant shall satisfy the affordability requirements for the housing units which qualify the housing development for density bonus units including:
        a. Evidence that the project meets thresholds set by State Density Bonus Law, excluding the units added by the granted density bonus;
        b. Evidence showing the number of affordable housing units on the property in the five (5) years preceding the date of the application;
        c. Calculations showing the maximum base density;
        d. Number or percentage of affordable units and the income level at which the units will be restricted;
        e. Number of market rate units to result from the granted density bonus;
        f. Resulting density, described in units per square foot; and
        g. A written acknowledgement that the project will be subject to a condition of approval and deed restriction to retain affordability of the affordable unit(s) for at least fifty-five (55) years.
    3. A description of any requested incentives or concessions, waivers or modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards, including:
        a. A description of how the requested incentives or concessions would reduce project costs.
        b. A description of how any development standards requested to be waived or modified would physically preclude the construction of the proposed housing.
    4. For all incentives or concessions, except mixed use development, the application shall include information deemed sufficient by the City that the requested incentives or concessions result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.
        a. For waivers or modifications of development standards, the application shall include evidence deemed sufficient by the City that the development standard from which a waiver or modification is requested will have the effect of precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to this chapter and with the concessions and incentives permitted by this chapter.
        b. Information required by this subsection may include a financial analysis or other report demonstrating that the requested incentives or concessions result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions necessary to ensure the financial feasibility of the proposed units.
        c. The information required by subsection (A)(4)(b) of this section shall be provided directly to an independent analyst hired by the City. The analyst shall prepare a written report for the City that evaluates whether the requested incentives or concessions would result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions necessary to ensure the financial feasibility of the proposed units. The applicant shall be responsible for all consulting costs for document preparation and review.
    5. If a density bonus is requested for a land donation, the application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide evidence that each of the conditions pursuant to Government Code Section 65915(g)(2)(A) through (H) are met.
    6. If a density bonus or incentive or concession is requested for a child care facility pursuant to Government Code Section 65915(h), the application shall show the location and square footage of the child care facility and provide evidence that the community lacks adequate child care facilities.
B. Review and Consideration. An application for a density bonus, incentive or concession, waiver or modification of a development standard, or revised parking standard, shall be considered and acted upon by the City body with review authority for the housing development. Complete applications for a residential development project, which include all required submittal documents and which include the construction of affordable units, shall be processed by all City departments before other residential land use applications regardless of the original submittal date. Complete applications which include all required submittal documents and which include affordable rental units shall be processed before applications including owner-occupied units.
C. Approval. Before approving an application for a density bonus, incentive or concession, or waiver or modification of a development standard, the approval body shall make the following findings:
    1. If the density bonus is based all or in part on a donation of land, the conditions of Government Code Section 65915(g)(2)(A) through (H) are met.
    2. If the density bonus, incentive or concession is based all or in part on the inclusion of a child care facility, that the conditions included in Government Code Section 65915(h)(2)(A) and (B) are met.
    3. If the incentive or concession includes mixed use development, the findings included in Government Code Section 65915(k)(2) are met.
    4. If a waiver or modification of a development standard is requested, the developer has demonstrated, for each requested waiver or modification, that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible and that the development standards from which a waiver or modification is requested will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development at the densities to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to this chapter or with the concessions and incentives permitted by this chapter.
    5. If affordable housing existed on the site in the five (5) years preceding the application, that the application meets all of the requirements of Government Code Section 65915(c)(3).
D. The approval body may deny a concession or incentive if it makes a written finding based upon substantial evidence of either of the following:
    1. The concession or incentive is not required to provide for affordable rents or affordable housing costs as required by this chapter.
    2. The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact upon public health or safety or the physical environment or on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to lower-, very low- or moderate-income households. For purposes of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete.
    3. The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law.
E. The approval body may deny a waiver or modification of a development standard only if it makes a written finding based upon substantial evidence of either of the following:
    1. The waiver or modification would have a specific adverse impact upon health, safety or the physical environment and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the housing development unaffordable to lower-, very low- or moderate-income households. For purposes of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete.
    2. The waiver or modification would have an adverse impact on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.
    3. The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law.
F. If a density bonus or concession or incentive is based on the provision of child care facilities, the approval body may deny the density bonus or concession or incentive if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that the City already has adequate child care facilities.
G. For projects which meet or exceed the inclusionary requirements as specified in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.25.040(A), the City Council may consider, on a case-by-case basis, at its sole discretion, the provision of the following additional concessions or incentives, where consistent with the Housing Element of the City of Larkspur General Plan:
    1. Waiver or modification of City standards thereby directly reducing project costs while remaining consistent with the latest edition of the California Building Code. The developer shall be responsible for documenting that the waiver or modification is necessary for the feasibility of the residential development project and is consistent with all applicable provisions of the California Building Code.
    2. Provision of direct financial assistance in the form of a loan or grant using trust fund or other appropriate available funds subject to the recommendation of the City Manager.
    3. Deferral of payment of all City-required fees on market rate units, but payment shall be made prior to, and as a condition of, release of utilities and issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
The concessions and incentives described in this section are in addition to any incentives or concessions to which a project may be entitled pursuant to this chapter, the State Density Bonus Law, or other provision of law. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 999 § 2, 2015)

18.26.060 Density Bonus Housing Agreement.
A. Density Bonus Housing Agreement. An applicant requesting a density bonus shall agree to enter into an affordable housing agreement (“agreement”) with the City in the City’s standard form of agreement. Execution of the agreement shall be made a condition of approval for any discretionary planning permit for housing developments pursuant to this chapter and shall be recorded as a restriction on any parcels on which the housing units which qualify the housing development for a density bonus will be constructed.
B. Recording of Agreement. The agreement shall be recorded prior to the final or parcel map approval, or, where the housing development does not include a map, prior to the issuance of a building permit.
C. Contents of the Agreement. Each agreement shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
    1. A description of the residential development, including whether the housing units which qualify the housing development for a density bonus will be rented or owner-occupied;
    2. The number, size and location of the housing units which qualify the housing development for a density bonus;
    3. Provisions and/or documents for resale restrictions, deeds of trust, right of first refusal or rental restrictions;
    4. Provisions for monitoring the ongoing affordability of the housing units which qualify the housing development for a density bonus, and the process for qualifying prospective resident households for income eligibility; and
    5. Any additional obligations relevant to the compliance with this chapter.
D. Owner-Occupied Agreements. The purchaser of each owner-occupied housing unit which qualified the housing development for a density bonus shall execute the City’s standard form agreement, to be recorded against the parcel, and which includes such provisions as the City may require to ensure continued compliance with this chapter.
E. Agreements for Child Care Facilities and Land Donations. Density bonus housing agreements for child care facilities and land dedications shall ensure continued compliance with all conditions included in Government Code Sections 65915(h)(2)(A) and (B) and 65915(g)(2)(A) through (H), respectively.

18.34.010 Purpose.
The City is situated among a group of major and minor hills and ridges. These constitute a significant natural topographical feature of the community because they are visible to all persons traveling the major arteries leading north through the county, as well as to citizens residing in and around the community.
The migration of substantial numbers of persons to this area, and the attendant technological amenities required to serve that population have not, as yet, detrimentally impinged upon all of the hills. However, in order to ensure the preservation of most of the hills, ridges and ridgelines, and their natural features, a more harmonious visual and functional relationship is required between the existing natural environment and the growing manmade environment.
Therefore, it is the intent of the City to place land, in hillside areas of a slope of ten (10) percent or greater, under more restrictive regulations than those normally required for flat land development (also refer to residential floor ratios in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.35.040) in order to accomplish one or more of the following:
A. To preserve significant features of a sloping and elevated hill area in essentially their natural state.
B. To encourage in hill areas an alternative approach to conventional flat land practices of development.
C. To minimize grading and cut and fill operations consistent with the retention of the natural character of the hill areas.
D. To minimize the water runoff and soil erosion problems incurred in adjustment of the terrain in order to meet on-site and off-site development needs.
E. To achieve, in hill areas, land use densities and lot sizes for the creation of new parcels through subdivisions, lot line adjustments, and multiple-unit residential developments that are in keeping with the General Plan and retain the significant natural features of the hill areas. (Note: The land use densities and lot size regulations of this chapter are not intended to apply to new single-family homes built on existing legally created parcels or to the merger of existing legally created substandard size parcels, both of which are subject to other provisions of the zoning ordinance and Larkspur Municipal Code.)
F. To ensure that hillside land characterized by soil and other subsurface conditions having unstable characteristics be identified and that this factor be taken into account before the issuance of any permits required by this chapter.
G. To ensure that the City does not incur any inordinate increase in the cost of providing or maintaining public services and that any increase in the cost of supplying or maintaining public services would not significantly weaken the City’s financial position.
H. To preserve the predominant views both from and of the hill areas and to retain the sense of identity and image that these hill areas now impart to the City and its environs. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.020 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases are defined as follows:
“Contour interval” means the difference in elevation between adjacent contour lines on a topographical or planimetric map.
“Hillside land” means land which has an average percent of slope equal to or exceeding ten (10) percent.
Natural State. For the purpose of determining compliance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.34.080, Preservation of Natural and Permeable Areas, “natural state” is that portion of a lot that is open and undeveloped with structures and other impermeable surfaces. Impermeable surfaces include, but are not limited to, the footprint of structures, paved walkways and driveways, swimming pools, decks, patios and walls, but shall not include permeable materials such as turf block, crushed granite, or other materials approved as permeable by the Public Works Department. Vehicular easements serving other properties shall be excluded from the natural state calculation.
“Ridge” means a connected series of major and minor hills as designated on the zoning map of the City.
“Ridgeline” means a ground line located at the highest elevation of the ridge running parallel to the long axis of the ridge. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(38), 2007; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 929 § 24, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.030 Average Percent of Slope.
A. The average percent of slope is calculated using the following formula:
S = (100 × I × L) ÷ A
where “S” is the average percent of slope; “I” is the contour interval in feet; “L” is the summation of length of the contour lines in feet less the length of the average contour line; i.e., L = total length of contour lines – total length of contour lines divided by total number of contour lines; and “A” is the area of the lot being considered in square feet.
B. Slope calculations shall be based on accurate topographic survey maps of the following minimum standards:
    1. For parcels under one acre in size, the map scale shall not be less than one inch equals eight (8) feet (one-eighth scale).
    2. For parcels of one acre up to ten (10) acres, the map scale shall not be less than one inch equals thirty (30) feet.
    3. For parcels ten (10) acres or larger in size, not less than one inch equals forty (40) feet.
    4. Maps of any scale shall use a five-foot contour interval or less.
C. For the purpose of determining required natural state, density adjustments, and FAR ratios, the calculated slope shall be rounded off to the nearest one percent.
D. The calculation of slope shall exclude vehicular easements, which are not applicable to required natural state, density adjustment, and FAR ratios. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 929 §§ 25, 26, 27, 2004; Ord. 689 § 2, 1983; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.035 Exclusions of Areas from Slope Calculations, as Applied to Subdivisions, Lot Line Adjustments, and Multiple-Unit Residential Development.
A. For the purposes of determining the minimum lot area per dwelling and the allowed density, the owner may elect to exclude portions of the site from that considered in the calculations of average slope. No more than three (3) such portions of a site may be excluded from these calculations. Each area so excluded must be delineated using five (5) or fewer straight lines and may in addition include the property lines.
B. If the owner makes this election the following requirements apply:
    1. The land excluded from calculation must remain undeveloped and a deed restriction assuring this provision, in a form acceptable to the City, must be recorded.
    2. Only twenty (20) percent of the density which would be allowed for the area excluded, given its slope and size, may be added to that of the remainder of the property to determine the overall density or satisfy the minimum lot area per unit requirement.
    3. The portions of the site excluded from slope calculations shall not be considered when calculating the natural state of the site.
C. This provision does not apply to the calculations of average slope for the purposes of determining if a use permit is required. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 929 § 28, 2004; Ord. 689 § 3, 1983)

18.34.040 Application of Regulations.
This chapter applies to all hillside land as defined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.34.020. In the event of conflicts between this chapter and the land use regulations that apply by virtue of the zoning classification, this chapter and the regulations hereunder shall apply. However, in a P-D District, the standards of this chapter shall apply, subject to the exceptions allowed by the Planning Commission and City Council as provided for in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.55.020 of the P-D District regulations. For slope use permits, the public hearing procedures of Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.76 shall apply, except where specified herein. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 929 § 29, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.050 Minimum Lot Area per Dwelling Unit.
Except as provided under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.34.070 pertaining to density adjustment, the minimum lot area on hillside land required per dwelling unit for a subdivision, lot line adjustment, or multiple-unit residential development shall be determined in accordance with the graph referenced in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.34.110. (Note: The land use densities and lot size regulations of this chapter are not intended to apply to new single-family homes built on existing legally created parcels or to the merger of existing legally created substandard size parcels, both of which are subject to other provisions of the zoning ordinance and Larkspur Municipal Code.) (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.060 Slope Use Permit.
A. Slope Use Permit Requirement. A slope use permit shall be required whenever:
    1. A structure is proposed within one hundred (100) vertical feet of a ridgeline.
    2. The average slope of the parcel exceeds twenty-five (25) percent and the amount of earth to be cut and/or filled is twenty-five (25) cubic yards or more, excluding material used solely for the purposes of filling a pool from the calculation of total fill.
    3. The average slope of the parcel is twenty-five (25) percent or less and the amount of earth to be cut and/or filled is one hundred fifty (150) cubic yards or more, excluding material used solely for the purposes of filling a pool from the calculation of total fill.
B. In considering the slope use permit application, the Planning Commission shall consider the following matters before approving the issuance of a slope use permit:

A slope use permit shall expire two (2) years after the effective date of the Planning Commission’s action, or final discretionary approval, or at an alternative period specified by the approving body at the time of final discretionary approval. The applicant may apply to the Planning Director for a one-year extension of the permit prior to its expiration date, and the Director shall grant the extension if he or she determines that no significant changes to information regarding the condition of the property and/or the surrounding district have occurred since the original approval. An additional one-year extension shall require an application to the Planning Commission, and shall be considered at a duly noticed public hearing. The applicant shall pay a fee for the extension hearing in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of processing, and the same criteria used by the Planning Director for granting the extension shall apply. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(39, 40), 2007; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 929 §§ 30 – 34, 2004; Ord. 554 § 1, 1976; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.070 Density Adjustments for Subdivisions, Lot Line Adjustments, and Multiple-Unit Residential Developments.
The effectiveness of hillside development can be affected by a number of factors such as the physical characteristics of a specific parcel, the amount of landscaped and natural open areas existing within a development, the existence of amenities within a development and the number of people who will reside in the hill area. Therefore, in order to encourage developers of hillside developments to take into consideration the above factors, the Planning Commission may approve adjustments in the density, not to exceed the density allowed by applicable zoning districts and the General Plan when any of the following factors are provided:
A. The existence of natural areas beyond that required pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.34.080.
B. The existence of amenities or on-site or off-site improvements which are not normally found or required in residential developments.
C. The existence of a mixture of housing types which provides a variation in the appearance of the development and allows a range of housing prices for differing income levels.
D. The offer to and acceptance by the City of land in excess of the park land dedication requirements of Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 17.13.
E. The incorporation of the concept of clustering of development. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.080 Preservation of Natural and Permeable Areas.
The percentage of each parcel that must remain in its natural state, or otherwise be permeable, shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent plus the percentage figure of average slope as calculated in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.34.030, not to exceed a maximum of ninety (90) percent. Example: A parcel with an average slope of twenty (20) percent would require in natural state twenty-five (25) percent plus the slope percentage figure (twenty (20) percent) for a total natural state requirement of forty-five (45) percent. In addition, no development shall exceed the maximum building coverage allowed in the applicable Residential Zoning District except in clustering where the total area of the project shall be used in calculating coverage. In a legal nonconforming lot, the natural state requirement shall not exceed seventy (70) percent. Additions constructed pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.35.030(C) may exceed the minimum natural state requirement. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(41), 2007; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.090 Grading Control.
A. Size and Treatment. In order to keep all graded areas and cuts and fills to a minimum, to eliminate unsightly grading and to preserve the natural appearance and beauty of the property as far as possible as well as to serve the other specified purposes of this chapter, specific requirements may be placed on the size of areas to be graded or to be used for building, and on the size, height and angles of cut slopes and fill slopes and the shape thereof. In appropriate cases, retaining walls or other means of ensuring soil stability may be required.
B. Restrictions. All areas indicated as natural areas on the approved development plan shall be undisturbed by grading or excavating for structures or otherwise, except that riding trails, hiking trails, picnic areas, stables and similar amenities may be placed in natural open areas pursuant to the approval of a use permit.
C. Landscaping. Plans shall include the planting of newly created banks or slopes for erosion control and/or to eliminate or minimize undesirable visual effects.
D. Cumulative Grading. When considering the amount of grading proposed by a current development proposal, the existence of prior grading on a site shall be taken into account, especially as it relates to the required finding that the amount of proposed grading is limited to what is necessary to allow reasonable development of the site. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(42), 2007; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.100 Building Height and Setback Requirements.
The building height, front, side and rear setback requirements, not specifically set forth in this chapter or by use permit issued hereunder, are those required by the applicable zoning district. However, setback requirements may be waived through the slope use permit process if the Planning Commission finds that the site’s unique character is best preserved by the reduction of required setbacks, as long as these reductions do not conflict with fire and building codes. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(43), 2007; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.34.110 Lot Area per Unit Based on Average Slope for Subdivisions, Lot Line Adjustments, and Multiple-Unit Residential Developments.
For provisions relating to lot area per unit based on average slope for subdivisions, lot line adjustments, and multiple-unit residential developments, see graph on file in the Planning Department. (Note: The land use densities and lot size regulations of this chapter are not intended to apply to new single-family homes built on existing legally created parcels or to the merger of existing legally created substandard size parcels, both of which are subject to other provisions of the zoning ordinance and Larkspur Municipal Code.) (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 934 § 2, 2004; Ord. 471 § 1 (part), 1973)

Chapter 18.35 RESIDENTIAL FLOOR AREA RATIOS

Sections:
18.35.010    Purpose.
18.35.020    Application.
18.35.030    Existing Enclosed Structures – Exemption.
18.35.040    Standards.
18.35.050    Maximum and Minimum Floor Areas.
18.35.060    Exception Permit.

18.35.010 Purpose.
This chapter shall establish standards to control the bulk of structures in Residential Zoning Districts to ensure that the scale of new construction is consistent with the established neighborhood patterns and the individual site to minimize environmental impacts and to avoid overbuilding on substandard-sized lots. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 931 § 1, 2004)

18.35.020 Application.
This chapter applies to all properties in the First, Second and Third Residential Zoning Districts (R-1, R-2, R-3) and to the construction of new structures, main buildings and accessory structures; and the construction of additions to existing structures, main buildings, and accessory structures in these districts. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 931 § 1, 2004)

18.35.030 Existing Enclosed Structures – Exemption.
A. The regulations of this chapter shall not be interpreted as rendering existing structures nonconforming.
B. Existing enclosed structures that do not conform to the standards of this chapter may be altered or reconstructed, provided:
    1. That the alterations or reconstruction shall not increase the gross floor area of the structure to an amount greater than was contained in the original structure; and
    2. Said work otherwise meets the provisions of the Larkspur Municipal Code.
C. Each of the following structures is excluded from the calculation to determine the maximum floor area, if they meet all other provisions of the Larkspur Municipal Code and no discretionary land use permits are required:
    1. A one-time-only ground-level single-story (not extending more than fifteen (15) feet above grade) building addition of two hundred (200) square feet or less in area to an existing residence, if no other additions, which added floor area, have been approved since October 20, 1982, and if not otherwise conditioned as part of an original discretionary approval (i.e., a condition of approval specifying that this exemption is not available for future additions to the structure).
    2. An accessory building of less than ninety-six (96) square feet, and with a building height of no more than nine (9) feet above grade, provided no other accessory buildings, except a garage or carport that provides required parking, exist on the site.
Any floor area added to a home under the conditions outlined in subsections (C)(1) and (2) of this section shall count towards the floor area ratio for any subsequent application on the property receiving the exemption. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(44), 2007; Ord. 931 § 1, 2004)

18.35.040 Standards.
A. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) standards for lots in the First, Second and Third Residential Districts are as listed in the second column of Table 35-1.
+----------+----------+-------------+
| District | Base FAR | Minimum FAR |
+----------+----------+-------------+
| R-1      | .40      | .05         |
+----------+----------+-------------+
| R-2      | .50      | .15         |
+----------+----------+-------------+
| R-3      | .60      | .055        |
+----------+----------+-------------+
B. Lots with Slopes of Ten (10) Percent or Greater. 
    1. For lots in the First and Second Residential Districts, for every one percent increase in average slope above ten (10) percent, the FAR decreases by one one-hundredth until forty-five (45) percent of slope is reached, after which there are no further decreases in the FAR regardless of the increase in the average slope. The minimum FAR is listed in the third column of Table 35-1.
    2. For sloping lots in the Third Residential District, the floor area ratio shall be as set forth in Table 35-2.
    3. Calculation of Slope. 
        a. For the purposes of this chapter, the slope of a property shall be calculated following the procedures of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.34.030.
        b. Where a residence is to be constructed or improved on a portion of a parcel that has a lower average slope than the entire parcel, for the purpose of calculating the maximum floor area, a property owner may elect to split the parcel into two (2) portions and then calculate the slope, floor area ratio, and maximum floor area for each portion. The sum of the two (2) calculated floor areas would be the maximum floor area entitlement for such residence. The split portions must be divided by no more than three (3) connected straight lines and the entirety of all existing and proposed floor area must be located within the portion containing the lesser slope.

18.35.050 Maximum and Minimum Floor Areas.
A. The maximum gross floor area of all enclosed structures on a lot shall not exceed the floor area ratio, as set in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.35.040, times the area of the lot, except as provided for in subsection (B) of this section, or as allowed by an exception permit, as is provided for in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.35.060.
B. In no case shall the application of this chapter reduce the gross floor area of a dwelling to less than minimum “living area required,” as prescribed in each Residential Zoning District’s regulations, plus a garage of four hundred (400) square feet for each single-family or duplex unit, and the minimum area required to provide covered parking for every multiple-family residential project. The additional gross floor area of the garages may not be transferred to the floor area of other structures. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 931 § 1, 2004)

18.35.060 Exception Permit.
A. Subject to the following procedures, the Planning Commission may grant an exception permit to allow floor areas greater than provided for above; however, the Zoning Administrator may grant an exception permit for ground-level single-story (not extending more than fifteen (15) feet above grade) additions of less than five hundred and one (501) square feet to existing residences.
B. Application may be filed with the City by a property owner or his authorized representative for an exception to the FAR requirements. The application will be made to the Planning Department and be subject to fees as established by a resolution of the City Council.
C. Required Information. The applicant shall provide three (3) or more copies of the following information (additional copies will be required at the time of hearing):
    1. The information required for a design review permit, set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.64.040.
    2. The site plans shall show all the structures on contiguous lots (which include lots across any abutting streets).
    3. Elevation drawings showing the outlines of these adjacent structures and the structure in question drawn to the same scale.

    5. The Planning Director may waive any of the information submittal requirements.
D. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing that has been noticed pursuant to the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.76.030. At this hearing the Commission shall consider the testimony of the applicant and any interested parties and then, based on the following findings, either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.
E. Required Findings. The Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator may only grant an exception to the FAR standards if the findings outlined in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.64.055 and the following findings can be made:
    1. The applicant has employed mass-reducing techniques such that the additional square footage over the floor area limit for the site is mitigated and does not result in a home that overbuilds the lot. The technique or culmination of techniques results in a design that either blends with the neighborhood or is of a unique architectural design that is sensitive to the immediate neighbors and compatible with the overall neighborhood character.
    2. The proposed structure will not contribute significantly to adverse traffic or parking conditions in the neighborhood.
F. Appeal and Appeal Period. The decision of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 2.50. The Commission’s action will not be final until the appeal period has lapsed.
G. Revocation. The Planning Commission may hold a public hearing, noticed as required above, and revoke the exception permit if it finds that the conditions of the original approval have not been complied with.
H. Expiration. An exception permit shall expire two (2) years after the effective date of the Planning Commission’s action, or final discretionary approval, or at an alternative period specified by the approving body at the time of final discretionary approval. The applicant may apply to the Planning Director for a one-year extension of the permit prior to its expiration date, and the Director shall grant the extension if he or she determines that no significant changes to information regarding the condition of the property and/or the surrounding district have occurred since the original approval. An additional one-year extension shall require an application to the Planning Commission, and shall be considered at a duly noticed public hearing. The applicant shall pay a fee for the extension hearing in an amount to cover the costs of processing, and the same criteria used by the Planning Director for granting the extension shall apply.

18.36.035 Condominiums.
The development of condominiums must follow the standards and regulations of Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.38. Further, the conversion of existing residential real property to a condominium project, community apartment project, or stock cooperative requires the approval of a use permit under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.38.070 et seq.

18.36.050 Unit Density and Minimum Lot Area.
A. The ordinance adopting any RMP District may specify the maximum density or density range. The allowable density is established by appending a numerical designation to the RMP District.
B. A range of densities shall be interpreted in the following manner: The base density shall be the low figure of the range; the high density figure shall represent the maximum density which may be granted by the Planning Commission upon their consideration of the applicant’s provision of additional facilities which further the goals and objectives of the Larkspur General Plan. Such facilities may include the provision of moderate and median income housing. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 528 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.36.060 Standards and Requirements.
Standards for lot area frontage and width, coverage, yards, building heights, and parking for uses in the RMP District shall be the standard of the zoning district governing uses most similar in nature and function to uses proposed in the RMP District. Exceptions to these standards may be allowed by the Planning Commission and the City Council, when it can be found that such exceptions would result in a more desirable development and are warranted in terms of the relationship of the total proposed development or units thereof with the General Plan. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 528 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.36.070 Establishment of an RMP District.
A. General Provisions. 
    1. The RMP District may be established by a City-initiated zoning process or by application to the Planning Commission by one or more private property owners.
    2. The minimum area on which an RMP District may be established shall be two (2) acres of contiguous land. However, an RMP District may be established for an area of less than two (2) contiguous acres if the Planning Commission and the City Council find that the property’s unique characteristics warrant its designation as an RMP District.
    3. If a property owner or owners initiate the zoning process, the RMP zoning classification shall be established at the time of adoption of the preliminary master plan, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. At the time of adoption of the preliminary master plan, the land shall be classified RMP with a number appended thereto designating the allowable number of units per acre, i.e., a density classification.
    4. If the City initiates the zoning process, the RMP zoning classification shall be established by ordinance prior to the approval of the preliminary master plan; however, the interim use of the property shall be as indicated in subsection (B) of this section. At the time of adoption of the ordinance, the City may append to the RMP classification a number or a range of numbers designating the allowable number of units per acre.
B. City-Initiated Process. 
    1. Procedures for establishing an RMP zoning classification for any parcel or parcels of property within the City may be initiated by the Planning Commission or the City Council in accordance with the procedures set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.80.
    2. Following the establishment of an RMP District, the permitted uses in the district shall be single-family detached residential structures and accessory uses with a minimum density classification of one-tenth unit per acre or the density classification established by the City at the time of adoption of the RMP zoning classification. Such interim permitted uses shall be in effect until and unless a preliminary master plan is processed and approved by the City pursuant to the procedures set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.36.080. While the interim uses are in effect, no improvement, land or road grading shall be done unless in compliance with the regulations governing the R-1 District as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.20.
C. Application Procedures by Private Property Owners. An application for the establishment of an RMP District may be made to the Planning Commission by one or more private property owners. The application shall be submitted on prescribed forms and shall be accompanied by a filing fee. In addition, the applicant shall pay the actual costs of services rendered in checking the preliminary residential master plan for conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The preliminary residential master plan shall not be processed until such fees are paid. The application shall be signed by the owner(s) of every parcel within the boundaries of the proposed RMP District. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 528 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.36.080 Projects Requiring Residential Master Plan Approval.
A. All projects proposed within an RMP District which have a density exceeding one-tenth unit per acre must obtain approval of a preliminary and precise residential master plan pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. However, any legal parcel less than ten (10) acres in size upon which only one dwelling unit is proposed does not require the approval of a preliminary and precise residential master plan.
B. Any land division in the RMP Zoning District which creates two (2) or more new parcels, any one of which contains less than ten (10) acres, must obtain approval of a preliminary and precise residential master plan pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, prior to the approval of a land division map or a subdivision map by the City.
C. The development of only one dwelling unit on any legal parcel less than ten (10) acres in size shall require the approval of a single residence master plan by the Planning Commission. No Design Review Board review of a single residence master plan is required in this single step process. The single residence master plan design shall be in substantial conformance with the submittal requirements listed in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.36.090 and 18.36.140 to the satisfaction of the Planning Director. The Planning Commission shall base their approval, conditional approval, or denial of the single residence master plan on the following findings:
    1. The single residence master plan design is in substantial conformance with the intent and purpose of the RMP zoning designation.
    2. The project is consistent with the Larkspur General Plan, including land use and density designations.
    3. The applicant has demonstrated that the proposed structure, site improvements, and site design respect the physical characteristics of the site. These characteristics include, but are not limited to the scale of principal trees, rock outcroppings, wetland areas, land forms, the dimensions of the lot, water quality, fish and wildlife habitats, wildlife movement corridors, streams, creeks and associated riparian vegetation, native trees and biodiversity.
    4. The proposed site design will not significantly contribute to adverse environmental impacts in the neighborhood. These impacts include, but are not limited to, traffic circulation, community health and safety, environmental resources, and community facilities and services.
    5. The proposed structure will not be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare, comfort, or convenience of persons working or residing in the neighborhood of the proposed structure; nor be detrimental to the general welfare. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 835 § 1, 1992; Ord. 544 § 1, 1976; Ord. 528 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.36.090 Preliminary Residential Master Plan.

Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to accomplish the following:
A. Assure adequate maintenance of condominiums, as their fragmented ownership may result in conditions of disrepair that are inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare.
B. Assure that condominium projects are capable of satisfying the more demanding physical needs of long-term owners in contract to the lesser expectations of short-term rental occupants.
C. Maintain the availability of an adequate supply of multifamily rental housing. In a period of extreme scarcity of multifamily rental units, conversion of such units to condominiums would work a hardship on tenants who are unable to purchase the units they occupy and are unable to find equivalent replacement housing in the Lower Ross Valley.
D. Provide for maintenance of rental units within projects that are converted, especially for the handicapped and elderly. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 667 § 1 (part), 1981)

    3. Screening of buyers or renters to assure conformance with the income limitations shall be handled by the Marin Ecumenical Association for Housing, the Marin Housing Authority or other agency acceptable to the City of Larkspur.
C. Retention of Rental Units. Forty (40) percent of the units in the condominium shall be retained in perpetuity as rental apartments. The project CC&Rs shall be revised to provide assurance to this end and also for the maintenance and management of the rental units. The provision of units at low income rents will satisfy the requirement in subsection (B) of this section to the extent the number of units so rented at low income limits meet or exceed the number of units required in subsection (B) of this section.
D. Elderly and Handicapped Tenants. 
    1. Householders residing in the project at the time the final map is filed shall be provided with rental leases to their units as defined below:
        a. The annual rent increases for such units shall be limited to fifty (50) percent of the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index in California for urban wage earners and clerical workers for the San Francisco Bay Area.
        b. The annual increase in rents shall be based on that rent paid by the tenant three (3) months prior to the approval of this use permit plus the referenced increases that will have occurred until the date of the filing of the final subdivision map.

E. Prohibiting Discrimination. The project CC&Rs shall contain a provision that prohibits discrimination against families with minor children in either rental or sale of units. This condition may be deleted by the Commission where its application would not be warranted because of the type of project (e.g., senior housing) or because of the physical construction of the project.
F. The developer must to the fullest extent possible make physical modifications to ten (10) percent of the project units to meet the special needs of the elderly and the mobility of handicapped. The commission shall review the changes or proposed changes to the project at the time of the tentative subdivision map to ensure substantial compliance with this condition.
G. If temporary relocation of any tenant is necessary for renovation of a unit between the date of submission of the use permit application and the date established for permanent relocation by subsection (D) of this section, then the applicant shall find equivalent substitute housing for that tenant for the period of renovation, and shall pay to that tenant any additional rent of the substitute housing and any moving expenses.
H. For permanent relocation each tenant not remaining in the project shall be allowed possession for ninety (90) days past the date of recordation of the final map or parcel map, or until the expiration of that tenant’s lease, whichever is longer.

I. A sinking fund shall be established in an amount satisfactory to the City Engineer for the maintenance and repair of all commonly owned structures, mechanical equipment, open space, common guest parking and landscaped areas.
J. The applicant must apply for a tentative subdivision map within one year from the approval of this use permit or the permit is null and void unless it is extended for no more than one additional year by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 667 § 1 (part), 1981)

When a lower ranked alternative is proposed, the application must include technical information demonstrating that a higher ranked option is not technically feasible in light of the provider’s service objectives.
    1. Most Preferred Locations. 
        a. City-owned parcels in any zoning district, excepting parks and properties located in the H (Historic) Overlay Zone and residential zoning districts (R-1, R-2, R-3, RMP);
        b. Any parcel or public right-of-way located in the industrial zoning district;
        c. Any parcel or public right-of-way located in a commercial zoning district (C-1, C-2, AP);
        d. Any parcel or public right-of-way located in a PD Zoning District developed with commercial and office uses; and
        e. Any parcel or public right-of-way located in TD Zoning District;
    2. Least Preferred Locations. 
        a. Any parcel or public right-of-way located in an open space district;
        b. Any parcel or public right-of-way located in residential zoning districts (R-1, R-2, R-3, RMP);
        c. Any public park;
        d. Any parcel or public right-of-way within a PD Zoning District developed for residential use;

B. Spacing and Co-Location. 
    1. New communication facilities shall be co-located with existing facilities and with other planned new facilities whenever feasible and aesthetically desirable. In addition, where feasible and aesthetically desirable, service providers are encouraged to co-locate with other facilities such as existing buildings, water tanks, light standards, and other utility structures where the co-location is found to minimize the overall visual impact. Service providers shall exhaust all reasonable measures to co-locate their communications facilities on existing towers or with or within existing ancillary support equipment facilities prior to applying for new communication facility sites. The service provider shall provide evidence that the provider has contacted all other potential providers who have, or who are reasonably likely to be installing, facilities within the vicinity of the proposed facility and has offered to participate in a joint installation project on reasonable terms. In order to facilitate co-location, conditions of approval for conditional use permits for new facilities shall require all service providers to cooperate in the siting of equipment and antennas to accommodate the maximum number of operators at a given site where found to be feasible and aesthetically desirable.
    2. No new freestanding antenna structure, including towers, lattice towers, and monopoles, shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of another freestanding facility unless mounting on a building or co-location on an existing pole or tower is not feasible and techniques have been used to camouflage, screen, or otherwise minimize the visual impact of the facility to the extent feasible.
C. Height. 
    1. All ground-mounted wireless communication equipment shall be of a minimum functional height.
    2. The height of a tower or monopole located on the ground shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet.
    3. Subject to approval of a conditional use permit, a tower or monopole, may exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height, but shall not exceed fifty (50) feet when located adjacent to residentially zoned properties or a residential development in a PD Zoning District, and shall not be readily visible to an adjacent residentially zoned property.
    4. The height of a communications facility located on a building shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet above the maximum height limit for that district.
    5. Antennas mounted on the side of a building shall not extend above the roof line or building parapet.

E. Screening. 
    1. All ground-mounted equipment, antennas, poles, towers or monopoles shall be sited to be screened by existing development, topography, or vegetation, to the extent feasible. Ground-mounted facilities are encouraged to be located within buildings, underground, in fenced enclosures, and placed in areas where substantial screening by existing buildings or vegetation can be achieved. Additional new vegetation or other screening may be required by the Zoning Administrator or by the Planning Commission if a conditional use permit is required. The applicant shall use the smallest and least visible antennas possible to accomplish the owner/operator’s coverage objectives.
    2. All associated wiring and power cables for a communications facility shall be concealed within stealth enclosures along with associated antennas, within the tower or monopole, or within cable covers to blend with the existing natural or built surroundings and existing supporting structures. Wiring and cable runs shall not be installed on the exterior of a building wall that is visible from a public right-of-way or parking lot.
F. Siting. 
    1. Communication facilities located on the roof of a building shall be set back from the nearest roof edge the equivalent of the height of the tower or a minimum of ten (10) feet, whichever is greater.
    2. Towers, monopoles and antennas shall be set back, and not readily visible, from a residentially zoned property or residential development within a PD Zoning District at a ratio of two (2) horizontal feet for every one foot in height.
    3. Towers, monopoles and antennas shall be set back from any site boundary or public right-of-way by a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. No part of any tower or antenna shall extend into any required front or street side yard or beyond the property lines of the development site.
    4. In order of preference, ancillary support equipment for a communication facility shall be located either within a building, underground, in a rear yard or on a screened rooftop area. Ground-mounted facilities that are located within the front or side yard or public right-of-way shall be undergrounded, unless the applicant demonstrates that undergrounding is not technologically feasible, and located so as to be screened by landscaping, in close proximity to existing above-ground utilities (such as electrical towers or utility poles), light poles, trees of comparable height, water tanks, and other areas where the ground-mounted facility will be designed and screened to blend with the existing natural or built surroundings .
G. Power Lines. All power lines to and within a communications site shall be underground where possible, as determined by the Director of Public Works.
H. Backup Power Supplies. All backup power supplies (e.g., generators) located in an industrial zoning district shall be enclosed within an equipment enclosure and operated in accordance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.51.070(G). Backup power supplies for communication facilities located in commercial or residential zoning districts shall require the approval of a conditional use permit by the Planning Commission. In any zoning district, ancillary fuel storage tank(s) to support backup power supplies shall require approval of a conditional use permit by the Planning Commission.

B. Certification must be provided that the proposed facility will at all times comply with all applicable health requirements and standards pertaining to electromagnetic and/or radio frequency radiation.
C. Interference with City communication systems or communication systems for emergency services, such as hospitals, is prohibited. All proposed facility applications shall include reports, as required by the Police and Fire Departments, to evaluate for potential interference (e.g., HF, UHF, VHF, eight hundred (800) MHz). The applicant shall be responsible for any costs incurred by the City, including the costs of retaining consultants, to review and analyze the reports.
D. All wireless communication facilities and related equipment, including lighting, fences, shields, cabinets, and poles, shall be maintained in good repair, free from trash, debris, litter and graffiti and other forms of vandalism, and any damage from any cause shall be repaired as soon as reasonably possible so as to minimize occurrences of dangerous conditions or visual blight. Graffiti shall be removed from any facility or equipment as soon as practicable, and in no instances more than forty-eight (48) hours from the time of written notification by mail or facsimile from the City. If the graffiti is not removed within forty-eight (48) hours of written notification, the City may elect to complete the removal at the property owner’s expense.
E. Each wireless communication facility which contains trees, foliage or other landscaping elements, whether or not used as screening, shall be maintained in good condition at all times in accordance with the approved landscape plan, and the owner or operator of the facility shall be responsible for replacing any damaged, dead or decayed landscaping as promptly as reasonably possible. Amendments or modifications to the landscape plan shall be submitted for approval to the Zoning Administrator.
F. Each wireless communication facility shall be operated in such a manner so as to comply with Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 9.54, Noise Control Regulations, and shall minimize any possible disruption caused by noise. Backup generators shall only be operated during periods of power outages, and shall not be tested on weekends or holidays, or between the hours of ten p.m. and seven a.m. on weekday nights.
G. Each owner or operator of a wireless communication facility shall routinely and regularly inspect each site to ensure compliance with the standards set forth in this section.
H. The owner or operator of any wireless communication facility shall submit and maintain, at all times, current contact and site information. Applicant shall notify City of any changes to the information submitted within thirty (30) days of any change, including change of the name or legal status of the owner or operator. This information shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
    1. Identity, including name, address, and telephone number, and legal status of the owner of the facility including official identification numbers and FCC certification, and, if different from the owner, the identity and legal status of the person or entity responsible for operating the facility;
    2. Name, address and telephone number of a local contact person for emergencies;
    3. Type of service provided;
    4. Identification signs, including emergency phone numbers of the utility provider, shall be posted at all communication facility sites.
I. Discontinuation of Use. 
    1. All facilities and equipment associated with a wireless communication facility shall be removed within thirty (30) days of the discontinuation of the use and the site shall be restored to its original preconstruction condition.
    2. The service provider shall provide the City with a notice of intent to vacate a site a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to vacation.
    3. If such facilities or equipment are not removed within thirty (30) days after the permit has lapsed under subsection (A) of this section, the site shall be deemed to be a nuisance pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 9.24, and the City may cause the equipment be removed at the owner’s expense or by calling any bond or other financial assurance to pay for removal. If there are two (2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. For facilities to be located on public property, this removal requirement, and appropriate bonding requirement, shall be included within the terms of the lease. For facilities to be located on private property, since the subject property owner shall be ultimately responsible for removal of the equipment, the terms of private leases are encouraged to include the equipment removal as a provision of the lease. (Ord. 1039 (part), 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 930 § 2, 2004. Formerly 18.51.060)

18.51.080 Conditional Use Permit.
A. A conditional use permit is required for any communications facility as specified under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.51.040 and subject to the findings as provided below under subsection (D) of this section. Such facilities may be conditionally approved in the districts where they are allowed, unless exempt from the provisions of this chapter as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.51.045.
B. Where approval for a conditional use permit is being considered for a wireless communications tower or monopole, the applicant will be required as a condition of approval to allow future applicants to co-locate their antennas at the approved facility. The Planning Commission may allow an exception to this requirement if the applicant can provide evidence that such co-location would cause an adverse impact on the applicant’s operation.
C. As part of project approval, the Planning Commission, or Zoning Administrator, as applicable, may require additional screening and/or landscaping, undergrounding, an alternative color scheme, or relocation of a tower or ancillary equipment to a less obtrusive area of the site where it would have a less prominent visual presence due to slope, topography, size or relationship to public rights-of-way.
D. In addition to the findings listed in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.76.050 (Use Permits), the Planning Commission shall make the following findings:
    1. That the proposed communication facility has been designed in conformance with the requirements of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.51.060;
    2. For projects filed under Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.51.040(A)(2) and (A)(5), the Planning Commission must find, based on substantial evidence presented in the record, that there are no other compliant alternatives to this proposal, and that strict application of the City’s site development standards is technologically infeasible, would result in an unreasonable interference with signal quality, or prohibits adequate development of facilities to serve all areas within the City, to promote competition and achieve open access.
E. The City Council may waive or modify requirements of this chapter upon advice of the City Attorney that denial of an application would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services, unreasonably discriminating among service providers, or constituting any other violation of state or federal law. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that the denial would result in such a violation. (Ord. 1039 (part), 2019; Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 930 § 2, 2004. Formerly 18.51.070)

Upon receipt of an application for a planned unit development, the Planning Commission shall make such investigation and study of the proposed plan as they shall deem necessary, and shall set a time for a public hearing on the application. The Planning Commission shall give notice of the time, place and purpose of the public hearing in the same manner as provided for hearings on use permit applications in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.76.
In approving any planned unit development, the conditions imposed by the Planning Commission may include, but are not limited to, the time within which a project must be started and be completed; a listing of variances permitted; revised boundaries of the project; uses permitted, and specification of minimum standards.
Application for, and approval of, a planned unit development wherein variances from the standard zoning regulations are approved or wherein uses normally requiring use permits are allowed, shall be deemed to be in compliance with all the necessary procedures for securing or granting a variance or a use permit.
The Planning Commission shall act upon the application within forty-five (45) days of the first hearing date, excluding such time as may be necessary to complete any required zoning reclassification. In taking action, the Planning Commission may recommend approval of the application as submitted, or may recommend denial of the application or may recommend approval subject to certain conditions.

18.55.010 Purpose.
To establish for certain areas of the community a level of planning and development policy which will be consistent with the General Plan, yet sufficiently flexible to permit detailed planning at the time of development. The Planned Development (P-D) District is designed to allow inclusion within its boundaries of a mixture of uses, building intensities or design characteristics which would not normally be permitted in any single use district. This variation is permitted only through the adoption by the City of a precise development plan showing proper orientation, desirable design character and interrelationship and compatibility of land uses. The P-D District is intended to be employed in areas where tracts of land are subject to potential development and where coordination of such development is essential to achieve unique and innovative community design. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 463 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.55.020 Standards and Requirements.
The following regulations shall apply in a P-D District, which district shall also be subject to other provisions of this title, except that where conflict in regulation occurs, the requirements specified in this chapter or on a site plan approved pursuant to this chapter, shall apply:
A. The minimum area on which a P-D District may be established shall be four (4) acres of contiguous land. However, a P-D District may be established for an area of less than four (4) contiguous acres if the Planning Commission and the City Council find that the property is suitable as a P-D District by virtue of its relationship to adjacent parcels and their development plan (existing or proposed), unique historical character, topography, or landscaping features, or by virtue of its qualifying as an isolated problem area.
B. Land uses permitted in any other district may be permitted in the P-D District, provided such use or uses are in harmony with each other and serve to fulfill the function of the planned development, while complying with the General Plan, including the density or intensity of development prescribed for the property as shown in the General Plan.
C. Standards for lot area frontage and width, coverage, FAR, yards, building heights, landscaping and parking for uses in a P-D District shall be the standards of the zoning district governing uses most similar in nature and function to the uses proposed in the P-D District. For detached single-family residential developments, the R-1 District standards apply. For duplex development or single-family and duplex combined development, the R-2 District standards apply. For multifamily and dwelling group development, the R-3 District standards apply. Exceptions to these standards may be allowed by the Planning Commission and the City Council, when it can be demonstrated that such exceptions would result in a more desirable development and are warranted in terms of the relationship of the total proposed development or units thereof with the General Plan.
D. All land designated parks and/or open space shall be conveyed, at the option of the City, by one of the following procedures:
    1. It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture establishing an association of property owners or similar organization, subject to covenants running with the land, satisfactory to the City Attorney, which restrict the open space to the uses specified by the development plan, which provide for the maintenance of the open space in a manner that assures its continuing use for its intended purpose, and which provide legal means for the City to enforce these provisions;
    2. It may be conveyed to the City in a manner satisfactory to the City Attorney.
E. The streets, bike paths and pedestrian ways within and bordering a P-D District shall be offered for dedication to the City. Standards for public improvements shall be governed by applicable ordinances and laws of the City or shall be as established by the City Public Works Department for the development under consideration. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 929 §§ 54, 55, 2004; Ord. 463 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.55.030 Establishment of P-D District.
The P-D District may be established by a City-initiated zoning process or by application to the Planning Commission by one or more private property owners. If the City initiates the zoning process, the P-D zoning classification shall be established prior to the approval of a preliminary development plan, or concurrently with, or subsequent to, the adoption of a specific plan; however, the interim use of the property shall be as indicated in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.55.040. If the owner or owners initiate the zoning process, the P-D zoning classification shall not be established until the preliminary development plan is approved or a specific plan is adopted as specified in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.55.080 and 18.55.090. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 929 § 56, 2004; Ord. 463 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.55.040 City Initiated Process.
A. Procedures for establishing a Planned Development District classification for any parcel or parcels of property within the City may be initiated by the Planning Commission or the City Council in accordance with the procedures set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.80.
B. In the time period between the establishment of a P-D District and approval of a precise development plan, the permitted uses in said district shall be:
    1. Those uses permitted in an R-1 First Residential District as set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.20. No improvement, land or road grading, or subdivision of lands shall be done unless in compliance with the regulations governing the R-1 District.
    2. A temporary conditional use subject to securing a use permit in every case. Temporary conditional uses may be approved by the Planning Commission only when compatible with existing uses and with any approved preliminary plan. Said use permits may be approved for a time period not to exceed five (5) years.
    3. All legally established uses in existence at the time of the adoption of the P-D District. Such uses are considered legal, nonconforming and are subject to the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.68, Nonconforming Uses and Structures.
    The above uses are the only uses permitted in the P-D District until and unless a preliminary development plan is processed and approved by the City pursuant to the procedures set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.55.050 et seq. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or owners of land within the P-D District to prepare and submit such preliminary development plan for all of the land within the district.
C. In the event that an owner of a parcel of property within a P-D District, which district encompasses additional lands under different ownership, desires to process a plan for his property independently of other properties within the district, said owner may apply for an exception permit. The granting of an exception permit shall exempt the applicant from the requirement of coordinated application processing associated with submitting a preliminary development plan for all of the land within the district and shall allow said applicant to include only his property within such plan submission. Otherwise, said applicant shall be bound by all the provisions of the P-D District.
D. Application for an exception permit shall be made to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall grant such an exception permit only if it makes all of the following findings:
    1. An undue hardship exists for the applicant;
    2. The granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights of the applicant; and
    3. The granting of the application, under the circumstances of the particular case, will not adversely affect the health, safety or welfare or be detrimental to persons, property or improvements in the vicinity.
    Any action taken by the Planning Commission in granting or denying such an application may be appealed to the City Council pursuant to the provision of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 2.50.040. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 929 § 57, 2004; Ord. 547 § 1, 1976; Ord. 504 § 1, 1974; Ord. 463 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.55.050 Application Procedures by Private Property Owners.
An application for the establishment of a P-D District may be made to the Planning Commission by one or more private property owners. The application shall be permitted on prescribed forms and shall be accompanied by a filing fee.
In addition, the applicant shall pay the actual costs of services rendered in checking the preliminary development plan for conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Such costs may be apportioned between the owners, as they may agree upon, or may be apportioned by the proportionate parcel sizes of the property ownerships. Payment for such actual costs of services shall become due and payable upon their completion and upon receipt of a bill therefor. The preliminary development plan shall not be reviewed by the Planning Commission until such fees are paid. The application shall be signed by the owner(s) of every property within the boundaries of the proposed P-D District. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 463 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.55.060 Preliminary Development Plan Approval.
The applicant shall submit a preliminary development plan to the Planning Commission for approval. This approval shall be limited to the general acceptability of the land uses and densities proposed and their interrelationship and shall not be construed to endorse precise location of uses, configuration of parcels or engineering feasibility. The preliminary development plan and supporting material shall normally be prepared and endorsed by a qualified urban planner, and shall include the following information:
A. A topographic map of the subject property or properties, prepared by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, including metes and bounds description(s), and showing in accurate detail the topography, existing buildings and existing land features and trees;
B. Proposed land uses, residential densities, and population analysis;
C. Proposed circulation pattern, indicating both public and private vehicular and pedestrian ways, a traffic index for use on determining street structural design, and estimated traffic generation as it affects public streets within and in the vicinity of the proposed development;
D. Proposed parks, playgrounds, school sites and other open spaces, public and private;
E. Relation to present and future land use in surrounding area and to the General Plan;
F. Economic feasibility analysis of any commercial uses, if the property is not zoned for similar commercial uses at the time of submittal of the preliminary development plan;
G. An analysis of all public, quasi-public, recreational and educational areas and facilities proposed in terms of their adequacy to meet the projected needs;
H. A statement of provisions for ultimate ownership and maintenance of all parts of the development, including streets, structures and open space;
I. Preliminary report indicating provisions for storm drainage, sewage disposal and public utilities;
J. Delineation of development phases, if any;
K. Any additional information which may be required in order to determine if contemplated arrangement or uses make it desirable to apply a P-D District classification to the area under consideration;
L. The Planning Director may waive any of the above required informational items, maps, drawings, etc., if, in his opinion, they are unnecessary or unreasonable under the circumstances. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 504 § 2, 1974; Ord. 463 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.55.070 Findings Required.
The Planning Commission, after public hearing, may recommend the establishment of a P-D District, and the City Council, after public hearing may, by ordinance, establish a P-D District, providing that they find that the facts submitted with the application and presented at the hearing established as follows:
A. The proposed P-D District, or a given phase thereof, can be substantially completed within four (4) years of the establishment of the P-D District;
B. That each individual phase of development, as well as the total development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance will be provided that such objective will be attained; that the uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not adequately be achieved under other zoning districts;
C. That the streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the P-D District;
D. That any proposed commercial development can be justified economically at the locations proposed to provide for adequate commercial facilities of the types proposed;
E. That any exception from standard ordinance requirements is warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the precise site plan in accord with adopted policy of the Planning Commission and the City Council;
F. That the area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
G. That the P-D District is in conformance with the General Plan; and

18.56.010 Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to provide regulation of the number and design of storage areas for self-propelled motor vehicles in order to provide adequate parking and loading facilities for residential, commercial and public land uses and structures. Further, it is the purpose to promote the safety of pedestrians as they move to and from their automobiles, ease of ingress and egress of motor vehicles in the parking and boarding areas and enhance visual qualities. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 513 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.56.020 Definitions.
Efficiency Vehicle. An “efficiency vehicle” can be one of the following: (1) any vehicle which meets the definitions of low-emitting and fuel efficient vehicles, neighborhood electric vehicle and vanpool vehicle as defined in CALGreen Section 5.102; and (2) a carpool, as defined under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.13.040.
Floor Area. For the purposes of this chapter, “floor area” is defined as the gross floor area calculated using the outside dimensions of the structure with the exception of interior parking areas.
Seats. For the purposes of this chapter, twenty (20) inches of a pew or bench will be equivalent to a seat in determining parking requirements. If there are no fixed seats, parking requirements are to be based on floor area.
“Street width” means the average width of the physical street improvement measured perpendicular to the centerline of the street, adjacent to the site in question from:
    1. Face of curb to face of curb.
    2. Face of curb to edge of pavement.
    3. Edge of pavement to edge of pavement.
Use, New. For the purposes of this chapter only, a “new use” is defined as one with an increased parking requirement, as established by this chapter, over the parking requirement, as established by this chapter, for the existing or latest use. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 977 § 1(4), 2011; Ord. 747 § 1, 1987; Ord. 513 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.56.025 Calculation of Parking.
The parking number calculation for a business shall be based on the one use which is the primary function of the business or user as determined by the Planning Director, rather than the aggregate number of the individual functional spaces within the business. The parking calculation for a building or project shall be based upon the aggregate of the parking requirement of all the individual businesses and/or tenants. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(60), 2007; Ord. 667 § 3, 1981)

18.56.030 Applicability.
For all zoning districts, the requirements for off-street parking and loading spaces for vehicles, as provided in this chapter, shall apply under the following circumstances:
A. Construction of new structures, except accessory structures on residentially zoned properties.
B. Reconstruction and/or remodel and/or expansion of existing structures, except accessory structures on residentially zoned properties, where the total value of the reconstruction and/or remodel and/or expansion of the existing structure exceeds sixty (60) percent of the current replacement value of the original structure, as determined by the City Building Official using the most current ICC assessed valuation data with a regional modifier. Sole replacement and/or upgrading of roofing are not included.
C. Where an existing structure is structurally altered in a manner that increases the parking requirement.
D. Establishment of any new use, as defined in this chapter. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(61), 2007; Ord. 929 § 61, 2004; Ord. 698 § 8, 1983; Ord. 513 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.56.040 Location of Required Spaces.
All permitted and required off-street parking spaces, open or enclosed, shall be located on the same parcel as the use for which such spaces are required, except that the Planning Commission may, upon application for a use permit, authorize parking spaces provided on other property within a radius of two hundred fifty (250) feet of the parcel.
If the structure or use requiring off-street parking spaces is in one ownership and the land upon which the off-street parking spaces are located is in a different ownership, there shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder a covenant running with said land. Said covenant shall run to the benefit of the land upon which said structure or use is located and shall be in a form first approved by the City. Said covenant shall provide that the servient land shall continue to provide said parking spaces for so long as the use is maintained on the benefited land. It shall further provide that the servient land shall not be made subject to any other covenant or contract for use without prior written consent of the City. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(62), 2007; Ord. 513 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.56.050 Joint-Use Parking Facilities.
No parking or loading space provided about any building for purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be considered as providing parking or loading space for any other structure except under the following conditions. The Planning Commission may, upon application for a use permit by the owner or lessee of any property, authorize the joint use of parking facilities by the following uses or activities under the conditions specified herein:
A. Up to fifty (50) percent of the parking facilities required by this section for a use considered to be primarily a daytime use may be provided by the parking facilities of a use considered to be primarily a nighttime use; up to fifty (50) percent of the parking facilities required by this section for a use considered to be primarily a nighttime use may be provided by the parking facilities of a use considered to be primarily a daytime use, provided such reciprocal parking area shall be subject to conditions set forth in subsection (B) of this section.
The following uses are typical daytime uses: banks, bakery, business offices, retail stores, personal service shops, clothing or shoe repair or service shops, manufacturing or wholesale buildings and similar uses.
The following uses are typical of nighttime uses: dance halls, theaters, auditoriums and similar uses.
B. Conditions Required for Joint Use. 
    1. The structure or use for which application is being made for authority to utilize the existing off-street parking facilities provided for another structure or use, shall be located within a radius of two hundred fifty (250) feet of such parking facility.
    2. The applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the structures or uses for which the joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed.
    3. If the structure or use requiring off-street parking spaces is in one ownership, and the required parking spaces are provided in a different ownership, there shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder a covenant in a form and manner pursuant to the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.56.040.
    4. The joint-use parking facility will not be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience or general welfare of the general public or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 513 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.56.060 Multiple-Use Parking Requirements.
If more than one use is located on a site, the number of parking and loading spaces provided shall be not less than the sum of the requirements for each use except as provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.56.050. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 513 § 1 (part), 1975)

18.56.070 Single Purpose of Space.

    2. D (depth of stall): the depth of a row or bay of parking, perpendicular to the aisle;
    3. A (aisle width): width of backout and flow space between parking rows;
    4. W (width of stall): clear width of individual stall, perpendicular to the stall;
    5. L (layout dimension of stall): distance from stall to stall on centers measured parallel to the aisle – useful in laying out a parking lot;
    6. Angle of parking: angle between aisle and stall line;
    7. Confined stall: a stall which has any structure higher than a six-inch curb on both stall lines, including walls, railings, stairwells, columns or fences but excepting columns located more than seven (7) feet from aisles;
    8. End stall: a stall which has any structure (including curbs) on either of its stall lines;
    9. Permissible bumper overhang: the area beyond parking lot curbs where it is safe and legally permissible for front bumpers to extend. Public sidewalks and landscaped areas are not areas of permissible bumper overhang;
    10. High-turnover parking: parking where stalls change occupancy six (6) or more times per day;
    11. Stall dimensions:
        a. Clear stall widths shall be nine (9) feet for all end stalls, shopping centers, grocery stores, restaurants, drive-ins, retail uses, banks, public buildings, professional offices, short-term or shopper parking or parking for any high-turnover use.

        c. Relationship of stall dimensions to aisle dimensions and parking scale shall be as outlined in Tables 18.56-I and 18.56-II;
    12. Compact car stalls: substandard stalls may be permitted as compact car stalls under the following conditions:
        a. The dimensions must be as outlined in Table 18.56-III;
        b. No substandard stall may be counted as a compact stall in lots having less than twenty (20) cars. After the first twenty (20) cars, compact stalls may be permitted at a rate not to exceed one compact stall for each four (4) stalls;
        c. Further, compact stalls may be provided at a rate of three (3) additional compact stalls for each twenty (20) stalls; provided, that the difference in area between the standard stall and the compact stall will be utilized for landscaping in addition to landscaping that is otherwise required;
        d. Compact car stalls shall be clearly marked: “SMALL CARS ONLY”;
    13. Designated Parking for Efficiency Vehicles. In compliance with CALGreen Code Sections 5.106.5.2 and 5.106.5.2.1, designated parking shall be provided for any combination of low-emitting, fuel efficient and carpool/vanpool vehicles as follows:

    5. Aisles shall provide for noncongestive flow from and into the street by logical relationships with the driveways. A two-way driveway shall lead into a two-way aisle. Reversal of the “right-hand rule” of driving for two-way aisles or closely adjacent one-way drives is not acceptable;
    6. One-way aisles shall not dead end. Dead ends of two-way aisles with ninety (90) degree parking are permissible if back-around space is provided for last two (2) stalls.
C. Turning Radii, Turn-Around Requirements. 
    1. With the exception of sites containing only one single-family dwelling or one duplex, all parcels providing parking for three (3) or more cars must provide turn-around space for all stalls on site and backouts onto a public street shall not be permitted;
    2. Aisles, ramps, turn-arounds and curves shall be designed with the following minimum radii:
        a. Radius to curbs lower than nine (9) inches (wheel radius) shall have a minimum radius of twenty-eight (28) feet to the outside of the ramp and a minimum radius of twenty (20) feet to the inside of the ramp;
        b. Radius to walls, columns or structures (body overhang radius) shall have a minimum radius of thirty (30) feet to the outside of the ramp and a minimum radius of sixteen (16) feet to the inside of the ramp;
    3. Turning aisles or ramps with two-way traffic must have radii and aisle widths sufficient for two (2) cars to pass on the turn except in small parking lots of low turnover. (Ramps passing two (2) or more cars per minute in each direction during the peak hour of an average day require two-car passing widths on ramps). Ramp widths on turns shall be as follows:
        a. Minimum one-way ramp width shall be twelve (12) feet from curb to curb and fourteen (14) feet from wall to wall;
        b. Minimum two-way ramp width shall be twenty-four (24) feet from curb to curb and twenty-eight (28) feet from wall to wall.
    No portion of a circular ramp may be considered as aisle for cars in adjacent bays;
    4. For all structures other than single-family and duplex dwellings, vehicular access for Fire Department service must be provided with aisles and ramps with turning radius of eighty (80) feet to the outside edge of the ramp or aisle.
D. Truck and Loading Standards. 
    1. All loading shall take place on site, and freight-handling doors and facilities shall be oriented to legal off-street loading spaces, not to street or curb parking;
    2. For the uses listed in Table 18.56-I, off-street loading berths shall be provided on the basis of gross floor area of the building or portions thereof devoted to such uses in the amounts shown herein;
    3. Freight-handling docks shall be so located as to permit free use of aisles, drives and sidewalks during freight operation;
    4. Adequate screening of loading areas is required;
    5. Wherever the soil conditions permit, subsurface loading berths shall be constructed for buildings with gross leaseable floor areas in excess of one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet;
    6. Period of deliveries of goods may be established by the Planning Director for each commercial establishment.
E. Handicap Stalls. Parking stalls for the use of the physically handicapped must be provided in accordance to the standards set herein:
    1. Handicapped stalls shall have a minimum width of twelve (12) feet;
    2. Stalls for the handicapped must be located adjacent to pedestrian walks of the development to facilitate access to the buildings of the development;
    3. These parking spaces must be opened on one side to allow room for individuals in wheelchairs or on braces and crutches to get in and out of an automobile onto a level surface suitable for wheeling and walking;
    4. The stalls for the handicapped must be located such that handicapped individuals are not compelled to wheel or walk behind parked cars;
    5. Parking stalls set aside for the physically handicapped must be denoted by the physically handicapped symbol adopted by the state. A sign stating “parking for handicapped persons” or some wording to that effect may be included;
    6. Curbs adjacent to handicap stalls must be provided with ramps.
F. Pedestrian Aisles. In all parking lots with fifty (50) spaces or more a pedestrian aisle or aisles shall be provided to protect pedestrians.
    1. The aisles shall extend from the building entrances to the extreme limits of the parking lot;
    2. The pedestrian aisle should have a minimum width of four (4) feet. This area is not a permissible area for bumper overhang and shall be designed so as to protect the pedestrian from automobile traffic.
G. Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking or loading areas shall be arranged so as to direct the light away from the adjoining premises in any R and A-P Districts.
H. Covering of Parking Spaces. In all R Districts, one-half of the required parking spaces (not guest parking spaces) must be covered.
I. Physical Construction. 
    1. Any off-street parking or loading area shall be surfaced with an asphaltic or Portland cement concrete pavement or other paving unit acceptable to the City Engineer which shall be so graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulated within the area, and shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for the orderly and safe loading, parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles.
    2. Parking lots and garages shall be adequately drained. The minimum slope for drainage shall be 0.75 percent unless there are physical limitations of construction in which event the minimum slope may be reduced to 0.50 percent. The maximum slope allowable in the storage areas of parking lots is five (5) percent.
    3. Stall markings shall be installed and maintained in conformance with approved plans.
    4. Bumper curbs, walls, fences or planting areas shall be provided at the back of sidewalks and along property lines or other lines delineating the parking area.
    5. Ramp design in multilevel garages shall provide for slopes mild enough to ensure driver visibility of the pavement at all times.
    6. Planted areas are encouraged, and shall be of adequate size and shall be sprinkled to ensure continued maintenance (refer to parking landscaping standards).
    7. Aisle and stall marking should be double lines of striping at least four (4) inches wide and separated by at least nine (9) inches.

This regulation shall not be interpreted as supplanting other regulations of this title which require greater landscaped strips, yards or setbacks.
E. Parking lots with more than one hundred (100) stalls shall be designed to visually isolate, compound or group the stalls into subareas of no more than one hundred (100) stalls each by means of walls, fences, landscaped buffer strips of no less than ten (10) feet in width, changes in elevation of the parking surfaces or other means to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission.

18.60.030 Sign Permit Requirement and Approval.
A. Except for those signs conforming to the limitations of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.050, it is unlawful to erect any new sign or modify the appearance of an existing sign without first securing a sign permit. Normal maintenance of a sign in conformance with original appearance, or change of copy on the existing sign face where there is no change to the design and dimensions, shall not be deemed modification and shall not require a sign permit.

The Commission may approve the sign permit if it is found to be in conformance with the purpose of this chapter and the design criteria provided in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.060(H), and in substantial conformance with the standards for mode of display, size, height, illumination and design stated in this chapter for similar signs. Applications shall be processed and noticed in accordance with Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.60.040 and 18.76.030. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 953 § 1(68), 2007; Ord. 857 § 8 (part), 1993; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.060 Permitted Identification Signs for Places of Business.
In addition to the affiliation, directional, nameplate, window, tenant directory, and other exempt signs, each place of business (other than a home occupation and a business or use located in a multitenant office or mixed use building with more than one story) shall be permitted identification signing pursuant to the limitations of this section and Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.100. Home occupations shall be permitted identification signing pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.080. For any identification sign subject to Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission approval (i.e., signs exceeding six (6) square feet, or signs approved under a coordinated signing program), more restrictive limitations upon the number, mode of display, size, height and illumination may be imposed instead of those stated in subsections (B) through (G) of this section. Prior to imposing more restrictive limitations, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission must first find that the action is necessary to meet the design criteria of subsection (H) of this section. Further, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission shall state how the proposed sign fails to meet the design criteria, and how the more restrictive limitations will implement those criteria. The signing limitations are as follows:
A. Multitenant Office or Mixed Use with More Than One Story. Where a business or use is located in a multiple-tenant office building, or mixed use building with more than one story, and/or where such business or use has no primary business facade, or is located on a floor above or below the ground floor level, identification shall be limited to a listing on a tenant directory sign mounted at the building entry and a tenant listing on the business center sign constructed in conformance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.070.
B. Number. 
    1. Except as further delineated in subsection (B)(2) of this section, each place of business may be permitted a maximum of one identification sign for each business facade, up to a maximum of four (4) signs per place of business (one sign per business facade).
    2. Either one primary identification sign or a primary identification wall sign and an architectural sign feature may be permitted on the designated primary business facade. The combined square footage of the sign and architectural sign feature shall not exceed that permitted for a primary identification wall sign.
    3. One secondary identification sign may be permitted on any secondary business facades.
C. Mode of Display. 
    1. Primary identification signs may be a freestanding, projecting, or wall sign.
    2. Secondary identification signs may be a projecting or wall sign only.
    3. Signs shall not be erected upon a business facade other than that which creates the sign entitlement, and a freestanding sign shall not be oriented toward a street frontage other than that faced by the business facade creating the entitlement.
D. Size of Projecting and Freestanding Signs. 
    1. A primary projecting or freestanding sign may be a maximum of either one square foot per three (3) lineal feet of business facade, or fifty (50) square feet, whichever is less.
    2. Secondary projecting identification signs may be permitted a maximum of fifty (50) percent of the size that would be permitted a primary sign.
E. Size of Wall Signs. 
    1. A maximum of either one square foot of identification signing per one lineal foot of the primary business facade, or one hundred (100) square feet, whichever is less, may be permitted a primary wall identification sign; except that any primary business facade shall be permitted at least ten (10) square feet of signing for a primary wall identification sign.
    2. Secondary wall identification signs may be permitted a maximum of fifty (50) percent of the size that would be permitted a primary sign for the facade.
F. Height. Sign height shall be subject to the following limitations:
    1. The maximum height of freestanding signs shall be ten (10) feet measured from finish grade elevation at the sign base to the uppermost part of the sign or supporting structure.
    2. The uppermost part of a projecting sign, wall sign or architectural sign feature shall not exceed the lowest part of the roof structure corresponding to the wall upon which the sign is erected.
    3. Unless otherwise authorized by the Public Works Department, a minimum ground clearance of eight (8) feet shall be required for any sign, or architectural sign feature, projecting over a pedestrian walkway.
G. Illumination. Sign illumination shall be subject to the following limitations:
    1. Except when proposed in writing and expressly approved, the light source shall not be visible from any off-site point or any on-site pedestrian or vehicular accessway;
    2. External light sources shall be directed and shielded to prevent direct illumination of any object other than the sign;
    3. Illumination intensity shall be less than that which causes glare to be reflected upon any adjacent property or public street;
    4. Illuminated signs shall not exceed the illumination level of their visual background to the extent of causing diversion of a motorist’s attention from the path of travel;
    5. As a condition of sign permit approval, the Zoning Administrator may require and perform a post-installation intensity inspection to occur within sixty (60) days of installation completion, and the Zoning Administrator may require alteration of the light intensity or the method of illumination if found necessary to implement these illumination limitations.
H. Design. The location of the sign on the site or building, the sign colors, shape, finish materials and the arrangement thereof shall be designed to be architecturally a part of, and not in conflict with, the shape and mass of the building materials, form, the color and composition of exterior building, and the location of architectural elements such as doors, windows, canopies and rooflines of the building to which the sign refers, and of adjacent buildings and signs. Readerboard designs shall be permitted only after a finding has been made by the Zoning Administrator that use of changeable copy will not conflict with these design criteria.
I. Coordinated Signing Program. Identification signs for places of business located within a shopping center and all center identification signs may be designed and approved pursuant to a coordinated signing program that has been approved by the Planning Commission. An application for approval of a coordinated sign program shall be made to the Planning Department and shall include the information described in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.60.040(A) through (F).
The establishment of a sign program may allow flexibility in the application of the sign standards and provisions contained in this chapter under certain circumstances, as follows:
    1. Purpose. Sign programs are specifically intended for unique use and property circumstances with the purpose of addressing multiple uses on one site or multiple signs for uses with special sign needs. Sign programs shall be used to achieve aesthetic compatibility between the signs within a project, and may allow some flexibility in the number, size, type and placement of signs; however, a sign program may not propose the use of prohibited signs listed under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.100.
    2. Applicability. Sign programs are permitted specifically for business centers, shopping centers, gasoline or fueling stations, automobile or vehicle dealerships and movie theatres only. Sign programs shall not be used for other uses or conditions with the intent to deviate from the provisions of this chapter.
    3. Design. Sign programs shall be designed to ensure all signs will have a compatible or cohesive design theme while allowing for individual identity and creative sign design, and shall provide specific criteria such as permitted placement, materials, size, number, colors and illumination.
    4. Findings Required for Approval of a Sign Program. The Planning Commission/Zoning Administrator shall make the following findings in rendering a decision on a sign program:
        a. All of the signs contained in the program will have one or more common design elements such as permitted placement, materials, illumination, sign type, letter size and letter type.
        b. All of the signs contained in the program are in harmony and scale with the materials, architecture, and other design features of buildings and property improvements they identify; and
        c. The amount and placement of signage contained in the program is in scale with the subject property and improvements, as well as the immediately surrounding area. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 953 § 1(70), 2007; Ord. 933 § 3, 2004; Ord. 857 § 8, 1993; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.070 Permitted Business Center Identification and Residential Gateway Signs.
A. In addition to the identification signs permitted for places of business, one freestanding or projecting sign, not to exceed fifty (50) square feet, or one wall sign, not to exceed one hundred (100) square feet, may be permitted on each separate street frontage of a business center. Center identification signs shall be subject to the height, illumination, design and coordinated signing program limitations of Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.60.060(F) through (I) and shall be subject to the limitations of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.100. A center identification sign that is approved as part of a coordinated signing program shall remain in conformance with the approved program.
B. In addition to nameplate signs permitted under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.050, one freestanding sign up to fifty (50) square feet, or one wall sign up to one hundred (100) square feet, may be permitted to identify a neighborhood, residential planned development, residential subdivision, condominium or apartment complex consisting of five (5) or more units. These gateway signs shall be subject to the height, illumination and design criteria of Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.60.060(F), (G) and (H). (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 953 § 1(71), 2007; Ord. 857 § 9, 1993; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.080 Permitted Identification Signs for Home Occupations.
Each home occupation may be permitted a maximum of one sign, not to exceed four (4) square feet in area. The sign may be freestanding, projecting or wall mounted. It shall be nonilluminated and subject to the height and design limitations of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.060(F) and (H), and subject to the limitations of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.100. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.090 Calculation of Sign Area.
For the purpose of applying sign size regulations, the following criteria shall be used to calculate sign area:
A. For single-faced signs, area shall be that within the outermost border of the sign. A single-faced sign is a sign constructed so its message is displayed in a single plane and is viewable from only one side of the plane.
B. For double-faced signs, area shall be that within the outermost border of one face of the sign. A double-faced sign is a sign constructed to display its message(s) on the outside surfaces of two (2) identical and/or opposite parallel planes, provided the planes are not more than two (2) feet apart.
C. For multiple-faced signs, area shall be the sum of the areas within the outermost border of each face. A multiple-faced sign is a sign constructed to display its message either on a curved surface or on two (2) or more planar surfaces, excepting signs that qualify as double-faced signs.
D. For borderless signs, area shall be that within a single polygon drawn with straight lines and right-angle corners to enclose all sign parts. A borderless sign is a sign composed of parts of a message without a single border enclosing any of the parts (for example, individual letters erected upon a wall constitute a borderless sign).
E. The area of sign-support structures such as posts or brackets shall be calculated as sign area only when the appearance of such structures attracts attention for advertising, instruction or information. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.100 Prohibited Signing Characteristics.
The following characteristics shall be prohibited in all signs:
A. Any sign of a type described in Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.60.050 through 18.60.080 which has a size or other characteristic exceeding any limitation stated in the description shall be prohibited.
B. Hazards to Exits. No sign shall be erected in such a manner that any portion of the sign or its support is attached to, or will interfere with, the free use of any fire escape, exit or standpipe. No sign shall be erected which will obstruct any required stairway, door ventilator or window.
C. Hazards to Traffic. No sign shall be erected in such a manner that it will or reasonably may be expected to interfere with, obstruct, confuse or mislead traffic. All signs shall conform to the height limitation of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.16.090.
D. Motion. Except for exempt flags, any sign constructed to incorporate windblown materials, moving parts or the appearance of motion by use of flashing or reflected light or other devices shall be prohibited.
E. Off-Site Location. Except for the following exempt signs, no sign shall be located other than on the same parcel of land from which the product, service or activity described by the sign is made available. Exempt off-site real estate signs, political signs and special events signs may be erected off site when they comply with the limitations described in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.050.
F. Roof Locations. Signs erected upon any part of a roof or false roof structure shall be prohibited.
G. Vehicle Locations. Signs erected upon a vehicle shall be prohibited.
H. Visible Gaseous Illumination. Signs in excess of four (4) square feet incorporating visible gaseous illumination shall be prohibited. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.110 Nonconforming Signs.
A. Any sign lawfully erected prior to December 2, 1977, which exceeds the limitations of Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.60.010 through 18.60.100 shall be deemed legal nonconforming and may continue to exist until made nonconforming by the earliest of the following events:
    1. Any modification of sign appearance, other than normal maintenance necessary to retain the original appearance of the sign; or
    2. Removal of the sign, except when removal is done for maintenance and the sign is re-erected within fourteen (14) days; or
    3. Change of use or business, or termination of the business which existed on December 2, 1977; or
    4. Destruction or deterioration of the sign to an extent that the current cost of repair exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current cost of constructing a new sign which duplicates the old.
B. Upon becoming nonconforming, any sign shall immediately be removed or made to comply with all requirements of this chapter.
C. All signs deemed legal nonconforming by this section shall be made to comply with the requirements of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.60.120 within ninety (90) days of December 2, 1977.
D. Any sign unlawfully erected prior to December 2, 1977, shall be deemed nonconforming and shall be immediately removed. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 953 § 1(72), 2007; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.120 Maintenance.
All signs shall be continuously maintained in conformance with the standards of appearance extant at the time of original erection and in compliance with the Uniform Building Code requirements. Deteriorated or damaged paint and construction materials shall be immediately renewed. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 974 § 1, 2010; Ord. 580 § 1 (part), 1977)

18.60.130 Penalty for Violations.
Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Sections 18.60.030 or 18.60.100 is guilty of an infraction and, upon conviction thereof, is punishable by:
A. A fine not exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00) for a first violation;

18.64.010 Purpose.
A. The key design goals of the City include:
    1. Maintaining a proper balance between manmade features and the natural environment. The location, design, material and color of manmade development should harmonize and be compatible with the natural setting.
    2. Preserving the unique character of Larkspur neighborhoods and commercial areas.
    3. Promoting new construction that is in harmony with the physical characteristics of the site and compatible with existing residential neighborhoods and commercial areas.
    4. Fostering consideration of neighbors’ concerns with respect to privacy, scale and massing, solar access, and streetscape.
B. It is in the public interest in order to promote and protect the safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of this City and to preserve and to enhance the social, economic and visual values in the City that we:
    1. Preserve and enhance the natural beauties of the land and of the manmade environment, and the enjoyment thereof.
    2. Maintain and improve the qualities of and relationships between individual buildings, structures and physical developments in such manner as to contribute best to the amenities and attractiveness of the City.
    3. Protect and ensure the adequacy and usefulness of public and private developments as they relate to the site, each other, and to the neighborhood.
    4. Give guidance to the functioning, appearance and location of buildings and improvements so as to maintain and enhance a balance between private prerogatives and preferences and the public safety and welfare.
C. In order to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change, it is necessary for the City of Larkspur to ensure that site planning, building design, and construction practices promote resource conservation through climate-responsive design, use of renewable energy and resources, and green building techniques.
D. It is further necessary and essential to a rational and continued improvement of our City that we prevent the erosion of beauty and decay of environmental amenities by:
    1. Stimulating creative design for individual buildings, groups of buildings and structures, and other physical developments.
    2. Encouraging the innovative use of materials, methods and techniques.
    3. Preserving balance and harmony within neighborhoods.

18.64.050 Criteria for Approval of Applications.
Review shall be guided by the following criteria, as may be applicable to each application, for the purpose of assuring that with regard to buildings, structures and physical improvements each proposed development shall accomplish the purposes set forth in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.64.010.
A. Competent Design. Development has been designed by and bears the signature of a person who under the building code has been designated as legally competent to submit such development proposal. The overall design may be directed towards buildings of any architectural characteristic; however, there must be a consistent organization of materials and openings, and a harmonious relationship of major elements; decorative parts must relate to the character of the design.
B. Preservation of Natural Landscape. The structure and/or addition shall be designed in a manner such that impacts to any environmental features on or near the lot, including but not limited to stream courses, marshlands, prominent trees and landforms, etc., are minimized to the greatest extent possible. Grade changes shall be minimized and shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas. Open areas shall be preserved to the extent practicable. Overall, the extent of the improvements shall be compatible with the topographical and geologic constraints imposed by the site.
C. Relationship Between Structures Within the Development and Between Structures and the Site. There shall be a harmonious and pleasing relationship between the various structures of the development on the site and between the structures and the site itself. The proposed structures should be designed to fit the site and not vice versa.
D. Relationship Between Development and Neighborhood. Proposed structures and site development shall be related harmoniously and have good space relationship to the terrain and to existing structures and development in the vicinity. The design shall show that due regard has been given to orientation of structures to streets, climatic considerations and, especially, the creation and utilization of vistas and open space.
E. Materials and Colors for Multiple-Unit Residential, Mixed-Use, or Nonresidential Construction. Soft and muted colors similar to earth tone and natural materials are preferred and generally should predominate. Other colors and materials are acceptable if they are appropriate for and compatible with the neighborhood or commercial area in which a project is proposed.
    1. Earth tone colors are considered to be various shades of reddish-brown, brown, tan, ochre, umber, gold, sand, green, white and gray. The following are ordinarily not considered appropriate as predominant colors: bright blue, bright yellow, bright orange, bright violet, bright magenta, bright green or metallic finishes.
    2. Natural materials include adobe, slump block, brick, stone, stucco, wood and clay tile roofs.
    3. Glazing. Glare-reducing and color-harmonizing finishes may be required on glass surfaces, when such surfaces are exposed to the direct rays of the sun for any substantial part of the day. Opaque treatment is to be used where glass surfaces would otherwise permit a view of pipes, utilities and other service units. Reflective glass shall be avoided.
    4. Roofs (including equipment, but excluding skylights) are to be composed of earth tone or wood tone matte finishes that minimize reflectivity.
    5. Metal Buildings or Finishes. Unpainted metal, galvanized metal or metal subject to ordinary rusting may not be used. Metals that develop an attractive oxidized finish may be used; copper or weathering steel are examples of such materials.
    6. Concrete surfaces which are exposed to view must be colored, textured, sculptured, patterned and/or serve a design function as opposed to a mere structural function.
F. Materials and Colors for Single-Family and Duplex Construction. Materials and colors should be appropriate to the house style and character and compatible with the site and character of the neighborhood. Highly reflective surfaces should be avoided.
G. Walls, Fences and Screening. Walls, fences or screening shall be employed in a skillful manner and in harmony with the design of the development to conceal and to screen parking and loading areas, garbage and refuse collection areas and mechanical equipment from public view from adjoining streets, from persons residing on or working in the development or from persons residing or working in the neighborhood. Retaining walls that are part of a structure should be concealed by and integral to the proposed structure. Large retaining walls in a uniform plane should be avoided; height and visual impact should be minimized.
H. Driveways, Parking and Circulation, and Pathways for Vehicular, Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation Use, Both Exterior and Interior. Special attention shall be given to (1) the location and number of access points to the public streets, waterways, shorelines and open space areas, (2) general interior circulation, (3) separation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic, and (4) arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient insofar as practical. Such facilities should not detract from the design of the proposed building and structures or from adjoining or neighboring properties. Due consideration must be given to the effect of the development on adjoining sites and properties and to the loading capacities of adjoining streets.
I. Fire Safety. Proposed structures and site development shall be designed in accordance with any recommendations of the Fire Chief and the City’s adopted Fire Safety Hillside Development Standards, if applicable.
J. Garbage and Refuse Collection Areas. Garbage and refuse collection areas shall be of adequate size and located in areas convenient both to users and to persons who make collections. Utility service meters shall be appropriately screened from view of adjacent properties and the street.
K. Signs. Signs shall be so designed as to be skillfully integrated into the development and not detract from the overall appearance of the project or of surrounding areas or developments.
L. Lighting. Exterior light sources shall not create a glare or hazard on adjoining streets or be annoying to adjacent properties or residential areas. The location of lights and electric conduits in landscaped areas shall be coordinated with the landscaping and irrigation plans.
M. Landscaping. Landscaping shall be well designed with appropriate variations and shall be included as an integral enhancement of the site and, where needed, for the purposes of screening. Plant materials shall be suitable for the functions to be served. Irrigation systems may be required, and their location shall be coordinated with the plan for the location of plants. All landscaping shall be maintained in good condition and any dead or dying plants, bushes or trees shall be replaced with new healthy stock as appropriate.
N. Construction. Temporary construction visual, noise and air pollution shall be minimized through retention of natural vegetation, rock formations and topography until applicant is prepared, once grading starts, to continue immediately with the construction applied for through to completion as one continuous process. The period of construction shall be of a duration reasonable to the size and complexity of the development. During grading, dust prevention must be emphasized to avoid unnecessary annoyance to persons living or working in the area.
O. Historic Preservation. For properties zoned H (Combining Heritage Preservation District) or identified on the City’s local listing of historic structures, as approved by the City Council, the following additional criteria shall apply:
    1. Conformance to the standards listed in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.19.040(A);
    2. Conformance to the historic preservation design guidelines, as adopted by City Council resolution.
P. Repealed by Ord. 984.
Q. Green Building. The project incorporates sufficient green building measures to meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the applicable state and local green building regulations as set forth by the California Green Building Standards (CALGreen) Code and Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 15.17. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 984 § 1, 2012; Ord. 977 § 1(8), 2011; Ord. 956 § 2(3), 2007; Ord. 945 §§ 3, 4, 2004; Ord. 933 § 4, 2004; Ord. 929 § 64, 2004; Ord. 857 § 4 (part), 1993; Ord. 841 § 4, 1993; Ord. 592 § 4, 1978; Ord. 448 § 1 (part), 1973)

18.64.055 Findings for Approval of Applications.

A. Criteria. The proposed structure or alteration is substantially in conformance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.64.050, Criteria for Approval of Applications.
B. Compatibility with Neighbors. The height, elevations, and placement on the site of the proposed structure or addition are compatible with the prevailing neighborhood character and scale and with the existing pattern of development in the neighborhood and/or commercial area. Further, the proposed structure or addition avoids significant and unreasonable loss or interference with privacy, light, solar access, and prominent scenic views (i.e., views of hillsides, Mt. Tamalpais, and San Francisco Bay from primary living areas).
C. Bulk. The orientation and scale of the proposed structure or addition in relation to the immediate neighborhood minimizes the perception of excessive bulk. The proposed structure or addition employs architectural features and details, which minimize, rather than accentuate, the prominence of the structure.
D. Overall Design. Architectural features of multiple structures, additions, or design elements combine together in an attractive and visually cohesive manner. Further, the overall composition of the proposed structure or addition is compatible with and complements the historic, architectural, and/or aesthetic character of the neighborhood or commercial area. These considerations include, but are not limited to, the structure’s architectural style, size, design quality, use of building materials, and similar elements (e.g., relative to residential development, garage location, garage doors (number and size), window styles, front porches or entry stoops).
E. Other Plans and Regulations. The project is consistent with any applicable specific, area, or precise plans and conforms to the standards and regulations of all applicable provisions of the Larkspur Municipal Code.
F. Public Health, Safety and Welfare. The location, size, design, and characteristics of the proposed structure(s) are compatible with and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the persons residing in or working in the proposed structures or in developments adjacent to the proposed project. This includes the layout of the structures, parking, circulation, pathways, landscaping, and other amenities proposed for the site.
G. Green Building. The project design includes features that foster renewable energy and/or resource conservation, and the overall project (i.e., site design, building construction, energy efficiency, and waste reduction) meets or exceeds the applicable compliance threshold for green building as set forth by the California Green Building Standards (CALGreen) Code and/or Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 15.17.

18.68.020 Development Standards for Nonconforming Structures and Structures with Nonconforming Uses.
A. Repair, Maintenance and Alterations. 
    1. A building permit may be issued for interior work to repair, maintain or alter nonconforming structures and structures with nonconforming uses regardless of whether the work is located in the conforming or nonconforming portion of the structure.
    2. A building permit may be issued for work proposed to repair, maintain or improve the exterior of nonconforming structures and structures with nonconforming uses, including the nonconforming portion of the structure; provided, there are no changes to exterior openings (e.g., doors or windows), decks, or roof height of the nonconforming portion of the structure, and the cost of construction does not exceed sixty (60) percent of the current replacement value of the structure, as determined by the City Building Official using the most current ICC assessed valuation data with a regional modifier.
    3. Except as provided for in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.68.035, an exception permit shall be required for work proposed to repair, maintain or improve the exterior of nonconforming structures and structures with nonconforming uses when changes to exterior openings (e.g., doors and windows), decks, or roof height of the nonconforming portion of the building are proposed, or when the cost of construction exceeds sixty (60) percent of the current replacement value of the structure, as determined by the City Building Official using the most current ICC assessed valuation data with a regional modifier. An exception permit shall be processed in accordance with Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.68.040.
    4. Maintaining a Nonconforming Setback. Except as provided for in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.68.035, if a foundation and the exterior walls above it, which encroach into a required setback, are removed or replaced, such foundation and walls shall be reconstructed in compliance with the setback regulations in the district. Minimum standards to retain a nonconforming setback are as follows:
        a. Retain exterior wall and the existing foundation it rests upon. The exterior wall shall, at a minimum, retain studs and inner sheathing; or
        b. Retain the exterior wall studs and the fully framed and sheathed roof above for that portion of the building located within the required setback.
B. Damage. 
    1. In the R-1 and T-R zones, nonconforming structures and structures with nonconforming uses that have been damaged or destroyed, due to any means other than voluntary demolition, may be repaired or reconstructed to the footprint, building envelope, floor area, and exterior door, window and deck placement of the original structure, including its nonconforming features, subject to the following conditions:
        a. Documentation of the original structure is provided in the form of blueprints, photographs, or other documentation satisfactory to the Planning Director. If such documentation does not exist, or is deemed inadequate, an exception permit shall be required.
        b. If a safety issue exists on the property (e.g., geological hazard), the Planning Director may require an exception permit.
        c. Reconstruction that involves changes to the exterior openings (e.g., doors or windows), decks, or roof height of the nonconforming portion of the structure may be permitted, subject to an exception permit.
        d. Reconstruction must commence within two (2) years of the date the damage becomes known or should have been known. Upon request of the property owner, the Planning Commission may grant up to a one-year extension for the reconstruction time limit.
    2. In zones other than the R-1 and T-R Zoning Districts, nonconforming duplexes, multiple-family, and commercial structures and structures with nonconforming uses that have been damaged, due to any means other than voluntary demolition, may be repaired or restored to the footprint, building envelope, floor area, and exterior door, window, and deck placement of the original structure, including its nonconforming features, only where the cost of restoration does not exceed sixty (60) percent of the current replacement cost for the original structure. Such restoration shall comply with the requirements of subsections (B)(1)(a) through (d) of this section. If the cost of restoration of the structure exceeds sixty (60) percent of the current replacement cost, as determined by the City Building Official using the most current ICC assessed valuation data with a regional modifier, the structure shall not be restored unless made to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is entitled.
C. Expansion of Nonconforming Structures. 
    1. Nonconforming structures may be expanded with a building permit; provided, that no exacerbation of the existing nonconformity shall occur, and that the expansion meets all other zoning regulations. Accepting that otherwise permitted in this chapter, a variance application shall be required for any proposal to increase existing nonconforming aspects of a structure.
    2. In the R-1 Zoning District, nonconforming second units in existence prior to September 3, 1983, shall not be enlarged in area or reconfigured without being brought into compliance with Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.23, Accessory Dwelling Units.
D. Expansion and/or Relocation of Nonconforming Uses. 
    1. In zones other than residential, nonconforming uses and structures with nonconforming uses, and structures on properties with nonconforming uses, shall not be relocated or enlarged so as to occupy a greater area of land or building than occupied at the time the use became nonconforming, unless a use permit is granted for such change. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded to displace a conforming use. To grant such a use permit, the Planning Commission shall find, in addition to the findings required by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.76.050, at least one of the following circumstances exist:
        a. The resultant use will help preserve a historic resource; or
        b. The resultant use will reduce current or potential adverse impacts on adjacent properties due to the conditions of the site and/or building or its relationship to the surrounding neighborhood.
    2. In the R-1 and T-R Zoning Districts, duplexes, multiple-family dwellings, and dwelling groups may be expanded by no more than a maximum of one hundred (100) square feet per dwelling unit. Such expansion must be attached directly to an existing dwelling (i.e., no new detached structures, and no expansion of accessory structures), and cannot be aggregated (i.e., expansion of two hundred (200) square feet on one dwelling where two (2) dwellings exist on a site). Such expansion shall also be subject to approval of an exception permit, provided the proposed expansion conforms to all other zoning regulations.
    3. Except as provided in this section, no nonconforming use, including nonconforming densities in the residential districts, shall be enlarged or extended so as to occupy a greater area of land or building than occupied at the time it became a nonconforming use.
E. Discontinuation of Nonconforming Uses. Whenever a nonconforming use has been abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of one hundred eighty (180) days, subsequent use of such land and/or structure shall be in conformance with the provisions of this title.
F. Public Health, Safety, and Welfare. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent repairs or maintenance necessary to comply with existing codes or ordinances or the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building, structure, or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any public official charged with the responsibility of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 975 § 4, 2011; Ord. 953 § 1(77, 78, 79), 2007; Ord. 929 § 67, 2004; Ord. 901 § 1 (part), 2000)

18.68.030 Nonconforming Structures and Structures with Nonconforming Uses: Multifamily Residential and Commercial.
Repealed by Ord. 929. (Ord. 901 § 1 (part), 2000)

18.68.035 Nonconforming Residential Structures Listed on the Historic Resources Inventory.
The intent of this section is to allow for the repair and maintenance of existing nonconformities and minor improvements to a residential historic structure as an alternative to obtaining a variance that would otherwise be required. It is not the intent that this section be applied to relocated residential historic structures.
A. Repair, Maintain or Improve the Exterior of Listed Historic Residential Structures. When a residential historic structure is nonconforming because it exceeds the permitted height limit, or encroaches into one or more required setbacks, the following may be permitted with the approval of a historic rehabilitation permit: repair, replication or restoration of damaged nonconforming portions of the historic structure; and/or minor additions to the existing nonconforming portions of the structure. Additionally, when the proposed work on a residential historic structure exceeds sixty (60) percent of the current replacement value of the original structure and the need to bring nonconformities into compliance would normally be triggered; the maintenance of existing nonconformities may be authorized by a historic rehabilitation permit.
Work authorized by a historic rehabilitation permit approved under this section can maintain, but may not exacerbate, other existing nonconformities (e.g., floor area ratio, lot coverage). New additions must comply with all other provisions of this code. An illustrative, but not exhaustive, list of projects that may be approved by a historic rehabilitation permit is:
    1. Repair, restoration, replacement or rehabilitation of damaged exterior walls (including foundation work), porches, porch roofs and bay projections, provided these features are determined to be a historic element of the structure;
    2. Replication or restoration of lost or damaged historic architectural features and detailing that extend into a setback and/or exceed the height limit;
    3. New roof dormers in an existing roofline that exceeds the height limit. New roof dormers may not project above the existing ridgeline;
    4. Small infill additions between sections of a building that do not comply with the minimum setback. Proposed addition may not extend beyond the existing wall planes;
    5. New window and/or doorway openings in a building wall with a nonconforming setback.
B. Historic Rehabilitation Permit. 
    1. An application for historic rehabilitation permit shall be processed in accordance with the procedures provided under Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 18.64, Design Review, listed in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.19.040.
    2. A historic rehabilitation permit may be approved subject to the following additional findings:
        a. The granting of the application is desirable for the preservation, restoration or rehabilitation of the existing architectural style, and/or will allow an addition that better preserves the historic resource in a manner that could not otherwise be accomplished through the strict application of the regulations.
        b. The granting of the application is based on characteristics of the property and its improvements, and fulfills the purposes provided under Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.68.010. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 975 § 4, 2011)

18.68.040 Exception Permit.
A. Subject to the following application and procedures, the Planning Department staff shall grant an exception permit to allow changes to single-family nonconforming structures as specified by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.68.020.
B. Application and Fee. The application for an exception permit shall be made on forms provided by the City and authorized by the property owner(s). The fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
C. Required Information. 
    1. The required information shall be submitted on approved forms provided by the City.
    2. All plans shall be drawn to scale and accurately dimensioned. Floor plans shall be at a one-quarter inch equals one foot scale.
    3. Plans showing proposed and existing physical improvements and features shall show the following unless not relevant. The Planning Director may waive any of the submittal requirements:
        a. Site Plan. A site plan showing all existing structure(s) and property lines.
        b. Plans showing elevations and exterior materials for all sides of the building shall be prepared. The proposed and existing elevations to be changed shall be shown. Samples of materials shall be submitted when requested.
        c. Floor plans shall be submitted indicating the existing and proposed project.
D. Public Notice and Action. 
    1. Notification. If Planning Department staff determines that an exception permit should be approved and has made the necessary findings outlined herein, notices shall be sent to all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property using names and addresses appearing on the latest adopted assessor’s roll of the county, indicating that a permit will be issued for the project unless a written protest is received by the City within ten (10) days  of the date of the notice. City staff shall also post a notice on the property.
    2. Action. Projects to be acted upon by Planning Department staff may be approved; provided, that no written protests have been received within the ten-day time limit, subject to the findings listed below.
    3. Protests. In the event that a written protest is submitted to the City within the ten-day time limit, a public hearing shall be set before the Planning Commission.
E. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing that has been noticed pursuant to the provisions of Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.76.030 for projects that have been protested. The Planning Director may place an exception permit request on the Planning Commission agenda at his/her discretion. At this hearing, the Commission shall consider the testimony of the applicant and any interested parties and then, based upon the following findings, either approve, approve with conditions, continue, or deny the application.
F. Required Findings. The Planning Commission may grant an exception permit for nonconforming structures only if it is able to make the following findings:
    1. The exception will not increase the existing nonconformity.
    2. The proposed project otherwise conforms to the standards and regulations of this code.
    3. The proposed project will not be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare, comfort, or convenience of persons working or residing in the neighborhood of the proposed structure, nor be detrimental to the general welfare.
G. Appeal and Appeal Period. The decision of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Chapter 2.50. The Commission’s action will not be final until the appeal period has lapsed.
H. Revocation. The Planning Commission may hold a public hearing, noticed as required above, and revoke the exception permit if it finds that the conditions of the original approval have not been complied with.
I. Expiration. An exception permit or historic rehabilitation permit shall expire two (2) years after the effective date of approval.
J. Extension of Time. The applicant may apply to the Planning Director for a one-year extension of time to implement either the exception permit or historic rehabilitation permit prior to its expiration date, and the Director shall grant the extension if he or she determines that no significant changes to information regarding the condition of the property and/or the surrounding district have occurred since the original approval. An additional one-year extension of time shall require an application to the decision-making body. The applicant shall pay a fee for the extension hearing in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of processing, and the same criteria used by the Planning Director for granting the extension shall apply. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 975 § 4, 2011; Ord. 901 § 1 (part), 2000)

Repealed by Ord. 929. (Ord. 543 § 1, 1976; Ord. 295 § 210, 1962)

18.72.020 Application for Variance.
Applications for variance shall be made to the Planning Commission on forms provided, together with such other information as the Planning Commission may require and the required fee. A schedule of applicable fees shall be determined by resolution of the Council. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 295 § 211, 1962)

18.72.030 Notice of Hearing on Variance.
Upon receipt of an application, the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized officer or employee, shall:
A. Set the time and place for a public hearing thereon.
B. Cause notice of the hearing to be given by mail at least ten (10) days  prior to the date of the hearing to all the property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the exterior boundaries of the subject property using names and addresses appearing on the latest adopted tax roll of the county.
C. Notice of the hearing shall also be made to residents of the area by posting on the subject property and in the general area at visible and accessible locations. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 543 § 2, 1976; Ord. 295 § 212, 1962)

18.72.040 Hearing on Variance.
The Planning Commission shall, at the time set for the hearing, consider the application and shall hear protests against and objections to the requested variance and any and all other evidence which may be presented with respect thereto. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 295 § 213 (part), 1962)

18.72.045 Findings of Approval.
In consideration of the criteria set out below, the Planning Commission shall approve variances only when the following affirmative findings apply:
A. Because of special circumstances applicable to the property, strict application of this title would deprive the property owner of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under the identical zone classification.
B. The variance requested would not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property is situated.
C. The variance requested would not allow a use not otherwise expressly authorized by the zone regulation governing the property.
D. The granting of the variance, under the circumstances of the particular case, will not adversely affect the general health, safety, or welfare, or be detrimental to persons or property in the vicinity. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 929 § 70, 2004)

18.72.050 Consideration of Applications.
In reviewing applications, the Planning Commission must consider whether or not facts exist to render findings of approval based upon the following general criteria:
A. The special circumstances must be applicable to the property, not the particular circumstances of its owner or occupant, and may include its size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings.
B. The special circumstances must be the factor which causes the strict application of the zoning ordinance to deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in its vicinity and under identical zoning classification.
C. Self-created hardships may not be considered among the factors which might constitute special circumstances. A self-created hardship results from actions taken by present or recent users of the property which consciously create the very difficulties or hardships claimed as the basis for an application for a variance.
The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating the existence of any special circumstances. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 929 § 71, 2004; Ord. 543 § 3, 1976; Ord. 295 § 213 (part), 1962)

18.72.060 Action by Planning Commission.
A. Upon completion of the hearing, the Planning Commission may either approve, conditionally approve or deny the request. In approving any variance, the Planning Commission shall impose such conditions as will assure that the variance would not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located. The Planning Commission may impose any additional conditions it may deem necessary to ensure closer compliance with the objectives of this title. However, no condition may require the dedication of land for any purpose not reasonably related to the use of the property for which the variance is requested, nor the posting of a bond to guarantee installation of public improvements not reasonably related to the use of the property for which the variance is requested.
B. An approval shall indicate whether the variance is to attach to a specific use or whether it attaches to any use of the property as permitted by the governing zone regulation.
C. A complete record of each variance proceeding shall be maintained and shall be forwarded to the Council upon an appeal. The record of the hearing shall expressly set forth the findings of fact and the conclusions which support the decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a variance request. The Planning Commission shall deny the variance request if it is unable to make the findings or draw the conclusions which satisfy each of the criteria set out in Larkspur Municipal Code Section 18.72.045. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 543 § 4, 1976; Ord. 295 § 214, 1962)

18.72.070 Variance Application Approved – Issuance of Building Permit.
A. An application for variance approved by the Planning Commission shall become effective and a building permit shall be issued only after the expiration of the appeal time provided for in this title.
B. A variance approval will become null and void if unused within two (2) years from the effective date of the Planning Commission’s action, or final discretionary approval, or an alternative period specified by the approving body at the time of final discretionary approval. Such nonuse shall include, but not be limited to, failure to do one of the following:
    1. Secure a building permit and commence construction, where the variance was required to build a new structure or alter an existing structure; or
    2. Receive a license or permit to operate from the City, which license or permit would not have been approved without the variance; or
    3. Record a subdivision map or parcel map, which map would not have been approved by the City without the variance.
C. The applicant may apply to the Planning Director for a one-year extension of time to implement a variance prior to its expiration date, and the Director shall grant the extension if he or she determines that no significant changes to information regarding the condition of the property and/or the surrounding district have occurred since the original approval. An additional one-year extension of time shall require an application to the Planning Commission, and shall be considered at a duly noticed public hearing. The applicant shall pay a fee for the extension hearing in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of processing, and the same criteria used by the Planning Director for granting the extension shall apply. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 953 § 1(81), 2007; Ord. 639 § 1, 1981; Ord. 543 § 5, 1976; Ord. 295 § 215(A), 1962)

18.72.080 Revocation of Noncomplying Variance.
Any variance approved by the Planning Commission may be revoked for noncompliance with any of the conditions specified by the Planning Commission in the approval of the variance. A hearing shall be held before the Planning Commission for consideration of such revocation, and the property owner shall be given notice by mail of the hearing at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the day of the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall also be posted on the subject property at a visible and accessible location. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 543 § 6, 1976; Ord. 295 § 215(B), 1962)

18.72.090 New Application1.
Following the denial of a variance application or the revocation of an approved variance, no further application for the same or substantially the same variance on the same or substantially the same lot shall be filed within six (6) months of the date of the denial or revocation of the variance, unless the denial or revocation is made without prejudice. If the denial or revocation is made without prejudice, an application may be resubmitted at any time. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 809 § 1, 1990; Ord. 543 § 7, 1976; Ord. 295 § 215(C), 1962)

(Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 857 § 16, 1993; Ord. 543 § 10, 1976; Ord. 295 § 224(A), 1962)

18.76.070 Use Permit Application Approval – Issuance of a Building Permit.
A. Upon approval of the use permit application, the permit will become effective and a building permit may be issued only after the expiration of the appeal time provided for in this title. A use permit will become null and void if it is unused within two (2) years from the effective date of the Planning Commission’s action, or final discretionary approval, or an alternative period specified by the approving body at the time of final discretionary approval. Where the use permit authorizes construction of a new structure or an addition to an existing structure, the failure to secure a building permit and commence construction within the two-year period shall be deemed to be such nonuse.
B. The applicant may apply to the Planning Director for a one-year extension of time to implement a use permit prior to its expiration date, and the Director shall grant the extension if he or she determines that no significant changes to information regarding the condition of the property and/or the surrounding district have occurred since the original approval. An additional one-year extension of time shall require an application to the Planning Commission, and shall be considered at a duly noticed public hearing. The applicant shall pay a fee for the extension hearing in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of processing, and the same criteria used by the Planning Director for granting the extension shall apply.

Any use permit approved by the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator may be revoked for noncompliance with any of the conditions specified by the Planning Commission in the approval of the use permit. A hearing shall be held before the Planning Commission for consideration of such revocation, and the property owner shall be given notice by mail of the hearing at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the day of the hearing.
Notice of the hearing shall also be posted on the subject property at a visible and accessible location. (Ord. 1030 § 2(12), 2018; Ord. 857 § 18, 1993; Ord. 543 § 11 (part), 1976; Ord. 441 § 1, 1972; Ord. 295 § 225(A), 1962)

18.76.090 Applicability to Specific and Continued Use.
Any granted use permit shall apply to the specific use and continue in effect, regardless of ownership, so long as no change is made in the use. In the event that the approved use becomes discontinued for a period of one hundred fifty (150) days or longer during any period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, the use permit shall be automatically revoked.

The City Council of the City of Larkspur does hereby find and declare all of the following:
A. The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and general welfare, rather than to punish;

A. Any recipient of a notice of violation enforceable by administrative penalties under this chapter may request an appeal hearing to contest there was a violation, as specified in the notice of violation, or that he or she is responsible for said violation, by completing a “request for hearing form” and returning it to the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice of violation. At the time of returning the request for hearing form to the City Clerk, the person or entity requesting the appeal hearing shall pay an appeal processing fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Failure to pay the appeal processing fee, or make arrangements for the payment of the fee, may result in the hearing being postponed until the payment of such fee.
B. Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be set for a date not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date that the request for hearing form is filed in accordance with this chapter, unless the matter is urgent or good cause exists for an extension of time, in which case the date for such hearing may be shortened, or extended, as warranted by the circumstances.
C. Any hearing provided under this section shall provide a full opportunity for the person or persons subject to a notice of violation to appear and contest the determination that a violation has occurred and/or that the violation continues to exist. If the appeal hearing involves a juvenile, such a hearing shall be private and confidential unless the juvenile’s parents/guardians specifically request that the hearing be public. The failure of any interested party to appear at a requested appeals hearing shall constitute a failure by such party to exhaust his/her/their administrative remedies, and a waiver of the same.
D. At the place and time set forth in the notice of hearing, the Hearing Officer shall conduct a hearing on the notice of violation. The Hearing Officer shall consider any written or oral evidence regarding the violation that may be presented by the violator, real property owner, any officer or agent of the Authority and/or City, and any other interested party.
E. After receiving all of the evidence presented, the public testimony portion of the hearing shall be closed. The Hearing Officer may then consider what action, or actions, if any, should be taken, including the imposition of any fines or penalties.
F. Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue written findings and make a determination regarding the existence of the violation. If the Hearing Officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation occurred, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written finding of those facts. The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be final.
G. The recipient or recipients of a notice of violation shall be served with a copy of the decision of the Hearing Officer, including an administrative order if one is issued, in the manner and method set forth by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 19.01.050(C). (Ord. 1031, 2018; Ord. 1030 § 2(13), 2018; Ord. 1007 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1002 §§ 2, 3, 2015)

19.01.070 Administrative Order.
If the Hearing Officer determines that a violation occurred as set forth by the notice of violation, the Hearing Officer shall issue an administrative order.
A. An administrative order may impose an administrative fine in the applicable amount set forth by Larkspur Municipal Code Section 19.01.040(D) per violation, or, in the alternative, a number of hours of community service as determined by the Hearing Officer. The denial of community service by the Hearing Officer may not be appealed under Government Code Section 53069.4.
B. Any appeal processing fee that is paid pursuant to Larkspur Municipal Code Section 19.01.060(A) shall be refunded to the payee if it is determined, after a hearing, that the person charged in the notice of violation was not responsible for the violation or that there was no violation as charged in said notice. (Ord. 1031, 2018; Ord. 1030 § 2(13), 2018; Ord. 1007 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1002 §§ 2, 3, 2015)

19.01.080 Collections and Lien Proceedings.
A. Any administrative fine or penalty in the amount set forth by the notice of violation, if an appeal is not requested in a timely manner, or as ordered by the Hearing Officer, if the matter is timely appealed, shall be paid to the City within thirty (30) days of service of the notice of violation or administrative order, unless an extension of time is requested by the violator and granted by the City.
B. Payment of a fine or penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not excuse or permit any continuation or repeated occurrence of the violation that is the subject of the notice of violation.
C. Any administrative penalty or fines imposed within the notice of violation, if no timely appeal is made, or ordered by the Hearing Officer, if the matter is appealed, are a debt owed to the City. In addition to all other means of enforcement, any fines or penalties specified in the notice of violation, if no timely appeal is made, or specified in the administrative order of the Hearing Officer, may be enforced as a personal obligation of the violator.
D. If the violation is connected with real property and the violator is an owner of the real property, any fines or penalties may be enforced by imposition of a lien on the real property. The Police Department shall prepare and file with the City Clerk a report stating the amount due and owing. The City may record notice of this lien after a hearing before the City Council to consider any protest or objection to the lien. The City shall serve notice of the hearing upon the owner of record of the real property, based on the last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current. The notice of hearing shall include the time, date, and place of the hearing and the amount of the lien to be imposed, and shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. If the owner of record cannot be found after a diligent search, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days  and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in Marin County, California. If the City Council determines that the lien should be imposed, the City may cause notice of the lien to be recorded with the County Recorder. Once recorded, the lien shall have the force and effect and priority of a judgment lien. Any fee imposed on the City by the County Recorder for costs of processing and recording the lien and the cost of providing notice to the property owner in the manner described herein may be recovered from the property owner in any foreclosure action to enforce the lien after recordation.
E. The remedies set forth in this section are not exclusive. The City may collect administrative penalties and fines by the use of the small claims court or by any other legal remedy. (Ord. 1031, 2018; Ord. 1030 § 2(13), 2018; Ord. 1007 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1002 §§ 2, 3, 2015)

19.01.090 Judicial Review.
Any person aggrieved by an administrative fine determination of the Hearing Officer may obtain review of that decision by filing a petition for review in the Marin County Superior Court, in accordance with Government Code Section 53069.4. (Ord. 1031, 2018; Ord. 1030 § 2(13), 2018; Ord. 1007 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1002 §§ 2, 3, 2015; Ord. 961 § 1 (part), 2008. Formerly 9.56.050)

19.01.100 Supplementary Enforcement Authority.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the City from initiating a civil or administrative action, or any other legal or equitable proceeding, to obtain compliance or to discourage noncompliance with the provisions of this code. The enforcement procedures described by this chapter are intended to be alternative methods of obtaining compliance and/or discouraging noncompliance with the provisions of this code and are expressly intended to be in addition to any other remedies provided by law. It is the intent of the City Council that the immunities prescribed in Penal Code Section 836.5 shall be applicable to personnel of the Police Department and of the City acting in the course and scope of employment pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 1031, 2018; Ord. 1030 § 2(13), 2018; Ord. 1007 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1002 §§ 2, 3, 2015; Ord. 961 § 1 (part), 2008. Formerly 9.56.060)
