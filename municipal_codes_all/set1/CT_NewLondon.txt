Notes to the Code 
    Please note that some references in the New London Code may not be consistent with recent or pending revisions in reporting authority responsibilities now under control of vendor agencies. 
    Some of these changes include: 
DIRECTOR OF HEALTH-Health codes are now enforced by The Ledge Light Health District, in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes. 
WATER/SEWER DEPARTMENT-Some aspects of the water authority are under the control of the City Council and Water/Water Pollution Control Authority approved vendor. 
OCEAN BEACH PARK BOARD-A contracted vendor operates Ocean Beach Park. Regulations are enforced by various agencies, including New London Police Department, Ledge Light Health District and other municipal authorities. 
NOTICE OF TERM CHANGE 
Change from City Manager to Chief Executive Officer 
    On November 8, 2011 the voters of the City of New London will elect a new form of government. There are many references to the "city manager" in the New London Code of Ordinances. Many of these references are being addressed by nature of a blanket ordinance, passed by the City Council on June 6, 2011. This ordinance was created to ensure that the codes would not be inconsistent with the change of government in references to the city manager. 
    Over 100 sections of the municipal codes will be impacted. Some sections will require nothing more than the simple exchange of title references. Others become complex as adjustments to board or agency membership or specific administrative responsibilities of the newly elected chief executive officer and staff are adjusted. 
    Listed below are the code sections immediately impacted with the upcoming change, which will be made without a specific revision to the codebook being published, at this time.

PREFACE 
  
  
    This publication is a reprinting and updating of the Code of Ordinances for the City of New London, Connecticut. It contains ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature as adopted by the Council of the City of New London in 1977 and contains subsequent revisions and amendments thereto. 
    Please note that the New London City Charter is no longer included within this publication and is available as a stand alone document from the Department of the City Clerk. 
    You will find some ordinances dating back many years in need of updating or elimination. Department heads should refer such proposed revisions to the City Council for review and possible action. Many new and revised ordinances are also included. In the future new ordinances and revisions to existing ordinances will be published on a routine basis and distributed by Municipal Code Corporation to all code book holders of record. Additional copies will be available directly from Municipal Code Corporation. 
    The codes have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and updated as directed by the New London City Council and the City Manager. 
    The publisher has prepared the index with great care. Items may appear under several headings, presented in lay language, phraseology and in legal terminology. 
    The successful maintenance of any code depends on the maintenance of the revisions by the code holder. Please insert revised pages as you receive them. You may wish to remove and retain deleted pages for historical reference. 
    The editor thanks Municipal Code Corporation, City Council, City Manager and Department Heads for their input during the reprinting process.

    The council shall appoint a board of compensation of three members who shall serve at the pleasure of the council. Members of the council shall not be appointed to the board of compensation, but officers in the administrative service of the city, other than the mayor, may be so appointed. Persons holding any other office under the city shall receive no compensation for service on such board, but members thereof holding no other office under the city shall receive such compensation as may be fixed by ordinance. The board shall choose one of its members to be president and may determine its own rules of procedure, except as such rules may be established by ordinance. A vote of a majority of the members of the board shall determine the action thereof in all matters. 
Sec. 97. - Resolution of intention; report by mayor. 
    Before proceeding to take any land for public use, lay out, widen, extend, exchange or discontinue any street, public way, place or park, establish any wharf, dock, landing place or building line, or to lay or construct any sewer or surface drain, or to take any land or interest in land therefor, or to take any lands or interest therein within the limits of said city for the purposes of the city's water supply, or make any public improvement for which benefits or damages may be assessed against, or in favor of property affected thereby, the council shall first declare by resolution its intention so to do. Any such resolution shall give a general description of the action contemplated and shall direct the mayor to have a report prepared thereon. The report so prepared shall include all necessary surveys, plans, profiles and specifications; estimates of the total cost of any such action, work or improvement; estimates of the value of any land proposed to be taken; and estimates of the amount of benefit or damage which should be assessed against or in favor of any property affected. A copy of the report shall, when completed, be placed on file for public inspection in such office of the city as the mayor may designate. When any portion of the cost of a public work or improvement is to be assessed against property benefitted thereby, the resolution of the council shall so declare and indicate the portion of such cost to be so assessed. 
Sec. 98. - Notice of contemplated action. 
    Upon the completion of the report, as provided in the foregoing section, notice thereof and of the contemplated action of the council shall be given to all parties in interest, by publication not less than three times in at least one daily newspaper of general circulation in the city to be designated by the council. Such notice shall be addressed to all persons interested in lands which would be affected by the proposed action, naming each person known to be so interested, and shall specify a time and place when such persons may appear before the board of compensation and be heard respecting the price of any land proposed to be taken, or any assessment of benefits or damages, as set forth in the report prepared under the direction of the mayor. The meeting of the board of compensation pursuant to any such notice shall not be sooner than one week after the last publication thereof as provided in this section. 
Sec. 99. - Hearings; report of board of compensation. 
    The board of compensation shall meet at the time and place specified in such notice, and may continue to meet by adjournment to such time and place as it may deem proper until all parties in interest, as named in the notice, shall have had a reasonable opportunity to be heard. After such hearings, which shall be based on the report prepared under the direction of the mayor, the board of compensation shall report its recommendations to the council. Such report shall indicate the amount which, in the judgment of the board, should be paid for any land proposed to be taken, the probable cost of making any public improvement or of taking any other action indicated in the published notice as contemplated by the council, and shall assess benefits and damages against or in favor of property which would be affected by such improvement or action, if benefits are to be assessed and if there will be any damages. The report of the board of compensation to the council shall be in writing and shall have annexed thereto a survey showing the particular designation of any land proposed to be taken and the layout of any work or improvement contemplated. 
Sec. 100. - Assessing properties benefited. 
    In assessing benefits the board, of compensation shall assess upon and against each owner of property benefited the amount of his due proportion of the whole cost of such work, improvement or action, including both damages and the estimated cost of construction. If the council shall have ordered the assessment upon properties benefited of only a part of such whole cost, the board of compensation shall assess upon each such owner his due proportion of such part. 
Sec. 101. - Council action by ordinance. 
    The council may accept as submitted, modify or reject a report made by the board of compensation. If, after receiving any such report, the council determines to proceed with the action, work or improvement described therein, it shall pass an ordinance directing that such action, work or improvement be carried out in accordance with the report as finally approved by the council, and the report so approved shall be recorded in the land records of the Town of New London. Upon the passage of such ordinance and the recording of the report, each and all actions, improvements and work provided for therein shall be deemed duly and legally authorized, and all assessments of benefits and damages so provided for shall be deemed duly and legally made. 
Sec. 102. - Notice of assessments. 
    Immediately after the passage of the ordinance and the recording of the report, as provided in section one hundred one of this act, the city clerk shall cause a notice to be published containing a list of all persons whose land may have been taken, or against or in favor of whom benefits or damages may have been assessed, with the amount to be paid to or by each such person in accordance with such ordinance and report. The notice shall order the payment to the city of all benefits assessed and shall indicate a time and place fixed by the council, at which the city will make payment for any land taken or damage assessed. Such notice shall be published once each week for four consecutive weeks in at least one daily newspaper of general circulation in the city to be designated by the council, and the city clerk shall, within ten days after the passage of such ordinance, mail, postage paid, a copy thereof to each person named therein. In case of estates of deceased persons in process of settlement such notice mailed to the executor or administrator thereof shall be deemed notice to the owner. Upon the completion of such publication each such assessment of benefits shall become a debt to the city and shall bear legal interest from the time when it becomes due and payable. After the publication of notice as aforesaid, the city may, except as hereinafter provided, enter upon any land taken, or do and complete any action, work or improvement in accordance with such ordinance and report. 
Sec. 103. - Application to court by parties aggrieved by assessments. 
    Any party in interest aggrieved by the price fixed for any land to be taken, or by any assessment of benefits or damages, may make written application for relief to the superior court, provided that he shall have filed a copy of such application with the city clerk within thirty days after the first publication of the notice provided for in section one hundred two of this act. No such application shall operate to vacate any appraisal, assessment or lien based thereon, but the same shall stand until modified or revised by the court. The court may, by committee or otherwise, inquire into the allegations of such application and may confirm, modify or annul the appraisal, assessment or action complained of, or make such order in the premises as equity may require. The court may, at its discretion, allow costs to either party. All such appeals shall be privileged cases in the superior court and the director of law shall cause them to be heard as speedily as possible. 
Sec. 104. - Taking of land after filing of security. 
    No land taken as aforesaid shall be occupied by the city until the time for taking appeals shall have expired, and until all appeals shall have been finally disposed of, unless the city shall file an offer to give such security as the court may require for the payment of all damages which may finally be awarded to the appellant, and the court, or any judge thereof in vacation, after hearing the parties, upon such notice as the court or judge may deem sufficient, shall fix the security to be given by the city. When security shall have been given as aforesaid, the city may immediately enter upon, take possession of, and use such land for the purpose or purposes for which it was taken. 
Sec. 105. - Assessment of damages versus benefits. 
    If an assessment of damages be made in favor of any person and an assessment of benefits also be made against such person, the difference between such assessment of damages and benefits shall be paid by him to the city, or by the city to him, as the case may be, and he shall be deemed to have received just compensation for all his damages. If an assessment of benefits be made against any person and no assessment of damages be made in his favor he shall pay to the city the amount of benefits assessed. If the assessment of damages made in favor of any person and benefits made against such person be equal, he shall be deemed to have received just compensation for all his damages. If any person shall refuse to receive the amount due him for any property taken or damages assessed, or if no one be found in this state having authority to receive the amount due any such person, such amount shall be deposited in the city treasury to be paid to the person entitled to receive it when he shall apply therefor. 
Sec. 106. - Assessment of benefits lien on property. 
    Assessment of benefits, made as provided in this act, shall be and remain liens or incumbrances upon the land or other properties upon which they are made, and shall take precedence of all other liens or incumbrances, except taxes due the state and other prior public liens. Any such lien shall be liable to be foreclosed in the same manner as if it were a mortgage on such lands and buildings in favor of the city to secure the amount of the assessment. Such liens shall not continue to exist for a period longer than ninety days after the assessment becomes due and payable, unless within that period a certificate signed by the clerk of the city describing the premises on which such lien exists, the work or improvement on account of which it is claimed, and the amount claimed by the city as the lien thereon, shall be filed for record with the town clerk of New London. And any such lien shall cease to exist whenever a certificate discharging the same, signed by the director of finance, shall be filed for record with the town clerk. All such certificates shall be recorded by the town clerk upon the land records of the Town of New London, and the legal fees for filing, recording and releasing such liens shall be added to the assessment. 
Sec. 106a. - Abatement or waiver of interest due. 
    The council of the City of New London may, by resolution or ordinance, provide for the abatement or waiver of interest due to said city upon any debt to the city arising out of the assessment of benefits for any public sewer, when such interest shall accrue prior to the completion of such sewer.

Sec. 108. - Expense of constructing or repairing curbs and sidewalks.

Sec. 109. - Water and sewer assessments. 
    In addition to supplying its inhabitants with water the city may contract to supply water to persons outside the city limits and may fix the rate to be charged for such service, provided such rate shall not be less than the rate charged to inhabitants of the City of New London. All rates due for water supplied to properties outside the limits of said city shall be and remain a lien upon the houses, tenements or lot wherein or in connection with which said water shall have been used by the owner or occupier thereof, which liens shall have priority over all subsequent incumbrances, and may be enforced and foreclosed by and in the name of said city in a court of competent jurisdiction in the same manner as liens of mechanics on lands and buildings are now foreclosed according to the rules of equity; provided said liens shall not be perfected unless said city shall, within ninety days after said water rates become due, lodge with the town clerk of the town wherein such tenement, lot or house is situated, a certificate in writing, sworn to by the director of finance of said city, of the amount due as near as the same can be ascertained, and a general description of the premises holden; and provided the water shall not be introduced into any building or premises occupied by a tenant, without the consent of the owner or owners thereof first obtained in writing. All moneys received for water rates shall be paid into the city treasury. All moneys received for sewer assessments shall be paid into the city treasury.

Sec. 2-66. - Purpose and definitions. 
    The city procures for general government and the board of education contract services, professional services, public works improvement/construction projects, supplies and materials, and capital equipment in the conduct of its business. Contract services are journeyman type functions producing a task, project or service such as plumbing, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other maintenance activity. Professional services include administrative, medical, legal, technical, architectural, engineering and appraisal expertise. Public works improvement/construction projects are executed by contract or city force account or combination having value of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or more resulting in a new or substantially improved facility or infrastructure item; such projects do not include maintenance or utility repairs. Supplies and materials include office supplies, operating repair, maintenance supplies, small tools and minor equipment. Capital equipment is a fixed asset with a life expectancy of two (2) years or more, and in most instances having a value of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more. The most stringent standards of the code of ethics of the city, or rules and/or regulations of the state or national government will prevail depending on the source of funds, in all situations of purchase or disposal. Where that source is exclusively city funds then the city's code of ethics shall be the governing regulations. Where the source is state funds (either in whole or in part) then state regulations should prevail. Where the source is national government (in whole or in part) then the purchase and disposal should be governed by the regulations found at 24 CFR 570.6l 1 and 24 CFR 85.35, as amended from time to time. Rules and regulations are prescribed in an effort to secure quality, at the lowest expense, and without benefiting either the supplier or any city agent in either a personal or financial way which would cause a conflict of interest. It shall be the duty of the chief executive officer to promulgate and ensure the enforcement of rules and regulations pertaining to ethics and procurement procedures of the city, state and national government.

The chief executive officer shall execute all contracts in excess of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00); cognizant department heads shall execute all other contracts. No contract may be executed unless a valid encumbrance exists therefore. The chief executive officer may, without submitting bids to the council, reject same and cause the purchasing agent to solicit new bids.

The HDC/DRB shall review the demolition application at its next regularly scheduled monthly meeting, provided the application is filed at least fifteen (15) days before the meeting. Otherwise the demolition permit application will be reviewed at the HDC/DRB's following regularly scheduled meeting. The HDC/DRB may ask the applicant to attend the meeting in order to ask the applicant questions, and members of the public may also attend the meeting and voice their opinions and concerns about the proposed demolition and to consider alternatives. 
(7)  The HDC/DRB finding. The purpose of the HDC/DRB's review of the application is to determine whether or not the subject building or structure has historic or cultural value based on the following criteria:

1)  If the HDC/DRB finds that the building or structure has historic or cultural value, the building official shall delay issuance of the demolition permit for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of receipt of the completed application. This will provide the HDC/DRB or other interested parties with an opportunity to seek possible alternatives to the demolition. 
2)  If the HDC/DRB finds that the building does not have historic or cultural value, the building official may issue the demolition permit without a further waiting period. 
(9)  Failure to report.

(Ord. of 5-9-77, § 1) 
Sec. 6-42. - Applicability; map adopted. 
    This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the City of New London. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator through a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of New London," dated May, 1976, with accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and any revision thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The FIRM designations for areas of special flood hazard in the City of New London are A8 and V8 zones. The base flood (100-year flood) elevation for these zones is eleven (11) feet m.s.l.

(e)  New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the building official prior to the issuance of a building permit for such structure. 
(f)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards the building official shall make the necessary interpretation.

(a)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide. 
(b)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be elevated so that the lowest supporting member is located no lower than the base flood elevation level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open so as not to impede the flow of water, except for breakaway walls as provided for in subsection (h), below. 
(c)  All new construction or substantial improvement shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns. 
(d)  Pilings or columns used as structural support shall be designed and anchored so as to withstand all applied loads of the base flood flow and the applicant shall obtain certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that the structure is securely anchored to adequately anchored pilings or columns in order to withstand velocity waters and hurricane wave wash. 
(e)  Compliance with provisions contained in subsections (b), (c) and (d), above, shall be certified to by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
(f)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. 
(g)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage. 
(h)  Breakaway walls for new construction or substantial improvements shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are to be used. 
(i)  If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation. 
(j)  Prior to construction, plans for any structure that will have breakaway walls must be submitted to the building official for approval.

(a)  Variances shall be issued only upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  Variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(c)  The board shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of the building official that (i) the issuance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
(d)  The board shall (i) maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such variances issued in its annual report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
(Ord. of 5-9-77, § 8)

For the purposes of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

B.  Within twelve (12) months from the expiration of the final period for the uncontested payment of any fine, penalty, cost or fee levied as the result of a violation of any provision of the City Code or any other regulation adopted as subject to citation by the city council, notice shall be sent to the violator, the owner of the property which is the subject of the violation in question, or such other person as may be appropriate. Such notice shall inform the owner and/or other person: 
(1)  That a warning for the cited violation had been properly issued; 
(2)  Of the allegations of the citation and the amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees due; 
(3)  Of the right to contest liability at a hearing before a citation hearing officer by delivering, in person or by mail, written notice of such intent within ten (10) days of the date thereof; 
(4)  That a failure to request such hearing will result in the prompt entry of an assessment and judgment against the person or persons named in the citation; 
(5)  That such judgment may issue without further notice; and 
(6)  That failure to respond to this notice of violation shall result in the issuance of an infraction citation to the violator. 
C.  Admission of liability. 
(1)  If any person who is sent notice pursuant to subsection B of this section wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation, that person may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted to in person or by mail at the address specified in the notice. Such payment shall be inadmissible in any proceedings, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other person making the payment. 
(2)  Any person who does not respond to the notice provided in subsection B of this section by paying the fines and penalties set forth therein or by requesting a hearing within ten (10) days thereafter may be issued an infraction citation by a duly authorized individual based upon the original municipal ordinance violation and said person shall be deemed to have admitted liability. The designated municipal official shall certify such person's failure to respond to the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs, or fees provided for by the applicable ordinances. 
D.  Hearing procedure. 
(1)  Any person who requests a hearing pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall be given written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing. Hearings shall be during normal business hours. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of the notice, provided that the hearing officer shall grant, upon good cause shown, any reasonable request by an interested party for postponement or continuance. The hearing officer may accept from any person contesting liability copies of police reports, investigation and citation reports and other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person at a hearing is unnecessary. If the person or persons cited otherwise fail to appear, the hearing officer shall enter an assessment by default against them upon a finding of: 
(a)  Proper notice. 
(b)  Liability under the applicable provision of the ordinances. 
(2)  An original or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the issuing official or police officer shall be filed and retained by the municipality and shall be deemed to be a business record and evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the issuing official or police officer shall be required at the hearing if any interested party so requests. 
(3)  A person wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing, unless excused from so doing by the hearing officer, and may present evidence. The defendant has the right to request the presence of the issuing citation officer. The issuing officer, corporation counsel or his designee may present evidence on behalf of the city but the presence of corporation council is not required. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof, as that officer deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. 
(4)  The hearing officer shall announce the decision at the end of the hearing. If the hearing officer determines that the person is not liable, the matter shall be dismissed and the determination entered in writing accordingly. If the hearing officer determines that the person is liable for the violation, the appropriate fines, penalties, costs or fees shall promptly be entered and assessed against such person as provided by the applicable ordinances. The hearing officer shall have the authority to modify the violation or reduce the penalty and/or fee assessable against any person if, in the hearing officer's discretion, such modification is warranted based upon the facts elicited during the hearing process. 
(5)  If any hearing officer has entered an assessment by default against any person with respect to any matter, no hearing officer shall reconsider that matter until the person against whom such assessment has been imposed has submitted a written request to open said assessment by default explaining the basis for the person's failure to appear at the scheduled hearing and paid a nonrefundable fee for said request in the amount of ten dollars ($10) to the city; and said request has been considered on its merits and granted by a hearing officer. The decision to grant or deny such a request shall rest in the sole discretion of the hearing officer. 
E.  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer or the issuing citation officer shall send by first class mail, postage prepaid, a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than thirty (30) days nor more than twelve (12) months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment against such person in favor of the municipality with the clerk of a superior court facility designated by the chief court administrator within the boundaries of the judicial district of New London, together with such entry fee as may be required by the superior court. Notwithstanding any other provisions, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment, and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such person. Said judgments may be referred to the city attorney for collection actions. 
F.  Should a civil money judgment and levy of execution on such judgment be sought and awarded, municipal officials and department heads, having regulatory cognizance and the authority to collect fees, issue licenses, and permits may deny applications and withhold said licenses and permits for unpaid judgments. Licenses and permits shall include business licenses, licenses in general, building, zoning, and special use permits, and certificates of occupancies, where required by city ordinance. Said licenses and permits shall not be suspended or revoked. Only the renewal or issuance may be withheld until such time as the civil money judgment is paid to the treasurer of the city. 
This provision of this section may be executed when the violation occurred on property where certificate of occupancies, business licenses, building permits, zoning permits, and special use permits are required by ordinance. 
G.  A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An appeal shall be instituted within thirty (30) days of the mailing of notice of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with such entry fee as may be required by the superior court, in the superior court for the geographical area 10, which shall entitle such person to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges of the superior court.

ARTICLE VII. - CODE OF ETHICS[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 06-20-11-1, § 1, adopted June 20, 2011, amended article VII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article VII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an amendment of April 17, 1995. 

Sec. 15-201. - Policy. 
(a)  The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed. 
(b)  People have a fundamental right to expect that public officials and employees will conduct themselves in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government they represent. 
(c)  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the government structure; and that public office not be used for personal gain. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials and employees is hereby adopted. The purpose of this code is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing such disclosure by these officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. This process must be free from threats, favoritism, undue influence and all forms of impropriety so the confidence of the public is not eroded. 
(Ord. No. 06-20-11-1, § 1, 6-20-11) 
Sec. 15-202. - Definitions. 
    [As used in this article, the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed thereto:] 
    Agency means and includes the city council, the board of education and all other agencies, authorities, boards, commissions, committees, departments, and offices of the city without exception. 
    Confidential information means any information which is not available to the general public under the Connecticut General Statutes and which is obtained only by reason of an official's or employee's position. 
    Financial interest means any interest which will result in a direct or indirect pecuniary benefit accruing to a public officer, employee, spouse, or any member of his or her immediate family as a result of a contract or transaction which is or may be the subject of an official act or action by or with the city except for such contracts or transactions which by their terms and by the substance of their provisions confer the opportunity and right to realize the accrual of similar benefits to all persons and/or property similarly situated. 
    Immediate family means spouse, domestic partner, child or step child, sibling or step-sibling, parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law. 
    Notice means posting of certified or registered mail to last known address, or delivery of written notice in person. 
    Official or employee means any person elected or appointed to, or employed or retained by, any public office or public body of the city whether paid or unpaid and whether part-time or full-time. 
    Personal interest means any interest other than financial which would affect the action of the official or employee except if that interest is based solely on the responsibility of his/her city office or employment. Membership in or affiliation with a social, fraternal, charitable, service, educational, religious, governmental or similar non-profit organization is not deemed to automatically create a presumption of personal interest unless the official employee is also an official or employee of the organization. 
    Probable cause is defined by determining whether facts would warrant a reasonable person to believe that an elected municipal official or a municipal employee violated this code. The belief should be more than a mere suspicion, but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    Public body means any agency, board, body, commission, committee, department, or office of the city. 
    Respondent is any person accused of violating this code. 
(Ord. No. 06-20-11-1, § 1, 6-20-11)

(a)  Officials and employees have an obligation to act morally and honestly in discharging their responsibilities. 
(b)  Officials and employees shall conduct themselves with propriety, discharge their duties impartially and fairly and make continuing efforts toward attaining and maintaining high standards of conduct. 
(c)  Each official serving on a multi-member agency is expected to devote the time, and effort necessary to the successful functioning of such body. 
(d)  No official or employee shall, for any reason, use or attempt to use his/her position to influence improperly any other official or employee, or any contractor doing business with the city, in the performance of his/her official duties. 
(Ord. No. 06-20-11-1, § 1, 6-20-11) 
Sec. 15-205. - Use of resources. 
    No official or employee shall use or permit the use of city owned material or city personnel in any manner prohibited by state statute, city ordinance, or administrative regulation. City owned property and city personnel may be used only for the conduct of official business except where such resources are available to the public generally.

Sec. 15-206. - Treatment of the public.

Each member of the public shall be treated courteously, impartially, and fairly, the relationship between city officials and employees and the public is recognized to be one which requires cooperation and mutual respect. It is therefore urged that the public conduct itself with the same propriety and consideration expected of city officials and employees.

An official or employee having such a financial or personal interest shall not engage in deliberations concerning the matter, shall disqualify himself from acting on the matter and shall not communicate about such matter with any person who will participate in the action to be taken on such matter. No public employee or official may use his/her position or office for the financial benefit of himself, a business with which he/she is associated, or a member of his/her immediate family. 
(c)  No official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall represent or appear on behalf of any individual or entity before any agency of the city, or take any appellate proceedings from any action of such agency, either personally or through an associate or partner, against the interest of the city or any of its agencies in any action or proceeding unless it is sufficiently remote from his/her official duties that no actual conflict of interest exists. 
(d)  No official or employee whether paid or unpaid, shall represent or appear on behalf of any individual or entity before an agency of the city, either personally or through an associate or partner, unless there is first disclosure to that agency of his/her status as an employee or official, and unless the matter is sufficiently remote from his/her official duties that no conflict of interest exists and the officer or employee is not in a position to exert improper influence. 
(e)  Nothing herein shall be interpreted or construed to prohibit any official or employee from exercising his/her legal rights as to his/her own personal interests in processing a claim against or request to the city or any of its agencies, or in defending a claim made against him/her by the city or any of its agencies, or to prohibit an official or employee from testifying as a witness in any administrative or judicial proceeding.

Nothing in the preceding shall prevent public employees or public officials from receiving necessary and appropriate expenses.

    No paid consultant may represent anyone other than the municipality concerning any matter in which he/she participated personally and substantially as a consultant to the municipality. 
    No paid consultant shall disclose confidential information learned while performing his/her duties for the city nor shall he/she use such information for the financial interests of himself/herself or others.

(b)  Any person who owns a real property in the City of New London or is liable for the payment of taxes thereon, pursuant to G.S. § 12-48, and who occupies the property as a principal residence shall be entitled to a credit of up to $200.00 on the real estate tax bill, provided the following conditions are complied with:

(3)  Shall be under age 65 and eligible in accordance with applicable federal regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits under social security, or has not been engaged in employment covered by social security and accordingly has not qualified for benefits thereunder but has become qualified for permanent total disability benefits under any federal, state, or local government retirement or disability plan, including the Railroad Retirement Act and any government-related teacher's retirement plan, in which requirements with respect to qualifications for such permanent total disability benefits are comparable to such requirements under social security.

(5)  Applications must be filed with the assessor's office between February 1 and May 15 in the year following the list year with respect to which benefits are claimed, and a photocopy of the state form will be used.

(6)  The same income guidelines as used by the State of Connecticut application for tax credits for elderly homeowners and totally disabled persons will be used. 
(7)  No tax credits shall be given under this section to any person who owes delinquent taxes to the City of New London. The applicant shall submit a certificate from the tax collector to the effect that no such delinquent taxes are owed. 
(8)  No property tax relief authorized hereunder together with any relief received by any such resident under provisions of G.S. § 12-129b-12-129d, inclusive, G.S. § 12-129h and 12-170aa shall exceed, in the aggregate the total amount of the tax which would, except for said G.S.§12-129b-12-129d, inclusive, G.S. § 12-129h and 12-170aa and this section, be laid against the taxpayer.

(d)  The assessor shall determine whether each applying taxpayer is entitled to tax credit under this section and shall compute the amount of tax credit to which each qualified taxpayer is entitled and cause a certificate of tax credit to be issued in such form as to permit the tax collector to reduce the amount of tax levied against the taxpayer. 
(e)  Only one tax credit shall be allowed for each parcel of land eligible for the tax credit under this section. In any case where title to such real property is recorded in the name of the taxpayer or his or her spouse, who are eligible for tax credit, and any other person or persons, the amount shall be prorated to allow a tax credit equivalent to the fractional share in the property of such taxpayer or spouse, and if such property is a multiple-family dwelling, such credit shall be prorated to reflect the fractional portion of such property occupied by the taxpayer, as provided by state statutes, as they may be amended. Persons not otherwise eligible shall not receive any tax credit. No tax credit shall be allowed hereunder if such dwelling is used for more than three families.

(h)  The total of all tax credits granted under this section shall not exceed for each fiscal year an amount equal to Twenty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($20,000.00); tax credits given to eligible applicants hereunder shall be prorated in such a manner so that the total amount of city tax relief hereunder shall remain within the limits fixed herein. 
(i)  If any person with respect to whom a claim for tax credit in accordance with this section has been approved for any assessment year transfers, assigns, grants or otherwise conveys in such assessment year the interest in real property to which such claim for tax credit is related, regardless of whether such transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance is voluntary or involuntary, the amount of such tax credit shall be a pro rata portion of the amount otherwise applicable in such assessment year to be determined by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full months from October 1 in such assessment year to the date of such conveyance and the denominator of which shall be 12. If such conveyance occurs in the month of October, the grantor shall be disqualified for tax credit in such assessment year. The grantee shall be required within a period not exceeding ten days immediately following the date of such conveyance to notify the assessor thereof, whereupon the assessor shall determine the amount of tax credit to which the grantor is entitled for such assessment year with respect to the interest in real property conveyed and notify the tax collector of the reduced amount of tax credit applicable to such interest. 
    Upon receipt of such notice from the assessor, the tax collector shall, if such notice is received after the tax due date in the municipality, within ten days thereafter mail or hand a bill to the grantee stating the additional amount of tax due as determined by the assessor. Such tax shall be due and payable and collectible as other property taxes and subject to the same liens and processes of collection, provided such tax shall be due and payable in an initial or single installment not sooner than 30 days after the date such bill is mailed.

The location of the meter manhole shall be approved by the city engineer. The meter manhole shall be constructed in accordance with the City standard drawings and specifications. The cost of the construction and maintenance and protection of the manhole and meter or meters shall be at the sole expense of the property owner.

Total consumption billed minus normal consumption for a comparable period, equals excessive consumption. Excessive consumption divided by two (2) plus normal consumption equals total adjusted billing consumption. Total adjusted billing consumption will be computed in accordance with the present water rates. 
    This shall permit the adjustment of excessive water bills due and payable on the first Monday of January, 1973, and due and payable on the first Monday of July, 1973, and thereafter. 
(e)  If a meter fails to register, the consumer shall be charged at the rate of average daily consumption for a comparative billing period, as shown by the meter when in proper order.

(6)  Any stormwater, roof drainage, spring water, cistern or tank overflow, footing drainage, or water [drained from a] motor. 
(7)  The contents of any privy vault, septic tank, or cesspool. 
(8)  Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius). 
(9)  Any waters or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of twenty-five (25) milligrams per liter or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) and one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit. 
(10)  Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. (The installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths (3/4) horse-power (seventy-six hundredths (0.76) horsepower metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the authority.) 
(11)  The discharge from any vehicular washrack or other similar operation. 
(12)  Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron-pickling wastes, or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not. 
(13)  Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an excessive chlorine requirement to such degree that any such material received in the composite sewage at the wastewater treatment works exceeds the limits established by the authority and by the state health department and the state department of environmental protection for such materials. 
(14)  Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste-, color-, or odor-producing substances, in such concentrations, exceeding limits which may be established by the authority as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other public agencies or jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters. 
(15)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the applicable city, state or federal regulations. 
(16)  Materials which exert or cause: 
a.  Unusual concentration of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, fuller's earth [and] lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate). 
b.  Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions). 
c.  Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the wastewater treatment works. 
d.  Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting "slugs" as defined herein.

Sec. 21-70. - Modification and adjustment of discharge restrictions, etc. 
(a)  Mass limits in lieu of concentration limits. If, in establishing discharge restrictions, discharge limits or pretreatment standards pursuant to this article, the executive director establishes concentration limits to be met by an industrial user, the executive director, in lieu of concentration limits, shall establish mass limits of comparable stringency for an individual user at the request of such user. 
(b)  Adjustment for conservation steps. The conservation of water and energy shall be encouraged by the executive director. In establishing discharge restrictions upon industrial users, he shall take into account already implemented or planned conservation steps revealed by the class B user. Upon request of the executive director, each industrial user will provide the executive director with pertinent information showing [that] the quantities of substances or pollutants have not been, nor will be, increased as a result of the conservation steps. Upon such a showing to the satisfaction of the executive director, he shall make adjustments to discharge restrictions, which have been based on concentrations, to reflect the conservation steps. 
(Ord. of 6-16-80, § 5-3(b), (c)) 
Sec. 21-71. - Federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
(a)  Compliance required. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any facilities, wastewaters containing substances subject to an applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard promulgated by the EPA in excess of the quantity prescribed in such applicable pretreatment standards except as otherwise provided in this section. Compliance with such applicable pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is promulgated; provided, however, compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard for new sources shall be required upon promulgation. 
(b)  Revision to reflect removal of substances by wastewater treatment facility. Upon application by a class B user, the executive director shall revise any limitations on substances specified in the applicable pretreatment standards to reflect removal of the substances by the wastewater treatment facility. The revised discharge limit for specified substances shall be derived in accordance with federal law. 
(c)  Revision to consider factors fundamentally different from those considered by the EPA. Upon application by a class B user, the executive director shall adjust any limitation on substances specified in the applicable pretreatment standards to consider factors relating to such person which are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA during the development of the pretreatment standard. Requests for and determinations of a fundamentally different adjustment shall be in accord with federal law. 
(d)  Compliance schedule. The executive director shall notify any class B user affected by the provisions of this section and establish an enforceable compliance schedule for each. 
(Ord. of 6-16-80, § 5-4) 
Sec. 21-72. - Permissive acceptance of harmful wastes. 
(a)  Alternatives. While the executive director should initially rely upon the federal categorical pretreatment standards of section 21-71 to protect wastewater facilities or receiving waters, if any wastewater which contains substances or possesses characteristics shown to have deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or constitutes a public nuisance or hazard, is discharged or is proposed for discharge to the wastewater sewers, the executive director may: 
(1)  Require pretreatment to a condition acceptable for discharge to the wastewater sewers; 
(2)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; 
(3)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastewaters not covered by existing fees or charges; 
(4)  Require the development of compliance schedules to meet any applicable pretreatment requirements; 
(5)  Require the submission of reports necessary to assure compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements; 
(6)  Carry out all inspection, surveillance, and monitoring necessary to determine compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements; 
(7)  Obtain remedies for noncompliance by any users, and such remedies may include injunctive relief, the civil penalties specified in section 21-55, or appropriate criminal penalties; or 
(8)  Reject the wastewater-if scientific evidence discloses that discharge will create unreasonable hazards or have unreasonable deleterious effects on the wastewater facilities. 
(b)  Considerations. When considering the above alternatives, the executive director shall assure that conditions of the city's NPDES permit are met. The executive director shall also take into consideration cost-effectiveness and the economic impact of the alternatives on the discharger. If the executive director allows the pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows, the installation of the necessary facilities shall be subject to review. The executive director shall review and recommend any appropriate changes to the program within twenty (20) days of submittal. 
(c)  Determining necessity for additional pretreatment. Persons required to pretreat wastewater in accordance with this section shall provide a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the user and certified by a qualified person, indicating whether applicable pretreatment requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, describe the additional operation and maintenance or additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the pretreatment requirements. If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment requirements, the user shall submit a plan (including schedules) to the executive director. The plan (including schedules) shall be consistent with applicable conditions of the city's NPDES permit or other local, state or federal laws. 
(d)  Monitoring discharges. Discharges of wastewater to the city's wastewater facilities from the facilities of any user shall be monitored in accordance with the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of section 21-53. 
(e)  Federal pretreatment standards to supersede determination by executive director. In the event that the federal government promulgates a regulation for a given new or existing user in a specific industrial subcategory that establishes pretreatment standards or establishes that such a user is exempt from pretreatment standards, such federal regulations shall immediately supersede subsection (a) of this section. 
(f)  Revision of federal categorical pretreatment standards for substances removed by wastewater treatment facility. The executive director shall promptly apply for and obtain authorization from the EPA to revise discharge limitations for those substances listed in the federal categorical pretreatment standards for which consistent removal occurs in the wastewater treatment facilities of the city. The executive director shall not adopt or enforce discharge limitations more stringent than the requested limitations until the state or the EPA acts on the application. 
(Ord. of 6-16-80, § 5-5(a), (b), (d)-(g))

(b)  Measurements, tests, and analyses. All measurements, tests and analysis of the characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. 
    When required by the authority, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the authority. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
    Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.) Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended-solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. Samples will be made by the authority or its authorized representative, and any fee for such services is the sole responsibility of the property owner. 
(Ord. of 6-16-80, §§ 5-10, 5-11) 
Sec. 21-77. - Special agreements for acceptance of wastes of unusual strength.

    The executive director shall consider such factors as the volume and strength of discharge, rate of discharge, quantities of toxic materials in the discharge, wastewater treatment facility removal capabilities, and cost-effectiveness in determining whether or not access and equipment for monitoring class B or C wastewater discharges shall be required. Where the executive director determines access and equipment for monitoring or measuring class B or C wastewater discharges is not practicable, reliable, or cost-effective, he/she may specify alternative methods of determining the characteristics of the wastewaters discharged which will, in his/her judgment, provide an equitable measurement of such characteristic. 
(d)  Measurements, tests and analyses. 
(1)  Measurements, tests, and analyses of characteristics of wastewater to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste Water, published by the American Public Health Association, or such alternate methods approved by the executive director and which comply with state and federal law. Sampling methods, locations, times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the executive director. The discharger shall have the option to use, at his own expense, more complete sampling methods, locations, times, durations, and frequencies than specified by the executive director. 
(2)  Measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater required by this article shall be performed by a qualified laboratory. When such analyses are required of a discharger, the discharger may, in lieu of using the city's laboratory, make arrangement with any qualified laboratory, including that of the discharger, to perform such analyses. 
(3)  Monitoring of wastewater characteristics necessary for determination of compliance with applicable pretreatment standards shall be conducted on the basis of the following schedule, unless more frequent monitoring is required by authority other than this article or the executive director, in his judgment, determines that the characteristics of the specific discharge warrant a different frequency monitoring: 
Average Actual Daily User Discharge (gallons per day) Frequency 
Monitoring Less than 100,000 ..... Semiannually 100,000-999,999 ..... Quarterly More than 999,999 ..... Monthly  
(4)  Monitoring of wastewater characteristics for any purpose other than the determination of compliance with pretreatment standards shall be conducted on a frequency deemed necessary by the executive director. 
(5)  Upon demonstration by any person that the characteristics of the wastewater discharge by that person are consistent, the executive director may reduce the frequency as may be required by authority other than this article, except in no case shall the frequency of monitoring be less than semiannual for the determination of compliance with pretreatment standards. 
(6)  In determining the discharge characteristics, factors such as continuous or batch operation, and seasonal operation and the information requirements of other provisions of this article shall be considered by the executive director. The executive director may obtain wastewater samples as required to verify the consistence of discharge characteristics. 
(7)  Fees for any given measurement, test, or analysis of wastewater required by this article and performed by the city shall be the same for all classes of discharges, regardless of the quantity or quality of the discharge, and shall reflect only direct cost. Costs of analyses performed by an independent laboratory at the option of the discharger shall be borne directly by the discharger.

Sec. 21-109. - Construction specifications. 
(a)  Size, slope, alignment, materials of construction, etc. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building drain and a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the latest requirements of the building and plumbing codes, the public health code of the State of Connecticut, or other applicable rules and regulations of the city. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in the appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the authority before installation. 
(b)  Piping materials. Building drains and building sewers for class B and class C service shall be cement-lined ductile iron, reinforced-concrete pipe or vitrified clay. Building drains and building sewers for class A service shall be extra-heavy cast-iron, ductile iron, schedule 40 polypropylene, vitrified-clay [or] reinforced-concrete pipe or reinforced fiberglass. The use of materials other than cast iron or ductile iron is [permitted] dependent upon the respective pipe being laid at least two (2) feet distant from any ledge formation or boulder greater than one-half (1/2) cubic yard in size and provided that vehicular traffic will not cross the pipe unless it has at least six (6) feet of suitable cover. All materials used for the piping must be NSF approved. That portion of the building drain under jurisdiction of the building code shall comply with same. 
(c)  Pipelaying. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three (3) feet of any bearing wall. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost and provide at least fifty-four (54) inches of cover for the top of the pipe. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignments insofar as possible. The changes in direction shall be made only with curved pipe and fittings which have been approved by the authority. No more than ninety (90) degrees of directional change shall be permitted without the installation of a manhole having a barrel diameter of at least forty-eight (48) inches and an opening of at least twenty-four (24) inches in diameter. Where the building sewer will carry an average loading of more than one thousand (1,000) gallons per day or a peak loading of more than three thousand (3,000) gallons per day, the barrel diameter shall be increased to at least sixty (60) inches and the opening to at least thirty-six (36) inches. Whenever sewer lines, building drain or building sewer must cross water mains or private water lines, the sewer shall be laid at such an elevation that the top of the sewer is at least eighteen (18) inches below the bottom of the water line. If laid parallel, a horizontal separation of at least five (5) feet shall be provided. 
(d)  Elevation; use of lifts. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation to permit gravity flow to the public sewer. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a means jointly approved by the plumbing inspector and the authority and discharged through pressurized pipe to the building sewer, and suitable check and backwater valves shall be installed. All expenses of such lifting, including design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement, shall be borne by the owner. 
(e)  Backwater valves. Backwater valves shall be installed and maintained by the property owner on all sanitary and storm sewer connections the grade of which may permit backflow. Previous backflow situations shall be adequate evidence of the need for such installation. Less than three (3) feet of elevation difference between the lowest house fixture and the top of the receiving sewer shall be adequate evidence of the need for such installation. Evidence of substantial surcharge or infiltration shall also be adequate for such installation. In cases of doubt for dispute, final determination shall be made by the superintendent of water supply and gravity sewer maintenance.

    All work shall be performed by a licensed plumber (P-1, P-3, P-7 or W-9) or as indicated in the following paragraph. The plumber performing such work shall notify the plumbing inspector when the laying of a building sewer is completed. 
    Should a single-family resident elect to install the building sewer under Connecticut State Public Act No. 7 [of 1972], [amending] chapter 393 [of the General Statutes of Connecticut], the system shall be subject to inspection and approval by the city's plumbing inspector when laying of a building sewer is completed. 
    The filling of a trench before inspection is made will subject the owner to whom a permit is issued to a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense, and the owner may be required to reopen the trench for inspection. 
(Ord. of 6-16-80, §§ 4-11, 4-12) 
Sec. 21-111. - Maintenance. 
(a)  The property owner shall keep all sewer service pipes, from the main sanitary sewer to the main trap in the building, in good repair. In the event said sewer pipe from the street line to the main sanitary sewer requires cleaning, relaying or repairing, the property owner shall apply to the executive director, in writing, requesting a permit that such work may be done, stating the location and type of work to be performed. If the executive director determines that such proposed work is in conformity with this article and the plumbing code of the city, he shall issue such permit. All such work shall be paid for at the sole expense of the property owner. If such work is performed by a licensed plumber, it shall be done under the direct supervision of the executive director or his authorized agent. If the property owner requests the city to do such work, the executive director may, in his discretion, perform such work but he shall first estimate the cost of such work and require the applicant to deposit the amount of such estimated cost before the work is undertaken. If such estimated sum shall be insufficient to pay the cost of such work, the property owner shall pay the difference on demand; and if such estimated cost be more than the cost of such work, the excess shall be refunded by the city treasurer on certification by the executive director in accordance with the usual procedure. 
(b)  In the event the condition requiring the cleaning of any such sewer pipe between the main trap in the building and the main sanitary sewer was caused by interference from, or obstruction by, the roots of trees standing within the limits of the public street or highway, the cost of such cleaning shall be borne by the city and the amount deposited by the property owner shall be refunded. The method of cleaning shall be determined by the executive director.

(a)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or floating drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flow, swimming pools (if dechlorinated-typically less than one PPM chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing Pollutants; 
(2)  Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety; 
(3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test; or 
(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provide that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
(b)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitations, illicit connections made in the past regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of the ordinance if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-17-2, Pt. I) 
Sec. 21-198. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The public works department may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. 
    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-17-2, Pt. I) 
Sec. 21-199. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.

(Ord. No. 06-05-17-2, Pt. I) 
Sec. 21-200. - Monitoring of damages. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The public works department shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the public works department ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The public works department shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The public works department has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstructions to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the public works department and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the public works department access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conduction of any activity authorized or required by this article. 
(7)  If the public works department has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-17-2, Pt. I) 
Sec. 21-201. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    The public works department will adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. The BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-17-2, Pt. I)

    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-17-2, Pt. I) 
Sec. 21-203. - Notification of spills. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the US, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed to the public works department within three (3) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-17-2, Pt. I)

Purpose, Authority, and Application
Section 100 Short Title
This regulation shall be known and cited as the Zoning Regulations of the City of
New London, 1983.
Section 110 Purpose and Authority
The purpose of these zoning regulations is to encourage the most appropriate use
of land and to protect important environmental features; to conserve and stabilize
the value of property; to provide adequate open spaces for light and air; to prevent
fires; to prevent undue concentrations of population; to facilitate adequate
provisions for community utilities and facilities such as transportation, water,
sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements; to conserve energy; to
protect the integrity of the City's historic and cultural heritage; to promote health,
safety, and general welfare; and to that end to designate, regulate, and restrict the
location and use of buildings, structures, and land for residential, commercial,
industrial, or other purposes; to regulate and limit the height, size, and bulk of
buildings and structures, hereafter erected or altered; to regulate and determine
the size of yards and other spaces; to regulate the percentage of the area of the lots
that may be occupied by buildings or structures; and to regulate and limit the
density of population, to protect historically, architecturally, and culturally
significant buildings and sites, to encourage energy efficient patterns of
development, encourage use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, protect
subsurface water supplies and protect against sedimentation of waterways and
control erosion caused by wind, rain, and water movement; and for said purposes
to divide the City into zoning districts of such number, shape, and area as may be
deemed best suited to carry out this regulation and provide for its enforcement, in
accordance with Chapter 124, Section 8-2 of the Connecticut General Statutes,
1958 Revision, as amended.
Section 120 Application of Regulations

regulation and all other regulations and ordinances, laws and maps referred to
herein.
120.2 Completion of structures for which building permit has been issued. Nothing in
this regulation shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction,
or designated use of any building or structure if a building permit therefore was
duly and legally issued prior to the effective date of this regulation and actual
construction pursuant thereto was lawfully begun prior to said effective date and
has been diligently carried on.
For purposes of this section, actual construction is defined to be the actual placing
of construction materials in their permanent position and location, fastened in a
permanent manner, except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building or structure has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition and removal shall be deemed to be actual construction. Similarly,
whenever a district shall be changed hereafter, the provisions of this regulation
with regard to building permits duly and legally issued prior to the effective date
of this regulation shall apply to building permits duly and legally issued for
construction in such changed district prior to the effective date of the amendment
effecting such change.
120.3 The designations, locations, and boundaries of the zoning districts established are
delineated on the map entitled "City of New London, Connecticut, Zoning Map"
dated November 3, 1983, as amended, which map and all notations and
information thereon are hereby made a part of this regulation by reference and

Commission in accordance with the requirements of Article VIII, Section 810 of this
regulation.
1) Public and private utility substations.
2) Tennis or swim membership club subject to the following requirements:

feet.
4) Cluster Residential Development. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
approve Cluster Developments in R-l, R-lA or R-2 Districts according to the
procedures and requirements specified below. The purpose of such
development is to provide flexibility in design and development of land in
such a way as to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of utilities, limit
length of new streets and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open space.
(a) All permitted dwelling units shall be single-family attached or detached
units located on either individual lots or a common area, or a combination
thereof.
(b) The amount of common area and/or open space exclusive of buildings and
accessory uses to be created shall be a minimum of 20 percent of the total

(c) The Commission shall make a finding that the application of standard
zoning to the subject site will not be consistent with the objectives set forth
in this section. Specifically, the Commission shall take into consideration
the "open space" benefits to be gained by the development, the
neighborhood, and by the community; the specific design of the proposed
development; the nature of the topography; and the purpose for which the
open space is intended -- whether it is to provide formal or informal
recreation, provide scenic views, or preserve an unique ecological area; the
nature of adjacent areas, the proper screening and/or buffering of the units
from adjacent areas.
(d) The maximum number of single family lots for attached or detached units
that may be approved in a Cluster Development shall be computed by
subtracting from the total gross area a fixed percentage of 10 percent of said
area normally devoted to streets and dividing the remaining 90 percent of
the area by 7,500 square feet in a R-l District; 5,000 square feet in a R-lA
District; and 3,500 square feet in a R-2 District, which will result in a gross
density that is no higher than would occur under conventional development
in the particular zoning district. In computing the maximum number of lots
that may be created, lands which are subject to flooding or which are
occupied by public utility easements in such a manner as to prevent their
use and development, shall not be considered part of the total gross area.
(e) The minimum area of a Cluster Development shall be four acres and shall
be in single ownership or under unified control.
(f) Prior to the issuance of a building permit in a Cluster Development, an
application for Special Permit and Site Plan approval shall be submitted to
and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance with
Article VIII, Sections 800 and 810 and the following conditions:
(1) Said Site Plan shall include areas wherein such structures may be
located, the height and spacing of buildings, open spaces and
landscaping, off-street open and enclosed (if any) parking spaces,
and streets, driveways, and other physical features relevant to the
proposed plan.
(2) No building or parking area shall be located within 50 feet of a
street or property line.

other mechanism acceptable to the Director of Law and Commission
assuring the ownership, use and maintenance of the "open space" for
the intended purpose.

(a) Purpose and Intent. Regulate uses which, because of their very nature, are
recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics,
particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances,
thereby having deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these
uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The primary control
or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a clustering of these uses in any one
location. (Amended 07/11/88)
(b) Restrictions. Adult entertainment uses shall be subject to the following
restrictions:
(1) No such adult entertainment use shall be allowed within 1,000 feet of

the R1, R-lA, R-3, or R-4 residential zoning districts.
(3) No such adult entertainment use shall be located within 500 feet of a preexisting
public or private school, recognized public place of worship or
public library.
(4) No such adult entertainment use shall be located in any zoning district
except the CBD-1 zoned area.
For the purposes of this section, distances shall be measured in a straight line, without
regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion of the building
containing or proposing to contain an adult entertainment use to the nearest boundary of
the premises of a public place or worship, public or private school, public library, or to

(2) The name of the owner of the premises and names of the beneficial
owners if the property is in a land trust.
(3) The address of the owner and the beneficial owners.
(4) The name of the business or the establishment subject to the provisions of
this section.
(5) The name(s) of the owner, beneficial owner or the major stock holders of

(6) The address of those persons named in paragraph (5).
(7) The date of initiation of adult entertainment use.
(8) The nature of the adult entertainment use.

shall display a copy of the registration form approved by the Zoning
Officer in a conspicuous place on the premises.
(d) Exterior Display. No Adult Entertainment Use shall be conducted in any manner

shall not be required, but if provided, shall not be less than six feet in width.
(c) Rear yard - if the rear of a lot in the CBD-1district abuts upon the R district, there
shall be a rear yard of not less than 15 percent of the depth of the lot, but such a
rear yard need not exceed 20 feet. In all other cases a rear yard is not required,
except if one is provided it shall not be less than eight in depth. In the case of a
corner lot abutting a non-residential district on both streets, both interior property
lines shall be considered to be side lot lines. (Note: this avoids the need for a rear

determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
8) Lot Frontage Coverage - New buildings shall be designed to cover at least 75 percent of
the lot frontage, however, in the case where the prevailing lot frontage coverage (as
determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission) is more than 75% that degree of
coverage shall be required. If the prevailing lot frontage coverage is less than 75%, then
the Commission may, if it determines that the purpose of this zoning district is furthered,
allow the lot frontage coverage to be as low as the prevailing lot frontage coverage
530.6 Off-Street Parking and Loading
Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided for each lot within the district in
accordance with the provisions of Article VI, Section 614 of these regulations.
530.7 Facade Review

plan to the Design Review Board of the Historic District Commission, and the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall give due consideration to any report filed with it by said Committee
prior to rendering a decision on the facade plan. If no report is received from said Committee
within thirty-five (35) days of the referral, it shall be presumed that the Committee has no
objection to the facade plan. (Amended 02/10/86)
530.8 Permanent Facade Extensions
Facade extensions on ground or upper floors are permitted subject to issuance of a special permit
by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Extending certain building fronts into the right-of-way
is desirable from a design viewpoint as it enhances the pedestrian environment by injecting
interest and animation to the streetscape. From a private viewpoint, it increases square footage of
stores in a manner, which maximizes exposure of their products. Because many buildings along
major thoroughfares are of historic or architectural significance, extension of facades may not be
appropriate. However, many opportunities do exist in which facade extensions would be
desirable.
The extensions could exist in a variety of physical forms but must adhere to the following
general criteria:
CBD-1
1) Granting of a right of encroachment by the City Council.
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE V-31
2) Detailed review of the design treatment of the building and its impact on the block face is
required.
3) The extensions must be at least 75 percent transparent.
4) Displays must be pedestrian focused.
5) The entire facade is renovated as part of any extension.
6) No more than 35 percent of a block face is available for extensions.
7) All extensions are illuminated during evening hours until midnight.
8) No extensions are permitted on certified historic buildings unless concurrence of the
State Historic Preservation Officer is obtained.
9) Access to underground utilities must be considered in the design.
Several types of extensions are possible and are enumerated below to serve as guidelines for
property owners, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Zoning Official:
1) Display Windows: Ground floor extensions into the right-of-way for purposes of
display of goods. Extensions limited to 1 1/2 to 2 feet and taking the form of a
bay window or similar projection. Should be primarily transparent except for
window mullions and support and be illuminated. Goods displayed should be
presented in a highly attractive manner to add color and interest to the street
scene. Could also be developed at second floor level.
2) Display Kiosks: Free standing structure adjacent to store and displaying goods
contained in store. The requirements for transparency, illumination and retail
presentation outlined for the display windows are applicable here.
3) Ground Level Storefront Extension: Extensions should be developed at grade
with materials at least 75 percent transparent excluding the roof element.
Pedestrian's view of the activities within is to be maximized and visual
competition between the new extension and the original building should be
minimized.
4) Upper Level Extension: This form of extension is not appropriate for certified
historic buildings. The extension must be carefully scaled to the facade of the
building from which it originates. The extension could be cantilevered from its
host building or supported by columns and terminated below any cornice work or,
if none exists, that of adjacent buildings. Again, maximum transparency on all
CBD-1
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE V-32
side surfaces to permit views out and in is a key objective. Evening lighting is
important to producing interest to the street scene. This type of extension is
feasible for streets where the narrow sidewalk width does not permit ground level
extensions.
530.9 Conversion of an existing building to residential dwelling. (Amended 8/23/05)
As a means of preserving existing sound buildings, especially historically or architecturally
significant structures, as well as to encourage population in the central business area and provide
an additional housing resource, subject to the issuance of a Special Permit, conversion of
existing
buildings that do not meet minimum lot size requirements for residential use or additional
residential units is permitted, provided that:
(a) The building is in existence on the effective date of this regulation.
(b) The minimum floor area of a dwelling unit not containing a separate bedroom shall be
400 square feet.
(c) The minimum floor area of a one bedroom dwelling unit shall be 600 square feet.
(d) Off-street parking space shall be provided in accordance with requirements of Article VI,
Section 614 of this regulation, and such space shall be located within 500 feet of the
premises.
(e) No residential unit is located on the street level floor(s) unless a Special permit under
530.2 (43) has been obtained.
530.10 Approval of Buildings with Mixed Residential and Commercial Uses (Amended 08/23/05)
Buildings with mixed residential and commercial uses are allowed upon the issuance of a Special
Permit subject to the following requirements:
(a) Separate entrances and exits shall be provided for residential and non-residential portions
of the building.
530.11 Approval of New Construction (Amended 8/23/05)
Any construction of new principal buildings or any of the following changes which comprise
more than 10% of the gross floor area of the existing principal building: new accessory
buildings, additions to accessory buildings, major additions to existing buildings are allowed
only by Special Permit. Additions to buildings made after the effective date of this regulation
change shall be considered on a cumulative basis towards the 10% threshold requiring a Special
Permit under this regulation.

excellence. In making this determination the Commission may seek the advise of a
professional architect licensed to practice in the State of Connecticut (the fee for whose
services may be charged to the applicant as provided for by City Ordinance), This
determination shall also address compliance with the following criteria:
(a) The massing, roof design, and remainder of the design of the exterior of the
building shall adequately incorporate and address and Design Review Guidelines
for the CBD districts or any similar document that may be adopted by the
Commission.
(b) The exterior of the building shall reflect the use of material of an enduring
quality.
(c) The creation of parking under, within, or on top of the building, or the
Commission finds that the parking requirements are substantially exceeded in
another acceptable manner.
(d) The facades of the street level floors fronting City owned roads shall be reserved
for use by non-office commercial uses.
3) Maximum Front Yard Setback - New buildings shall have a maximum five-foot setback
from the front property line or a zero set back from the prevailing building line as this
may be determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
4) Lot Frontage Coverage - New buildings shall be designed to cover at least 60 percent of
the lot frontage, however, in the case where the prevailing lot frontage coverage (as
determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission) is more than 60% that degree of
coverage shall be required. If the prevailing lot frontage coverage is less than 60%, then
the Commission may, if it determines that the purpose of this zoning district is furthered,
allow the lot frontage coverage to be as low as the prevailing lot frontage coverage.
535.6 Off-Street Parking and Loading
Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided for each lot within the district in
accordance with the provisions of Article VI, Section 614 of these regulations.
535.7 Facade Review
Any new facade or change in the facade of an existing building shall be reviewed by the
Commission for evaluation of architecture and design. The Commission shall refer a copy of any
facade plan to the Design Review Board of the Historic District Commission, and the Planning
CBD-2
and Zoning Commission shall give due consideration to any report filed with it by said
Committee prior to rendering a decision on the facade plan. If no report is received from said
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE V-39
Committee within thirty-five (35) days of the referral, it shall be presumed that the Committee
has no objection to the facade plan. (Amended 02/10/86)
535.8 Permanent Facade Extensions
Facade extensions on ground or upper floors are permitted subject to issuance of a special permit
by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Extending certain building fronts into the right-of-way
is desirable from a design viewpoint as it enhances the pedestrian environment by injecting
interest and animation to the streetscape. From a private viewpoint, it increases square footage of
stores in a manner, which maximizes exposure of their products. Because many buildings along
major thoroughfares are of historic or architectural significance, extension of facades may not be
appropriate. However, many opportunities do exist in which facade extensions would be
desirable.
The extensions could exist in a variety of physical forms but must adhere to the following
general criteria:
1) Granting of a right of encroachment by the City Council.
2) Detailed review of the design treatment of the building and its impact on the block face is
required.
3) The extensions must be at least 75 percent transparent.
4) Displays must be pedestrian focused.
5) The entire facade is renovated as part of any extension.
6) No more than 35 percent of a block face is available for extensions.
7) All extensions are illuminated during evening hours until midnight.
8) No extensions are permitted on certified historic buildings unless concurrence of the
State Historic Preservation Officer is obtained.
9) Access to underground utilities must be considered in the design.
Several types of extensions are possible and are enumerated below to serve as guidelines for
property owners, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Zoning Official:
1) Display Windows: Ground floor extensions into the right-of-way for purposes of
display of goods. Extensions limited to 1 1/2 to 2 feet and taking the form of a
bay
CBD-2
window or similar projection. Should be primarily transparent except for window
mullions and support and be illuminated. Goods displayed should be presented in
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE V-40
a highly attractive manner to add color and interest to the street scene. Could also
be developed at second floor level.
2) Display Kiosks: Free standing structure adjacent to store and displaying goods
contained in store. The requirements for transparency, illumination and retail
presentation outlined for the display windows are applicable here.
3) Ground Level Storefront Extension: Extensions should be developed at grade
with materials at least 75 percent transparent excluding the roof element.
Pedestrian's view of the activities within is to be maximized and visual
competition between the new extension and the original building should be
minimized.
4) Upper Level Extension: This form of extension is not appropriate for certified
historic buildings. The extension must be carefully scaled to the facade of the
building from which it originates. The extension could be cantilevered from its
host building or supported by columns and terminated below any cornice work or,
if none exists, that of adjacent buildings. Again, maximum transparency on all
side surfaces to permit views out and in is a key objective. Evening lighting is
important to producing interest to the street scene. This type of extension is
feasible for streets where the narrow sidewalk width does not permit ground level
extensions.
535.9 Approval of Buildings with Mixed Residential and Commercial Uses
Buildings with mixed residential and commercial uses are allowed upon the issuance of a Special
Permit subject to the following requirements:
(a) Separate entrances and exits shall be provided for residential and non-residential portions
of the building.
535.10 Approval of New Construction
Any construction of new principal buildings or any of the following changes which comprise
more than 10% of the gross floor area of the existing principal building: new accessory
buildings, additions to accessory buildings, major additions to existing buildings are allowed
only by Special Permit. Additions to buildings made after the effective date of this regulation
change shall be considered on a cumulative basis towards the 10% threshold requiring a Special
Permit under this regulation.

Section 537 IHZ- Incentive Housing Zone Overlay District
(Amended 12/15/10)
537.1 Purposes. The Incentive Housing Zone is an overlay district whose purposes are:
1) To assist the City of New London in complying with the State Zoning Enabling Act,
Connecticut General Statute §8-2, by adopting zoning regulations that promote housing
choice and economic diversity, including housing for moderate income households.
2) To promote the revitalization of New Londons Downtown by encouraging residential or
mixed-use development that will provide for a variety of housing and business
opportunities in a pedestrian oriented environment.
3) To encourage use of underutilized land areas on parcels with existing development where
new housing would be compatible with and complimentary to existing uses on the site
and in the downtown.
4) To encourage rehabilitation and renovation of existing historic and older buildings in the
downtown to convert underutilized space in the upper stories to residential use.
5) To encourage smart growth and low-impact development.
6) To ensure high quality and creative site planning, architecture, and landscape design that
is consistent with the downtown and the specific subdistrict where the proposal lies, the
distinct visual character of the historic structures in New London, and the scenic beauty
of the waterfront and historic areas.
537.2 Location. The boundaries of the IHZ Overlay District are shown on the City of New London
Zoning Map. The IHZ Overlay District is further divided into subdistricts as shown on the
supplementary IHZ map.
537.3 Applicability.
1) The regulations in this §537 shall apply to any proposed Incentive Housing Development
within the IHZ Overlay District. The provisions of the underlying zoning district shall
not apply to a proposed Incentive Housing Development unless otherwise indicated in
this §537, and such underlying zoning designation shall terminate upon approval of a site
plan of an Incentive Housing Development. Reinstatement of the underlying zoning shall
automatically occur upon rescission of the site plan, approved by vote of the Planning &
Zoning Commission.
2) The provisions of the following sections of the New London Zoning Regulations shall
apply to an Incentive Housing Development proposal. No other sections shall be
applicable unless specifically made applicable by and within this §537.

537.4 Description of Subdistricts.
1) Eastern Core. This subdistrict is 31.6 acres excluding rights-of-way, and overlays the
CBD-1 District in the downtown area (northeast of Sparyard Street). It includes the area
between Eugene ONeill Drive and Water Street, State Street, and Bank Street-the core
of the historic center of New London. This area has experienced numerous changes in
uses and architectural styles over the past four centuries, resulting in an eclectic mix of
buildings today. The intent of this IHZ subdistrict is to contribute to the revitalization of
New Londons downtown by creating opportunities for reuse of underutilized upper
stories in existing buildings as well as for redevelopment of underutilized sites for new
mixed use buildings with residential uses in the upper stories. Non-residential use of
street level space is required, to enhance the streetscape as an interesting pedestrian
oriented environment with many places to go (shops, restaurants, galleries, etc.).
IHZ
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE V-43
2) North/South. This subdistrict is 16. 56 acres excluding the rights-of-way and
corresponds to the CBD-2 District. Split by the Eastern Core subdistrict, this area
includes development that is not as dense, primarily as a result of the urban renewal
efforts in the late 1960s. Several historic properties remain, including the four Whale
Oil Row homes (now offices), the Acorn Barns House at 68 Federal Street (also offices),
and the Bishop House (now offices and apartments) among others. Many of the more
modern buildings are located in this subdistrict, including the 1914 Monte Cristo Garage
(now mixed use with housing and commercial), the Radisson Hotel, and the Southern
New England Telephone complex. The intent of this subdistrict is to contribute to the
revitalization of New Londons downtown by creating opportunities for redevelopment
of underutilized properties to include residential uses. Non-residential use of street level
space is encouraged where surrounding properties would not be conducive to residential
use at the street level, to enhance the streetscape and weave these areas into the fabric of
the downtown.
3) Northwest. This subdistrict is 2.56 acres (there are no rights-of-way within it), and is
underlain by the C-1 District. This small area is adjacent to the historic properties along
the eastern side of Huntington Street, and includes three properties which are currently
underutilized for their location at the edge of the downtown and near the courthouse. The
intent of this subdistrict is to provide opportunity for redevelopment of these sites to
better incorporate this area into the downtown, to improve the appearance of the
streetscape adjacent to Whale Oil Row, and to better utilize the land area available.
537.5 Permitted Uses and Dimensional Requirements.

accordance with the provisions of Article VI, Section 614 of these regulations, except as follows:
1) Because the WD District is important to the Citys economy, provides a local service and
employment base, and because its physical integrity must be enhanced, and further
because it is desirable to utilize existing buildings as fully and as efficiently as possible,
required parking for uses within the WD District may be provided on sites other than the
site which they serve provided that:
(a) Said spaces are within 500 feet walking distance of the lot or use which they
serve.
(b) The parking lot or spaces shall conform to the provisions of the district in which
they are located. In the case of a privately owned lot which is serving a primary

as a permitted accessory use.
(c) Such spaces shall be in the same ownership as the use which they serve and shall
be subject to a deed restriction binding the owner and his heirs and assigns to
maintain the required number of spaces either (1) throughout the existence of the
use to which they are accessory, or (2) until such spaces are provided elsewhere.
Required off-street spaces which, after development, are dedicated and accepted
by the City, shall be deemed to continue to serve the uses for which they were
originally provided.

provide a greater degree of flexibility in project design through approval of
modifications of the zoning requirements described herein. In approving such
modifications, the Commission shall consider the requirements of Section 550.7,
as well as the review criteria described below. Approval of modifications is
strictly limited to the requirements and provisions of this section, and shall be
accomplished through approval of a special permit by the Commission. (Amended
09/01/98)
2) Permissible Modifications and Applicable Review Criteria

WCI-2
modifications. These criteria are in addition to those provided for in Section 840
Coastal Site Plans, Section 800 Site Plans and Section 810 Special Permits. The
approval of any modifications shall also be consistent with any and all
requirements of Section 800, 810 and 840 as applicable. (Amended 09/01/98)
A. Permissible Modifications in all WCI-2 Developments
(1) Minimum Lot Frontage (ref. Section 550.5.3)
Where the Commission deems it desirable and feasible, it may
approve a site plan for a use which does not have frontage on a public
street, provided that the lot meets all other requirements and access is
assured by convenants or other instrument acceptable to the Planning
& Zoning Commission. (Amended 09/01/98)
(2) Minimum Side Yard Setback (ref. Section 550.5.4)
The Commission may permit a reduction in the side yard to 0 if in
its judgment such a reduction will help to achieve the purposes of the
district. If a sideyard is provided however, it must be at least 10 feet.
(Amended 09/01/98)
(3) Maximum Building Height (ref. Section 550.5.6)
The maximum height may be increased, provided that parking is
created under, within, or on top of the structure, or the Commission
finds that parking requirements are substantially exceeded in some
other manner of off-street parking. (Amended 09/01/98)
B. Permissible Height Modifications for Development on Lots Under 15
Acres (ref. Section 550.5.6)
The Planning & Zoning Commission has determined that the loss of
public views of the Thames River and Long Island Sound contribute
significantly to the destruction of the character of the City as a waterfront
community. As a means to protect and enhance the existing and potential
views of the water, the City has created the following incentives to
encourage development that works to achieve this policy. In reviewing
the special permit applications under this section, the Commission shall
take into consideration the impact of the proposed activity on visual
access to the water. This consideration shall be made with the objective
that waterfront property shall be developed in a manner to maximize
visual access to and from the water. (Amended 09/01/98)

C. Additional Permissible Modifications for Development on Lots of 15
Acres or More.
The Commission recognizes the need to provide design and procedural
flexibility for complex, large scale developments which may include a mix
of uses, or which may be developed in phases over a period of years.
Therefore, developments on lots of 15 acres or more may apply for, and
the Commission may approve, modifications to the following provisions:
(09/01/98)
(1) Lot Coverage (ref. Section 550.5.5)
The Commission may increase maximum lot coverage from
50% to no more than 65% if the additional coverage is devoted
exclusively to one or more parking structures. (Amended
09/01/98)
(2) Maximum Building Height (ref. Section 550.5.6)
The Planning & Zoning Commission has determined that the loss
of public views of the Thames River and Long Island Sound
contribute significantly to the destruction of the character of the
City as a waterfront community. As a means to protect and
enhance the existing and potential views of the water, the City has
created the following incentives to encourage development that
works to achieve this policy. In reviewing the special permit
applications under this section, the Commission shall take into
consideration the impact of the proposed activity on visual access
to the water. This consideration shall be made with the objective
that waterfront property shall be developed in a manner to
maximize visual access to and from the water. (Amended

The Commission may modify the requirements of Section 605H in
order to permit a unified arrangement of buildings on one parcel.
In reviewing requests for modifications of these provisions, the
Commission shall consider provisions for internal vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, building designs, heights and separation
distances, site and building ownership and control, parking
location and design, emergency access and the location and nature
of abutting uses. (Amended 09/01/98)
(4) Location of Accessory Structures (ref. Section 607)
The Commission may allow accessory structures to be placed in
required yards, including front yards, subject to a review of the
size and design of the proposed structure, proposed landscaping

developments which will abut a WCI-2, WD, LI-O, C-1, CBD,
INST, or OS district. In reviewing such modifications, the
Commission shall consider the location and nature of abutting
uses, the security and operational needs of the proposed use, fence
design, height and materials, maintenance provisions, site
topography, views to the water, and access for emergency
personnel and vehicles. (Amended 09/01/98)

11) Lighting
Off-street parking areas shall be adequately illuminated for convenience and safety, but
no lighting for parking areas shall cause glare on adjoining property.
12) Surface Treatment
a) All parking areas shall be paved with a durable, dust free all weather surface of
bituminous or concrete paving, maintained in good condition. However, the
Commission may allow an alternate surface treatment if the use is a low traffic
generator, or if the design is part of a storm water management plan to minimize
storm water impacts. In these cases the applicant shall submit a maintenance
plan to the Commission for their approval.
13) Landscaping and Screening.
a) On any parcel where a Site Plan approval or Special Permit is required and the
parking area faces a street or a property line, a landscape area of a minimum
width of three (3) feet planted with a combination of grass, perennials, ground
cover or shrubs shall be planted between the parking area and the street line or
property line. The landscape area shall include at least one deciduous tree of not
less than three (3) inch caliper and at least six (6) feet in overall height at time of
planting for every fifty (50) feet along the perimeter of the parking lot. The trees
may be planted in groupings to enhance the landscaping of the parking lot.
b) Where a parking area abuts a residential property, it shall be screened from view
by a buffer consisting of landscaping, a berm, opaque fence or wall, or other
means as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. This buffer shall be
planted sufficiently close and be large enough when constructed to effectively
screen automobile headlights. Within the CBD zone this requirement shall only
apply to parking areas abutting a residential zoning district but shall apply
whether or not the abutting properties in the residential zoning district are
currently in residential use. (Amended 09/20/07)
c) The Commission may reduce or waive the landscaping requirements within a
parking area and between a parking area and a street line when the area is used as
a display area of a new or used automobile dealership, or if the Commission
determines that adequate existing landscaping around the site is retained in a
manner to insure that the site will be aesthetically pleasing, or where the parking
area is functionally integrated with an adjoining area on an abutting lot.
d) All parking areas containing 20 or more off-street parking spaces shall provide at
least 10 square feet of interior landscaping within the paved portion of the parking
area for each parking space. Each separate landscape island shall contain a
minimum area of 100 square feet. No landscape island shall be less than 8 feet
wide.
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE VI-33
e) These landscape islands shall be designed and located to assure safe and efficient
channelization of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic and to separate the major
accessways through the parking area from parking aisles. Each separate
landscape island within the parking area shall be contained by the use of cast in
place concrete curbing, stone or precast concrete curbing or other suitable
material as approved.
f) Plantings in landscaped areas shall be consistent with the visibility requirements
of Section 606 of these Regulations, both at street intersections and at exit
driveway intersections with abutting streets.

eliminate the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) above; to include in lieu
thereof some combination or wall/fencing and/or landscaping in a three-foot
buffer strip to be maintained along all areas where a parking lot fronts a public
street. Landscaping elements shall only include those that grow or are maintained
at a low height (less than three feet) and shall include a combination of formal
evergreen hedges and trees (one tree per fifty-five feet of street frontage) unless
an alternative is determined by the Commission to be more appropriate. (Amended
09/20/07)
14) Parking Structures
a) The dimensional standards for parking spaces, parking aisles and driveway grades
may be reduced by up to twenty (20) percent for parking structures.
b) The landscaping and screening requirements of this section shall not apply to the
interior parking areas of parking structures.
15) Pavement Marking
All required parking spaces, directional arrows, stop bars, fire lanes and loading areas
shall be marked by painted lines maintained in good condition or by curbs or other means
to indicate individual spaces. Additionally, directional arrows and signs shall be
provided where necessary.
16) Connections Between Abutting Parking Areas
Where appropriate, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require paved driveway
connections between abutting parking areas in different ownerships, so as to facilitate the
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE VI-34
flow of traffic for the public to travel between sites without the need to travel on a public
street.
17) Operation and Maintenance of Off-Street Parking Facilities
a) Required off-street parking facilities shall be maintained throughout the life of
any use or structure, which the said facilities are designed to serve.
b) Required parking areas developed for specific structures and uses shall be
reserved at all times for the use of those persons who are employed at, or making
use of, such structures and uses, except when dedicated to, and accepted by, the
City as public parking areas.
18) Designation of Employee Parking Areas
For retail and service establishments, and for other uses with a frequent exchange of
customers or patrons, employee parking shall be designated in parking spaces remote
from entrances so as to retain closer spaces for customers or clients.
19) Fire Lanes
a) Fire Lanes shall be provided as required by the Fire Department.
b) No parking shall be permitted in areas designated as fire lanes on any site plans
approved under these regulations or established by the Citys Fire Marshal.
c) No Parking signs shall be posted in accordance with the requirements of the
Fire Department.
20) Stormwater Drainage
a) Parking areas shall be graded and drained to dispose of all surface water in
accordance with sound engineering principles.
b) No storm water drainage shall be allowed to cross any sidewalk area or public
streets.
c) Drainage shall be designed by a professional engineer licensed in the State of
Connecticut.
d) The commission shall require that a stormwater management plan is submitted for
all proposed parking lots consisting of twenty-five (25) or more parking spaces.
However, the Commission may require a stormwater management plan for any
proposal if it determines that the site disturbance and proposed use may cause
significant nonpoint source pollution. The stormwater management plan shall
provide, but not be limited to at a minimum the following information: (The
Citys Office of Development and Planning (ODP) has been charged with the
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE VI-35
responsibility to prepare a recommended format for stormwater management plan
submissions to the Commission under these regulations. All applicants are
encouraged to consult with ODP staff prior to application submission.)
(1) Soil characteristics including soil types, hydrologic soil group, and depth
to bedrock and groundwater where necessary.
(2) DEP ground/surface water quality classification of the site.
(3) Location and description of all proposed best management practices
(BMPs) both for construction activities and post-construction long-term
nonpoint source pollution control.
(4) Proposed maintenance and operation manual or schedule for any
stormwater control methods.
(5) Hydrologic analysis and calculations of stormwater runoff rates and water
quality pollutant concentrations including suspended solids removal rates
for pre and post development.
(6) To the extent practicable, maintain post-development peak runoff rate and
average volume at levels that are similar to pre-development levels and
reduces post-development average annual total suspended solid (TSS)
loads by 80%.
e) Stormwater management systems shall be designed and maintained to manage site
runoff in order to prevent flooding, control peak discharges where required, and
maximize retention and water quality treatment on-site.
f) On proposed sites with discharges of stormwater within five-hundred (500) feet of
coastal waters, the stormwater management system shall be designed to retain and
treat the volume generated by the first one (1) inch of rainfall unless a
demonstration can be made that specific site constraints prevent meeting this goal.
In such case, the stormwater management system should be designed to retain and
treat the maximum amount that is technically feasible.
D. Joint Use of Parking Areas/Shared Parking
In the case of two or more structures or uses on the same lot or on contiguous lots, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may approve the joint use of parking areas for sites using the same
driveway giving access thereto where the total capacity of the parking area shall not be less than
the sum of the space required for each use computed separately, or the Commission may approve
a Special Permit to permit the joint use where the total capacity is less than the sum of the spaces
required for each use computed separately, provided:
1) A finding is made by the Commission that the proposed capacity will substantially meet
the intent of these regulations.
2) In a mixed-use development, there are two or more uses which have differences in their
principal operating hours, thereby allowing the utilization of the same parking spaces.
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE VI-36
3) If a use is enlarged, changed or terminated the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
have the discretion to terminate the approval of such joint use or require full compliance
for each separate use upon finding that conditions justifying joint use no longer exist.
4) If a use is located within five-hundred (500) feet of another use such as a church that is
not in operation during the same hours or days as the first use, and where such church or
other use is willing to make its parking available to the first use through written
agreement acceptable to the Citys Director of Law.
5) An agreement for the construction, use, and maintenance of such joint parking and loading
area, and the cost thereof, shall be entered into by all participating owners and the
continuance of such agreement shall be guaranteed by a covenant identified on the site
plan and filed with the deed of each participating property binding each participating
owner and his successors in interest for the life of the joint use of the facility. Any
covenant for such joint use shall be in a form acceptable to the Citys Law Director.
6) Upon finding that the foregoing conditions have been met, and where the joint parking
facility adjoins or straddles a joint lot line, the Planning and Zoning Commission may, for
the period covered by such agreement waive the requirements applicable to side yards.
E. Waiver and Reductions of the Number of Required Parking Spaces (Amended 9/30/08)
New uses in the CBD-1 and CBD 2 Districts located within buildings in existence as of the
effective date of this amendment, or in additions not defined in this section as major, shall not
be required to provide any parking spaces in addition to those already serving the building either
on or off the property. Reduction, relocation or elimination of these existing spaces may be
allowed only by Special Permit if the requirements of subsection 1) below are met.
All or portions of the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required as a result of the
construction of new buildings or the major expansion of existing buildings (i.e. consisting of
more than 25% of the gross floor area in existence as of the effective date of this regulation) may
be waived or reduced at the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission by issuance of a
Special Permit provided that:
1) Central Business Districts (CBD-1 and CBD-2)
a) The proposed use is within 500 feet in the CBD-1 and CBD-2 Districts of a
municipally operated off-street parking facility or privately owned and operated
parking area. The aforesaid five hundred (500) feet shall be measured by the
shortest route of the available pedestrian access between any entrance to such use
and the entrance the parking facilities.
b) At the time of submission of a permit application the applicant shall provide a
report from the Citys Parking Commission that the municipally operated
off-street parking facility or, in the case where nearby private parking area is to be
utilized, a report from the owner or operator of the private parking facility that the
lot has adequate capacity for storage of passenger vehicles generated by activities
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
PAGE VI-37
proposed to be conducted on the subject lot in addition to those generated by any
other lots already serviced by such off-street parking facility. In determining the
existence of such adequate capacity, the Commission shall consider the need for
preventing frequent parking on the street by persons visiting or connected with
each use which is proposed to be served by such off-street municipal or private
parking facility.
c) Where a private parking facility is to be utilized, the applicant shall provide
written assurance from the owner that such facility will be available for the life of
the proposed use.
All or portions of the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces may be waived or
reduced at the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission by issuance of a Special
Permit provided that:
2) Van/Car Pools
An applicant may partially satisfy the off-street parking requirement if the applicant can
document that a van pool, car pool or employee public transit program will be in
operation for the duration of the use. Each two (2) occupied seats in a van or transit bus
shall be considered as one parking space for purposes of this section. A plan shall be
submitted to show how the alternative mode(s) will be implemented, the permanency of
such mode(s), the extent of the program, number of vehicles and any other pertinent
information. The applicant shall record a covenant, the content and form of which must
be approved by the Director of Law, which binds all successors in title to the
commitments approved and the petitioner shall include in all leases a clause, content and
form approved by the Director of Law, which binds all tenants to the commitments made
by the applicant.
3) Reduction of Number of Parking Spaces
a) Parking space requirements for a particular use as established by these regulations
may be reduced if an applicant can demonstrate that the intensity of the particular
use will need a lesser amount of parking than is otherwise required.
b) An application for a reduction in the number of required parking spaces shall
include a survey of persons using and working on the premises in order to
demonstrate that the number of spaces provided in the permit application are
sufficient to accommodate the vehicles of all persons using and visiting the
facilities specified in the application.
c) The Special Permit shall be applicable only to the specific use or occupancy of
land, buildings or other structures specified in the application. The Special Permit
shall become null and void in the event that the use or occupancy is changed to
another use or occupancy.

than forty (40) feet from R-1 or R-1a Districts and not less than 25 feet
from all other districts shall be provided and maintained along all property
lines. This requirement may be modified, by the Planning and Zoning
Commission after a written request, provided that the Commission
determines that as a result of topography, vegetation or other factors
unique to the parcel, such a buffer is not needed to protect residential uses.
(4) All entrances and exits to such additional parking areas shall be through
the portion of the lot located in the non-residential zone or the adjoining
property containing the principal use.
(5) Parking structures are not permitted.
(6) The lot containing such spaces shall be in the same ownership as the
property to which it is accessory.
G. Off-Street Loading Facilities
1) Off-street loading facilities shall be required on the same lot as the principal building or
structure.
2) Determination of Required Loading Spaces
Where the Planning and Zoning Commission determines the number of loading berths,

Section 615 Signs
All of Section 615 of the Zoning Regulations (Signs) including the illustration found on page VI-45 are hereby
deleted and the following is inserted in its place. (Amended 08/23/99)
A. Purpose and Intent
1) The purpose of this section of the zoning regulations is to promote, preserve, enhance and protect
the public health, safety, and welfare of the City by regulating signs of all types on public and
private property through the establishment of standards to control the location, number, size,
height, maintenance and character of signs. The indiscriminate construction, erection and
maintenance of signs can create undue distractions to motorists and pedestrians, may tend to
depreciate property values and may be detrimental to the preservation and enhancement of the
aesthetic and historical values of the City. These regulations are intended to:
a) Provide specific and enforceable standards to protect the community.
b) Protect property values.
c) Encourage the installation of signs that assist in the creation of a more attractive economic
and business climate so that travelers, visitors, residents and business people patronize the
Citys commercial establishments.
d) Enhance and protect the aesthetic appearance and historical heritage of the City.
e) Provide adequate identification, communication and advertising for land uses.
f) Distinguish between the Citys various zoning districts and the desired character and
development patterns of each district.
g) Ensure that signs are compatible with their surroundings.
2) In evaluating all sign applications, the Planning & Zoning Commission (PZC) and the Zoning
Enforcement Officer (ZEO) shall insure that the sign:
a) Reduces distractions, confusion and obstructions that may contribute to unsafe traffic
conditions.
b) Minimizes the adverse effect on adjacent property and the general public.
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019

ARTICLE VII.
Non-Conforming Uses, Lots and Structure
Section 700 General
A non-conforming use, lot or structure is one which existed lawfully, whether by variance or
otherwise, prior to the date these regulations or any amendment thereto became effective, and
which fails to conform to one or more of the applicable requirements of these regulations or any
amendment thereto.
Section 710 Non-Conforming Uses
A. No non-conforming use of land shall be enlarged, extended or altered except in changing
the use to one which is permitted in the District in which such use is located. No
non-conforming use of an existing structure shall be extended to occupy land outside
such structure or space in another structure.
B. No non-conforming use of land shall be moved to another part of a lot or outside the lot,
and no non-conforming use of a structure shall be moved to any part of the structure not
manifestly arranged and designed for such use at the time the use became
non-conforming, and no structure containing a non-conforming use shall be moved,
unless the result of such move is to end the non-conforming use.
C. No non-conforming use of land or of a structure shall be changed to any use which is
substantially different in nature and purpose from the former non-conforming use, except
such uses as are permitted in the district in which they are located.
D. When a non-conforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not hereafter
be changed to any use not permitted in the district in which the use is located.
E. Any non-conforming use which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be reestablished.
Any structure or land, or structure and land in combination, which has been abandoned,
shall not again be devoted to any use other than those uses which are permitted in the
district in which the structure of land, or structure and land in combination, is located.
The term abandonment, as used herein, shall mean the discontinuance of a use, when
accompanied by an intent not to reestablish such use. Any of the following shall
constitute prima facie evidence of intent to abandon:
1) any positive act indicating such intent; or
2) in the case of a structure or of a structure and land in combination, discontinuance
of the non-conforming use for 12 consecutive months or for a total of 18 months
during any three-year period;
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VII-2
3) in the case of land only, discontinuance of the non-conforming use for 90
consecutive days, or for a total of six months during any one-year period.
Section 720 Non-Conforming Lots
A. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of these regulations, single-family dwellings and
customary accessory buildings may be erected on any lot with non-conforming frontage
provided no contiguous lots are in the same ownership as evidence by deeds recorded in
the Land Records of the City of New London prior to the effective date of these
regulations, or any amendments thereto which created such non-conforming lot, provided
that construction on and use of each such lot shall comply with all other provisions of
these regulations.
B. If two or more contiguous lots or combinations of lots or portions of lots in single
ownership are of record at the effective date of these regulations, or any amendment
thereto, and if all or part of such lots do not meet the requirements for lot frontage, width
or area as established by these regulations, or any amendment thereto, the land involved
shall be considered to be an undivided lot for the purposes of these regulations, except as
provided in Article VII, Section 720.C herein. No portion of said undivided lot shall be
used or sold as a building lot which does not meet lot frontage, width and area
requirements established within these regulations, nor shall any division of a lot be made
which leaves any remaining lot with frontage, width or area below the requirements
stated within these regulations.
C. Where two or more lots or combinations of lots or portions of lots with continuous
frontage are in single ownership as described in Article VII, Section 720.B herein and a
lawfully erected building containing a primary use is located on such lot or lots, such lots
shall be combined in such a way that each primary use is located on a conforming lot and
in no case shall any lot be so created or maintained which is non-conforming in area,
width, or frontage.
D. If any non-conforming lot contains an existing conforming use within an existing
structure, permitted accessory uses may be erected and any existing conforming structure
may be modified, altered, or expanded so long as all new construction complies with all
other applicable requirements of these regulations.
E. However, no requirement contained within this Article VII, Section 720 shall supersede
the provisions of Sections 8-26a, 8-28a and 8-28b of the Connecticut State Statutes.
Section 730 Non-Conforming Structures
A. Any non-conforming structure lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of these
regulations may be continued to be used, as long as such use is either permitted within
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VII-3
the district in which it is located or is a legal non-conforming use; such structure may be
expanded, modified or altered in accordance with the following provisions:
l) For non-residential structures, such expansion, modification or alteration must
bring the non-conforming structure into conformity with district regulations and
must not result in the expansion of a non-conforming use. No increase in the area,
any dimension or bulk of structure in non-conformity shall be permitted and all
new construction shall comply with all requirements of these regulations.
2) For residential structures, such expansion, modification, or alteration is permitted
provided that no new non-conformity or increased encroachment results, or no
non-conforming use is established or expanded.
B. If destroyed by fire or an act of God, legally existing non-conforming residential
structures may be reconstructed to the original size, density of use, and location on the
lot. If the structure is located in a flood hazard area, the reconstruction shall comply with
applicable flood management regulations. (Amended 07/26/06)
Section 740 Maintenance and Restoration of Structure Containing Non-Conforming Uses
In order to assure that structures containing non-conforming uses will be maintained in safe and
decent condition for so long as such non-conforming uses continue, nothing in these regulations
shall be deemed to prohibit:
A. Work to be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of walls, ceilings,
floors, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, in the non-conforming structure or non-conforming
portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that such work does not expand or
increase the extent of the non-conformity.
B. Any work required by the codes and ordinances of the City of New London as ordered by
any City official charged with protecting the public health, safety or welfare, if such work
does not enlarge or extend a non-conforming use or otherwise increase any
non-conformity.
Section 750 Conversion or Intensification of Non-Conforming Uses
Other provisions of these Regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, the Commission may
allow by Special Permit a) the conversion of legally nonconforming nonresidential uses to
residential uses is permitted by special permit but is limited to those residential uses otherwise
permitted in the zone, or b) the conversion or intensification of an existing legally nonconforming
commercial use (not including professional offices) to a use or uses that are
substantially similar to the existing non-conforming use. Special Permits under either a) or b)
above shall only be issued upon finding that the proposed use: (Amended 07/24/13)
1) Will not adversely affect the surrounding property or uses for reason of;
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VII-4
a. A change in the character of any structure.
b. Location and character or any proposed activities or operations.
c. Signs, lighting, noise, dust, refuse, odor, traffic congestion or hours of operation.
2) Is not materially different from the established use in terms of impacts, or more
obnoxious to the surrounding neighborhood, and that the proposed use will result in the
non-conforming property being kept in as good or better physical condition; thus,
preserving property values in the surrounding neighborhood;
3) Will result in the preservation of structures or open spaces of historical interest or
importance where applicable;
4) Does not require an increase in the size of the building containing the use or uses.
5) Does not encroach upon areas within the building already used for conforming uses;
6) Meets the other criteria of these Regulations for Special Permits as provided in Section
810.

residential uses, and for all expansions of existing uses, other than single-family
residences, which add 10 percent or more to the floor area, cars generated, parking
spaces, a site plan review and approval by the Commission shall be required before any
zoning permit or building permit may be issued. (Amended 7/90)
All uses requiring a Special Permit or a coastal site plan review (see Article VIII, Section
840) shall require a Site Plan Approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
The Commission shall have the authority to waive the requirement of a site plan and/or
the A-2 survey prescribed in Paragraph H of this Section, below, for changes of use in
existing buildings, if the change of use does not affect existing circulation, drainage,
relationship of buildings to each other, landscaping, buffering, lighting, and other
considerations of site plan review. (Amended 06/28/90)
B. Site Plan Objectives
In reviewing a Site Plan Application, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall take
into consideration the health, safety and welfare of the public in general and the
immediate neighborhood in particular, and may prescribe reasonable conditions and
safeguards to insure the accomplishment of the following general objectives.
1) That the proposed site plan shall be in general conformance with the intent of the
Plan of Development, however, the Plan of Development shall not take
precedence over specific provisions of the Zoning Regulation.
2) That all buildings, structures, uses, equipment, or material are readily accessible
for fire and police protection.
3) That adequate off-street parking and loading spaces are provided to prevent
on-street and off-street traffic congestion; that all parking spaces, maneuvering
areas are suitably identified; that entrances and exits are suitably identified and
designed to specific use radii; that the interior circulation system is adequately
designed to provide safe and convenient access to all structures, uses, and/or
parking spaces; that parking areas are provided with suitable bumper guards,
guard rails, islands, crosswalks, speed bumps and similar safety devices when
deemed necessary to adequately protect life and property; and that provision is
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-2

installation of sidewalks.
4) That all proposed traffic and pedestrian access ways do not create traffic hazards
and are: adequate, but not excessive in number; adequate in width, grade,
alignment, and visibility; adequate in distance from street corners, places of
public assembly and other access ways; and adequate in design for other similar
safety considerations.
5) That the general landscaping of the site complies with the purpose and intent of
this regulation; that existing trees are preserved to the maximum extent possible;
and that parking, storage, refuse and service areas are suitably screened during all
seasons from the view of adjacent residential areas and public rights-of-way.
6) That lighting of the site shall be adequate at ground level for the protection and
safety of the public in regard to pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
That glare from the installation of outdoor lights and illuminated signs is properly
shielded from the view of adjacent property and public rights-of-way.
7) That all utility systems are suitably located, adequately designed, and properly
installed to serve the proposed uses, to protect the property from adverse air,
water, or land pollution.
8) That in planning the layout on the site, and design of structures, consideration is
given to energy conservation.
9) That the development of the site will preserve sensitive environmental land
features such as steep slopes, wetlands, coastal beaches, dunes, other coastal
resources, large rock outcroppings and will attempt to preserve public scenic
views or historically significant features.
10) That the location and size of any proposed use, building or structure, as well as
the nature and intensity of operations involved or conducted in connection
therewith, will be in general harmony with the character of the surrounding
neighborhood, and will not be hazardous or otherwise detrimental to the
appropriate and orderly development or use of any adjacent land, building, or
structure.

Section 830 Flood Plain Management
A. Purpose
The purposes of this regulation is (i) to reduce the threat to public safety and the loss of
property values resulting from periodic flooding within certain areas of the City of New
London, and (ii) to ensure eligibility for continued participation by the City of New
London in the National Flood Insurance Program by establishing policies and permit
requirements related to land use and development in areas of special flood hazard within
the City of New London, consistent with regulations of the National Flood Insurance
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-16
Program, as published in the Federal Register, Volume 41, Number 207, October 26,
1976, as may be amended. (Amended 06/10/11)
B. Flood Hazard Areas
This regulation shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the City of New
London. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for New London
County, Connecticut, dated August 5, 2013, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRM), dated August 5, 2013 (Panels 09011C0363J, 09011C0364J,
09011C0501J, 09011C0502J, 09011C0503J, 09011C0504J, 09011C0511J) and July 18,
2011 (Panel 09011C0482G), and other supporting data applicable to the City of New
London, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this
regulation it must take precedence until such time as a map amendment or map revision
is obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any area shown on the
FIRM as Zones A, AE, and VE, including areas designated as a floodway on the FIRM.
Zone VE is also identified as a Coastal High Hazard Area. Areas of special flood hazard
are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on a Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) are approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the
BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. (Amended 07/24/13)
The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered the minimum
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration and research. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does not imply
or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or uses permitted in such
areas will be free from flooding and flood damages. This regulation shall not create
liability on the part of the City of New London or by any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this regulation or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder. The City of New London, its officers and employees
shall assume no liability for another persons reliance on any maps, data or information
provided by the City of New London. (Amended 06/10/11)
C. Permits Required

VIII-17
D. Requirements
In all special flood hazard areas as shown on the FIRM, the following provisions shall
apply:
1) All new construction and substantial improvements (including the placement of
prefabricated buildings and manufactured homes) shall (i) be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to
flood damage, (iii) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damage, and (iv) electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding. (Amended 11/28/92)
2) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
3) (i) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
system into flood waters, (ii) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and
constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from then during
flooding, and (iii) in any portion of a watercourse which is altered or relocated the
flood carrying capacity shall be maintained. (Amended 11/28/92)
4) In Zones A and AE, new construction or substantial improvement of any
residential use only structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated two-feet above base flood elevation. (Amended 06/10/11)
5) In Zones A and AE, new construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure or structure or mixed use
structure outside the R-1 and R-1A zoning districts shall either: (Amended
06/10/11)
i) have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two-feet above the base
flood elevation; or (Amended 06/10/11)
ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be flood-proofed to one
foot above base flood elevation so that below this level the structure is water
tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are
satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Building Official prior
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-18
to the issuance of a building permit for such structure; or (Amended
06/10/11)
iii) have fully enclosed areas formed by a foundation and other exterior walls
below the base flood elevation (BFE) of an elevated building designed to
preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit
of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls (wet flood-proofing). Designs for complying with this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, or meet the following minimum criteria listed in sections (a)-(g)
below: (Amended 06/10/11)
(a) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings (hydraulic flood vents)
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. These hydraulic
openings must be located on at least two different walls. Only the
area (square footage) that lies below the BFE can be used in the
calculation of net area of vents required. If the structure has more
than one enclosed area, openings must be installed in the exterior
walls of each enclosed area so that flood waters can enter directly
from the outside; (Amended 06/10/11)
(b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot
above the finished grade adjacent to the outside of the foundation
wall. At least one entire side of the structures fully enclosed area
must be at or above grade. Fill placed around the foundation walls
must be graded so that the elevation inside the enclosed area is equal
to or higher than the adjacent outside elevation on at least one side of
the building. The finished floor of the enclosed area shall be no
lower than the bottom of the foundation openings. The foundation
slab of a residential structure, including the slab of a crawlspace,
must be set equal to the outside finished grade on at least one side of
the building; (Amended 06/10/11)
(c) The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters in both directions without any external influence or
control such as human intervention, including the use of electrical and
other non-automatic mechanical means. These coverings must not
block or impede the automatic flow of floodwaters into and out of the
enclosed area. Other coverings may be designed and certified by a
registered professional engineer or approved by the Building Official;
(Amended 06/10/11)
(d) The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the enclosed
area shall be the minimum necessary and shall only be used for the
parking of vehicles, building access or limited storage. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for the parking
of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-19
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry
to the living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not be
used for human habitation or partitioned into separate rooms; (Amended
06/10/11)
(e) All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the BFE
shall be unfinished and resistant to flood damage. (Amended 06/10/11)
(f) Electrical, plumbing, HVAC ductwork, machinery or other utility
equipment and connections that service the structure (including, but not
limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps,
hot water heaters, ventilation, washer and dryer hook-ups, electrical
junction boxes, circuit breaker boxes and food freezers) are prohibited
in the fully enclosed area below the BFE. Utilities or service
equipment located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE
in the space, will subject the structure to increased flood insurance
rates. (Amended 06/10/11)
(g) A residential building with a structurally attached garage having the
floor slab below the BFE is considered an enclosed area below the BFE
and must meet the standards of Sections (a)-(f) above. A garage
attached to a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab
below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters in both directions. Flood openings or vents are
required in the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage doors.
Garage doors that must be manually opened do not meet the flood vent
opening requirements in Sections (a)-(c) above. In addition to the
automatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below BFE must
be constructed with flood resistant materials. Garages attached to nonresidential
structures must also meet the aforementioned requirements
or be dry floodproofed as per the requirements of Section 830 D 5).
(Amended 06/10/11)
6) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
areas of special flood hazards the Building Official shall make the necessary
interpretation.
7) Manufactured homes (mobile homes) shall not be permitted. Recreational
vehicles shall either be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be
fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet all the standards of Section 830
D. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (Amended 06/10/11)
8) When base flood elevation data or flood-way data have not been provided, the
Building Official shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any flood elevation
and flood-way data available from a federal, state or other source in order to
administer the provisions of this regulation. (Amended 11/28/92)
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-20
9) The Building Official shall notify adjacent communities and the Department of
Environmental Protection, Inland Water Resources Division prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Building Official will
assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. (Amended
06/10/11)
10) The Building Official shall obtain, record, and maintain the as-built elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
construction or substantially improved structures, and, the elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved structures have been
flood-proofed. In coastal high hazard areas (VE zones), the Building Official shall
obtain, record and maintain the elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structural member for all new construction or substantially improved structures.
(Amended 06/10/11)
11) The Building Official shall maintain all records pertaining to the provisions of
these regulations. (Amended 11/28/92)
12) Floodways. Located within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are areas
designated as floodways on the communitys Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM).
Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood
waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
repairs to substantially damaged structures and other developments shall be
permitted unless certification, with supporting technical data, by a Connecticut
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice, that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood
levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge published by FEMA. Fences
in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design.
(Amended 06/10/11)
When base flood elevations have been determined within Zone AE on the
communitys flood insurance rate map but a regulatory floodway has not been
designated, the Building Official must require that no new construction,
substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained substantial
damage or other development, including fill, shall be permitted which will
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1.0) foot at
any point within the community when all existing and anticipated development is
considered cumulatively with the proposed development. (Amended 06/10/11)
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-21
The Building Official may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses
without FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant
or whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the
municipalitys request or not), the community shall adopt a regulatory floodway
based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the
base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1.0) foot
at any point within the community. (Amended 06/10/11)
13) Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally
influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the
community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial
improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited
unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer
demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not
result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work
within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to
provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to
cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity. (Amended 06/10/11)
14) Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those
areas that are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by
filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in
footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening
of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been
gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same
hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be
hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of
flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation,
which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume
shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water
body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the
municipality. (Amended 06/10/11)
E. Additional Requirements (Amended 06/10/11)
In all areas designated coastal high hazard zones VE zones on the FIRM the following
provisions shall additionally apply: (Amended 06/10/11)
1) All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide.
2) All new construction or substantial improvements shall be elevated so that the
lowest supporting member is located no lower than two-feet above the base flood
elevation level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open so as not
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-22
to impede the flow of water, except for breakaway walls as provided for in
subsection 8, below. (Amended 06/10/11)
3) All new construction or substantial improvement shall be securely anchored on
pilings or columns.
4) All pilings and columns and the attached structures shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads
acting simultaneously on all building components. The anchoring and support
system shall be designed with wind and water loading values which equal or
exceed the 100 year median recurrence interval (one percent annual chance floods
and winds). (Amended 11/28/92)
5) Compliance with provisions contained in subsections 2, 3 and 4, above, shall be
certified to by a registered professional engineer or architect. (Amended 11/28/92)
6) There shall be no fill used as structural support.
7) There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood
damage.
8) Breakaway walls for new construction or substantial improvements shall be
allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not part of the structural
support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally
high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the
building on which they are to be used.
a) Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall not be less than 10 nor
more than 20 pounds per square foot; or (Amended 11/28/92)
b) If more than 20 pounds per square foot, a registered professional engineer
or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse would occur during
the base flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and
supporting foundation system shall not be subjected to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and
water. (Amended 11/28/92)
9) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall not be used for human
habitation.
10) Prior to construction, plans for any structure that will have breakaway walls must
be submitted to the Building Official for approval.
11) Manufactured homes (mobile homes) shall not be permitted. Recreational
vehicles shall either be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be
ZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON
AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019
VIII-23
fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet all the standards of Section 830
E and the standards of Section 830 D 1)-3). A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions. (Amended 06/10/11)
F. Verification of Building Elevation
The Building Official shall verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved
structures and the actual elevation to which new or substantially improved structures
have been flood-proofed.
G. Variances
Variances to the provisions of this regulation may be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals for the City of New London, in accordance with the following: (Amended
11/28/92)
1) Variances shall be issued only upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause,
(ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of
the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
2) Variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
3) The Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of the Building
Official that (i) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
4) The Board shall (i) maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such variances issued in its biennial
report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Federal
Insurance Administrator. (Amended 06/10/11)

31) Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvements of a
structure, taking place over a ten year period, the cumulative cost of which equals
or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either, (1) before the
start of construction of the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the
structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.
This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage
regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this
definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local
code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions, or (2) any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic
structure.(Amended 07/24/13)
32) Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain
management regulation that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited

AMENDED TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019

and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. (Amended
06/10/11)
33) Violation means a failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the communitys floodplain management ordinance. A structure
or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation
documentation, flood-proofing certificates or required floodway encroachment
calculations is resumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided. (Amended 06/10/11)
34) Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

hearing, close a public hearing, or render a decision, set forth in Sections 360.1 &
360.2, but the total of all extensions together cannot exceed sixty-five (65) days.
(Amended December 4, 2003)
360.3 Endorsement of Plan  If the Commission votes to approve a plan or modify and approve
a plan, its approval, with the date thereof, shall be endorsed and signed by the Chairman
or Secretary of the Commission in the space provided for such purpose on each sheet of a
mylar copy of the plan provided by the applicant within thirty days after the
Commissions approval vote. In addition to the above, the applicant shall provide three
paper copies of the endorsed plan.
The Chairman or Secretary of the Commission shall, when endorsing the plan, indicate
on the plan the date of endorsement and the date by which all improvements shown on
the plan shall be completed, as required in Section 380 below. The endorsed plan shall
be delivered to the applicant for filing promptly after the fifteen (15) day appeal period,
which period commences on the date of publication of the Commissions action to
approve the plan.
360.4 Bond  Prior to endorsement of the plan, the Commission may require from the applicant
a performance bond from a bonding company licensed to conduct business in
Connecticut, or other surety with conditions satisfactory to the Commission securing to
the City of New London the actual construction and installation of improvements
including the construction of streets, granite curbs, sidewalks, drainage features, street
signs, the installation of monuments and markers, the grading and improvement of
recreation facilities, landscaping, cleanup of the premises and measures to be taken to
control soil erosion and sedimentation likely to occur from the proposed subdivision.
The amount of the bond shall be estimated by the applicant who shall provide the
Commission with the basis for the estimate. The Commission shall review the estimate
with the City Engineer prior to approving the amount of the bond. The bond shall be
accepted by the Commission and deposited with the City Treasurer until its release is
voted by the Commission. The bond shall not be released until (1) improvements have
been substantially completed; (2) where new streets are involved, such streets are
certified as completed by the City Engineer; and (3) a period of thirty (30) days has

Before release of the performance bond, a maintenance bond shall be submitted which
shall be in an amount equal to ten percent of the performance bond or $2,500, whichever
amount is greater, and which shall be retained by the City for one year. The purpose of
the maintenance bond is to guarantee correction of any construction failures related to the
subdivision.
360.5 Conditional Approval  In lieu of either the completion of the work of the furnishing of a
bond as provided in these Regulations, the Commission may authorize the filing of a plan
with a conditional approval endorsed thereon. Such approval shall be conditioned on (1)
the actual construction, maintenance and installation of any improvements of utilities
prescribed by the Commission, or (2) the provisions of a bond as provided by these
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Page 8 of 24
S:\SubdivisionRegs\Regulations(AmendedTo061011).DOC
Regulations. Upon the occurrence of either of such events, the Commission shall cause a
final approval to be endorsed on the subdivision plan in the manner provided in these
Regulations. Any conditional approval shall lapse five years from date it is granted. Any
person, firm or corporation who, prior to such final approval, sells or offers for sale any
lot subdivided pursuant to a conditional approval shall be fined not more than $500.00 for
each lot sold or offered for sale.
Section 370 Filing the Plan
The endorsed mylar copy of the plan shall be filed by the applicant in the office of the City Clerk
and any plan not so filed within ninety (90) days of the date such plan is delivered to the
applicant or within ninety (90) days of the date upon which such plan is taken as approved by
reason of the failure of the Commission to act, shall become null and void, except that upon
request by the applicant, the Commission may extend the time for such filing for as long as two
additional periods of ninety (90) days, and the plan shall remain valid until the expiration of such
extended time. No such plan shall be filed or recorded by the City Clerk until its approval has
been endorsed in writing on such plan by the Chairman or Secretary of the Commission.
Section 380 Time Limit on Completion of Work
Any person, firm or corporation making any subdivision of land shall complete all work in
connection with such subdivision within five years after the Commissions vote to approve the
plan for such subdivision, which completion date shall be noted on the plan by the Chairman or
Secretary of the Commission at the time of endorsement of the approved plan. Failure to
complete all work within such five year period shall result in automatic expiration of the
approval of such plan, provided the Commission shall file on the land records of the City of New
London notice of such expiration on the subdivision plan on file in the Office of the City Clerk,
and no additional lots shall be conveyed in the subdivision by the subdivider or his successor in
interest as such subdivider, except with approval by the Commission of a new application for
subdivision of the subject land. If lots have been conveyed during such five year period, the
Commission shall call the bond or other surety on said subdivision to the extent necessary to
complete the work required to serve those lots. Work for purposes of this section means all
physical improvements required by the approval of the plan, other than the staking out of lot, and
includes, but is not limited to, the construction of roads, storm drainage facilities and water and
sewer lines, the setting aside of open space and recreation areas, installation of telephone and
electrical services and street lights, planting of trees or other landscaping, and installation of

subsequently built on them. As a general rule, lot arrangements should enable principal
buildings to be situated so that their longest axis lies in an east/west direction, so as to
expose the front or rear of the building to the south.
Section 530 Streets
All streets shall conform to the following:
530.1 All proposed streets and rights-of-way shall be in harmony with existing or proposed
thoroughfares as shown on the master plan. All proposed streets shall have a minimum
right-of-way width of 50 feet.
530.2 Subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not conform to widths as
shown on the master plan, shall dedicate additional width along either one or both sides
of said street. If the subdivision is along one side only, one-half of the required extra
width shall be dedicated.
530.3 The arrangement of streets not shown on the master plan shall be such as to provide the
appropriate extension of existing streets. No privately-owned reserved strip shall be
permitted which controls access to any part of the subdivision from any street or other
open space dedicated to public use, or which may be so dedicated.

alteration of the natural land contour in a manner that would aggravate natural drainage
or cause erosion and sedimentation problems that would be difficult to control or correct.
610.4 A subdivision design standard would impair maximum access to the sun for solar energy
on one or more lots in the subdivision.
610.5 A required subdivision plan ingredient may be waived if the Commission finds it will not
contribute to an understanding of the subdivision and its proposed improvements.
610.6 Physical limitations exist that severely limit the ability of the applicant to meet the design
requirements of these Regulations.

Section 615 Signs
All of Section 615 of the Zoning Regulations (Signs) including the illustration found on page VI-
45 are hereby deleted and the following is inserted in its place. (Amended 08/23/99)
A. Purpose and Intent
1) The purpose of this section of the zoning regulations is to promote, preserve,
enhance and protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the City by
regulating signs of all types on public and private property through the
establishment of standards to control the location, number, size, height,
maintenance and character of signs. The indiscriminate construction, erection and
maintenance of signs can create undue distractions to motorists and pedestrians,
may tend to depreciate property values and may be detrimental to the preservation
and enhancement of the aesthetic and historical values of the City. These
regulations are intended to:
a) Provide specific and enforceable standards to protect the community.
b) Protect property values.
c) Encourage the installation of signs that assist in the creation of a more
attractive economic and business climate so that travelers, visitors, residents
and business people patronize the Citys commercial establishments.
d) Enhance and protect the aesthetic appearance and historical heritage of the
City.
e) Provide adequate identification, communication and advertising for land uses.
f) Distinguish between the Citys various zoning districts and the desired
character and development patterns of each district.
g) Ensure that signs are compatible with their surroundings.
2) In evaluating all sign applications, the Planning & Zoning Commission (PZC) and
the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) shall insure that the sign:
a) Reduces distractions, confusion and obstructions that may contribute to unsafe
traffic conditions.
b) Minimizes the adverse effect on adjacent property and the general public.
c) Reduces hazards that may be caused by signs overhanging or projecting over
public rights-of-way.
d) Improves the appearance of the City.

SECTION l TITLE & AUTHORITY
1.1. The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable
and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have
been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential
to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and
control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to
the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetland and
watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated
use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or
obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have
despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity
has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and
ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the
environment, thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational
values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation
and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable
and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to
the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of
these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the
protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by
minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in
accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing
damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial
aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats
thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality
of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and
other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water
supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement
by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state
and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to
forever guarantee to the people of the city, the safety of such natural resources for their
benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2. These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations
of the City of New London".
1.3. The New London Conservation Commission was authorized by the Council of the City of
New London in an ordinance amending the Code of Ordinances, adopted on May 4,
1981, to adopt and administer inland wetland regulations.
1.4. These regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in
accordance with the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these
regulations.
1.5. The Commission shall enforce all provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Act and shall issue, issue with modifications, and deny permits for all regulated activities

· Under the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, Connecticut's municipalities regulate proposed
development activities in or affecting wetlands and watercourses. In support of the municipal
wetland agencies, DEP' s Wetlands Management Section provides a comprehensive Wetlands
Management Training Program for wetland agency commissioners and Model Regulations for
local inland wetland programs. Guidelines for Uplm1d Review Area Regulations was published in
accordance with sections 22a-42(d) and 22a-42a(f) of the General Statutes to assist Connecticut's
inland wetland agencies in developing and implementing municipal regulations for activities
proposed on uplands around wetlands or watercourses.
The guide was drafted in response to inquires from wetland agency members, river management
groups, the regulated community, and other interest persons, for guidance in implementing what
are popularly called buffer or setback provisions in wetland regulations. The guide uses the term
upland review area to describe the non-wetland or non-watercourse area in which certain types of
activities, as defined in municipal regulations, are regulated activities. Other terms for describing
this area are used in municipal regulations. We selected the term upland review area because it
best conveys the regulatory scheme under the inland wetlands statues wherein a wetland agency
reviews regulated activities case-by-case and approves or disapproves them on their merits.

Guidelines for Upland Review Area Regulations
Under Connecticut's Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act
Wetlands and Uplands: an Introduction
The relationship between a wetland or waterc~mrse and its surrounding upland is complex.
Upland land clearing, excavating, filling and other construction activities if not properly planned
and executed can have significant impacts on adjacent wetlands and watercourses. Under the
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, the municipal wetlands agency has broad authority to issue
pennits not only for activities in wetlands or watercourses themselves, but for activities located
elsewhere when such activities are likely to impact or affuct wetlands or watercourses. It is the
depaitment 's policy to encourage municipal wetland agencies to review proposed activities
located in upland areas sun'Olmdingwetlands and watercourses wherever such activities are
likely to impact or affect wetlands orwatercourses.1
An understanding of how certain activities in upland areas affect wetlands and watercourses has
led most towns to adopt regulations requiring wetland agency review of proposed development
adjacent to wetlands and watercourses.2 Such regulations are optional under the Act, but serve to
infonn the public as to the circumstances under which a wetlands permit is required of activities
proposed adjacent to a wetland or watercourse. 3
While requiring a permit for specified activities within defined upland review area boundaries.
these wetland agencies still maintain their authority to regulate proposed actiyities located in more
distant upland areas if they find that the activities are likely to impact or affect a wetland or
watercourse.
The purpose of these guidelines is to assist municipal wetlands agencies to review and revise their
wetlands and watercourses regulations, if necessary. As such, the guidelines provide a foundation
for consistency in municipal regulations and permitting activities. They are not intended to
substitute for reasoned evaluation and judgement by municipal wetlands agencies of the local
wetland and watercourse resources, the conditions surrounding those resources, and the types of
activities which are likely to impact or affect those resources. Nor are they intended to guide
wetlands agencies through the decision making process for acting on permits. Both these topics
are more appropriately addressed in detail through the department's Inland Wetlands Management
Training Program for wetland agency commissioners and their staff. Wetlands agencies are
reminded that they should review proposed changes in their inland wetlands and watercourses
regulations with their town attorney.

Model Municipal Upland Review Area Regulations
In addition to implementing the law to protect wetlands and watercourses, regulations inform the
public on what to expect if one proposes an activity in or affecting a wetland or watercourse in the
subject town. Upland review area regulations reduce or eliminate the need for case-by-case rulings
by providing notice as to what activities need wetland permits. By specifying where a permit is
required, such regulations foster consistency and are convenient for the public. In determining the
boundaries for its upland review area regulations, the wetland agency should consider the specific
kinds of development activities on uplands which are likely to impact or affect wetlands and
watercourses and the nature of that impact or affect.
An upland activity which is likely to impact or affect wetlands or watercourses is a regulated
activity and should be identified as such in the regulations. In identifying upland review area
regulated activities, the wetlands agency must apply the standard established under section 22a·
42a(f) of the General Statutes and find that the activity is" ... likely to impact or affect wetlands or
watercourses."4 Examples of upland regulated activities are included in the models below. In
implementing its upland review area regulations, the wetland agency must be cognizant that
certain proposed activities, which are permitted uses as ofright or as nonregulated uses under
section 22a-40 of the General Statutes, are not regulated and do not require a permit from the
wetlands agency under the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act.
There are a number of ways that the boundaries of an upland review area may be defined in
regulations. In selecting its approach, the wetland agency should consider the special nature of
their town's wetland and watercourse resources, the purposes and intent of the Inland Wetlands
and Watercourses Act, and how the regulations will be implemented.
Three models for upland review area regulations are presented below. The first model provides
that certain specified activities if conducted within a specified distance measured from any
wetland or watercourse are regulated activities. As such, the first model is the basic model and
easiest to implement. The second model expands upon that basic model by identifying specific
wetland and watercourse resources of special concern and providing site specific review area
widths for those resources. This model should be used where the wetland agency believes
additional protection though a wider review area is needed or to take existing land development or
uses into account with a narrower review area. The third model adds to the basic model a slope
and soil fuctor in determining the site specific width or location of the upland review area. The
first and second models are easily understood and implemented, while the third is technically
complex and not easily implemented without trained staff.
Note that the first sentence of each model definition below is the definition of the term regulated
activity taken from section 22a-38(13) of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and, as such,
its meaning may not be changed in municipal inland wetlands regulations.

Considerations in Establishing Upland Review Areas
Regulated Activities
The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act (Sections 22a-36 through 22a-45a of the General
Statutes) defines 1·egulated activity to mean:
" ... any operation within or use of a wetland or watercourse involving the removal or deposition
of material, or any obstruction, construction, alteration or pollution of such wetlands or
watercourses, but shall not include the specified activities in section 22a-40 of the Connecticut
General Statutes. " 8
In addition to activities located in a wetland or watercourse, any activity located in a non-wetland
or non-watercourse area which is likely to impact or affect a wetland or watercourse may be
deemed to be a regulated activity (unless the activity is a use permitted as of right or as a
nonregulated activity). However, the likelihood of an activity having a substantive impact on a
wetland or watercourse will depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the wetland or
watercourse, the activity, soils and slope of the land, and would generally decrease with increasing
distance of the activity from the wetland or watercourse. At some point, impacts from that activity
on wetlands and watercourses would be expected to become de minimis and not measurable.
The DEP believes that a 100 foot-wide upland review area is sufficient for reviewing construction
Bureau ofWaterMa.nage1nent
IWRD-WM-GUIDE/Review Page 4. June 1997
activities in areas surrounding wetlands or watercourses because most of the activities which are
likely to impact or affect these resources will be located in that area. However, based on the
special factors of concern to a wetlands agency, e.g., wetland and watercourse values, slope, soils,
existing development, etc., a greater or lesser distance may be appropriate for a particular
municipality. However, beyond l 00 feet it is neither practical nor desirable, from a wetlands and
watercourses management perspective, to automatically require an inland wetlands permit for all
construction activities. It must be emphasized that other municipal authorities and mechanisms
involving planning, zoning and subdivision decisions and plans of conservation and development,
play a role in addressing the broader watershed issues.
Upland Review Areas, Setbacks ant! Buffers
In a number of municipal inland wetlands regulations, upland review areas are referred to as
setbacks or buffers.9 We chose the term upland review area to describe the non-wetland or nonwatercourse
area in which certain activities would be regulated because it best conveys the
regulatory scheme under the wetlands statutes wherein a wetland agency reviews regulated
activities case-by-case and approves or disapproves them on their merits. The inland wetland
statutes do not authorize a blanket prohibition of all activities either in the wetlands or in upland
review, buffer or setback areas.
Use of Upland Review Area Regulations
Most municipal wetland agencies have already adopted some form of upland review area
regulations.10 Such regulations are based on a presumption that the regulated activity will have an
adverse impact on the adjacent wetland or watercourse. A person proposing to conduct a regulated
activity has the burden to demonstrate to the wetlands agency that the impacts of his proposal are
consistent with the purposes and provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and,
therefore, that he is entitled to the permit. An applicant who successfully documents to the
satisfaction of the wetlands agency that his proposed activities are fully consistent with the
purposes and provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act is entitled to receive a
permit. The factors the wetlands agency must consider in making its decision on the application
are prescribed in section 22a-41 of the General Statutes. 11
Tlte Role of the Upland Review Area in Protecting Wetlands amt Watercourses
Upland areas surrounding wetlands or watercourses function in a number of ways to protect these
resources. An understanding of these functions and how they potentially may be impacted by
construction activity or development is necessary for the wetlands agency to adopt an upland
review area and subsequently regulate activities therein. Since the functions will vary depending
on the specific project site, each permit application will be different and must be reviewed 011 its
individual merits.

Determining Upland Review Area Boundaries
Due to the variability of Connecticut's landscape features, even within the same watershed, and the
multiplicity ofregulated activities which may be involved in site development, it is not practical to
establish separate upland review area boundary distances for each category or type of regulated
activity. Instead, the upland review area should be of sufficient width to ensure that it will
encompass the activities that are most likely to impact or affect the adjacent wetlands or
watercourses. It is recommended that upland review area boundaries be delineated using a
uniform distance measured horizontally and perpendicular from the ordinary high water mark ofa
lake, pond, river or stream or from a wetland soil boundary.
The upland review area width adopted by the wetlands agency may be wider or narrower than the
100 foot width recommended by DEP. DEP encourages municipal wetlands agencies base their
upland review area widths giving due consideration to local landscape factors including the value,
or importance, of wetland or watercourse resources, extent of existing land use and, if a wetland
agency deems it to be practicable, on the slope and soils of the land to be developed or other
factors.
To be enforceable, the upland review areas must be adopted in the town's inland wetlands and
watercourses regulations following the procedures described under section 22a-42a of the General
Statutes.12 Importantly, the upland review area regulations must be easy to understand by a
property owner and easy to implement by the inland wetlands agency (should it need to take an
enforcement action), as well as by any other interested person.
A uniform review area width has the advantage of simplicity over a variable width in that it is
easier to delineate, understand and administer. The disadvantage of a variable, non-uniform, width
upland review area regulation is that its inherent complexity may make the regulation difficult to
establish and subsequently administer. Ordinarily, the agency will need a professional staff person
to delineate and enforce variable upland review area regulations. Also, citizens may be confused
using a variable approach and disagreements over the actual location on the ground of the outer
limit of the upland review area may complicate permit and enforcement proceedings. Verification
of the upland review area location is particularly important in an enforcement action where the
burden is on the agency to prove that there is a violation of its regulations. For these reasons, the
department urges caution in adopting complex upland review area boundaries (e.g., Model Option
ill, above).
While it is desirable for upland review areas to be depicted on the town's official inland wetlands
and watercourses map, depending on the type ofreview area adopted, actual mapping may not be
necessary provided appropriate narrative description is included in the town's inland wetlands and
watercourses regulations and such provisions are clearly referenced on the official map.
Wetlands agency regulations governing wetlands maps and the official wetlands maps themselves
should state that such wetlands and watercourses maps were prepared for information purposes
only and that the actual character of the land shall govern the agency's jurisdiction thereon. The
Bureau of Water Manage1nent
IWRD-WM-GUIDEIReview Page 9. June 1997
official wetlands and watercourses maps should also clearly reference or depict all upland review
areas which have been adopted by the agency.
Boundary Factors
There are a number of factors which should be considered in defining upland review area
boundaries. For unique situations, such as with an important bog, the boundary of the review area
could be set by using an elevation contour encompassing the subject area. In addition, upland
review areas may be wider or narrower for specified wetlands or watercourses. For example, an
upland review area for a significant wetland or watercourse habitat or for wetlands and
watercourses located in a public water supply watershed could be set wider than a review area for
wetlands or watercourses located in other less critical areas.
*Significant Wetland and Watercourse Resources
All wetlands have intrinsic value, some wetland areas being more or Jess ecologically
valuable than others. But if a wetland or watercourse is known to be ecologically
significant, or to have a critical function or valne such as in flood control or as habitat for
an endangered species, a wider, more protective, upland review area may be appropriate.
Unique wetland and watercourse values such as in research, education or recreation may
also warrant a wider upland review area.
DEP encourages all towns to evaluate their wetlands resources. To that end, DEP offers
training guidance on a methodology for identifying the relative importance of the wetlands
and watercourses in a town or within a watershed. (See: DEP Bulletin # 9 Nfethod for the
. Evaluation of Inland Wetlands in Connecticut, 1989 13
) This methodology uses
mathematical and word expressions to assign relative "wetland value units" (WVU) to a
number of the common wetland and watercourse functions. The following functions are
defined in DEP Bulletin #9:
-Flood Control
-Ecological Integrity
-Wildlife Habitat
-Fish Habitat
-Nutrient Retention and Sediment Trapping
-Education Potential
-Visual!Esthetic Quality
-Agricultural Potential
-Forestry Potential
-Water Based Recreation
-Ground-water Use Potential
-Shoreline Anchoring and Dissipation of Erosive Forces
-Noteworthiness, including public water supply watersheds
Bureau of Water Manage111ent
JWRD-WM-GUIDEIReview Page 10. June 1997
In addition, guidance on vernal pools is provided in a recent publication by the
Connecticut Forest Stewardship Program and the University of Connecticut Cooperative
Extension System titled Identification and Protection of Vernal Pool Wetlands of
Connecticut. Both of the above referenced publications are available from the DEP
Bookstore, 79 Elm Street, Hartford, phone 860-424-3555.
*Slope
By enlarging the width of the upland review area in proportion to its slope upward from the
wetland or watercourse, the wetland agency may have a better opportunity to protect
wetlands and watercourses from sedimentation originating from upland construction
activities. For example, wherever the minimum 100 foot upland review area slope exceeds
5%, regulations could add 5 feet (or other reasonable measure) of review area distance
horizontally for each 1 % increase in slope. Thus, if the basic 100 foot wide review area
has a 15% slope upward from the ordinary high water line or wetland soil boundary, an
additional 50 feet would be added to the horizontal width of the upland review area
(5ftfl % x 10% = 50ft). Similarly, where the land slopes away (downward) from the
regulated area, e.g., as in the case of a hill-side seep wetland, the width of the review area
could be reduced.
In general, the greater the slope of the land being developed, the greater the potential threat
of damage to adjacent wetlands and watercourses from erosion and sedimentation.
However, in practice, unless a town already has good town-wide topographic mapping,
calculating a slope parameter for a town-wide map of the upland review area boundary
would require considerable professional engineering expertise.
A practical approach to using the slope factor may be for wetland agencies to assert their
jurisdiction case-by-case over major construction activities on any steeply sloped areas
located outside the upland review area where wetlands and watercourses may be threatened
by sedimentation caused by erosion at upland construction sites. Such sedimentation is
deemed to be pollution and may be cause for an enforcement action under the inland
wetlands statutes (see definition of regulated activity above).
* Soils
Combined with slope, the type of soil found adjacent to wetlands and watercourses is an
important factor in how development may affect adjacent wetlands or watercourses. Soil
characteristics such as texture, cohesiveness and organic content influence the creation of
rill and gully formation as a result of erosion by water. In turn, this creates a potential for
sedimentation of adjacent wetlands and watercourses. The United States Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, has compiled lists of highly erodible
soil map units which can be located using their published soil surveys. While these lists
were compiled primarily for agricultural applications, they may also be useful in evaluating
the erosion potential from construction activity.
Bureau of Water Management
IWRD-WM-GUIDE/Review Page 11. June 1997
Also, the permeability of a particular soil, the rate at which groundwater travels through a
soil, is an important consideration when evaluating the potential for an upland review area
to renovate wastewater discharges to the ground water that may subsequently discharge to a
wetland or watercourse. This may be an important consideration when septic system
leaching fields or storm water infiltration trenches are proposed adjacent to wetlands or
watercourses.
For more information on highly erodible soils, refer to Highly Erodible Soil Map Units of
Connecticut, USDA-NRCS (1986). For more information on soil permeability
characteristics, contact your local USDA-Natural Resource Conservation Service Center
(call 860-487-4011 for the center near you). Information on ground-water as it relates to
sewage treatment can be found in Seepage and Pollutant Renovation (DEP Bulletin # 7)
and Canying Capacity of Public Water Supply Watersheds (DEP Bulletin# 11 ).
Except when soils are used to define wetlands, regulation of development based on soil
characteristics is largely a responsibility of the town sanitarian and the planning and zoning
commission(s).14 However, where highly erodible soils are located adjacent to wetlands
and watercourses, erosion and sedimentation control is especially critical and should also
be addressed by the wetland agency.
Upland review area boundaries based on soil characteristics should be depicted as such on
the official inland wetlands and watercourses map for the subject town.
 Floodplain Limits
The landward boundary of a mapped floodplain, such as delineated by the 100-year flood
mapped by the National Flood Insurance Program, has been determined using a theoretical
design flood on the subject watercourse. Mapped flood limits have no direct relation to
the location of wetlands or smaller watercourses on the floodplain. Also, the floodplain
boundaries for most small watercourses have not been mapped. For these reasons, flood
insurance floodplain maps may not reflect a reasonable boundary of the upland review area.
*Urban Areas and Existing Development
Existing development of the area surrounding wetlands and watercourses has, more likely
than not, already had an impact on the upland area's ability to protect those resources.
Degraded conditions should not be used to justify further degradation. The wetlands or
watercourses themselves may have been filled or modified for storm water or flood control.
For these reasons any remaining fringe of undisturbed area between the wetland or
watercourse and existing upland development may be all that there is to buffer adjacent
water resources from further degradation from new development. In such urban areas,
particular attention should be given to how storm water discharges are managed so as to
minimize the opportunity for pollution and alteration of wetland or watercourse habitats.
Bureau of Water Management
IWRD-WM-GUIDE/Review Page 12. June 1997
New development in urban areas that contain degraded wetlands or watercourses, may
provide an opportunity to improve these degraded resources while mitigating the impact of
the new development. This can be accomplished by habitat restoration or enhancement or
by using storm water management system retrofits that are designed to improve the quality
of the storm water discharge.
Endnotes
1. This document was prepared in response to inquiries from municipal wetland commissioners, the
Rivers Advisory Committee, the regulated community and other interested persons for guidance on
implementing setback and buffer provisions in municipal regulations adopted under Connecticut's
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act. Section 22a-42d of the General Statutes directs the department
to provide guidance for the implementation of Section 22a-42a(f) of the General Statutes.
2. Over 80% of Connecticut's municipal wetlands agencies have regulations governing regulated
activities in areas surrounding wetlands or watercourses.
3. Section 22a-42a(c)(2) of the General Statutes provides that a wetlands agency may delegate approval
authority for non-significant activities proposed in upland review areas to its agent provided such agent
has had DEP training.
4. Section 22a-42a(f) provides that the wetlands agency has jurisdiction over those activities proposed
in the upland review area which are " ... likely to impact or affect wetlands or watercourses." In
documenting the necessity for regulating specific activities conducted in upland review areas, it is not
sufficient to merely assert that the activity "may" impact or affect wetlands or watercourses.
5. ContactDEP for a copy oflnland Wetlands and Watercourses Model Regulations. DEP'sModel
Regulations provide a comprehensive guide for implementing the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Act through municipal wetland agency regulations. Model Regulations is updated as needed to reflect
current legislation.
6. "Ordinary high water mark'' means a mark on the land caused by the presence and action of water,
which presence and action is so common and usual and so long continued in all ordinary years so as to
mark upon the land a distinction between the abutting upland and the watercourse. Such mark may be
found by examining the bed and bank of any watercourse and ascertaining thereon an abrupt change in
the characteristics of soil or vegetation or slope of the land. This term should be defined in municipal
wetlands regulations.
7. Percent slope is most simply determined by dividing the difference in elevation between two points
by the distance between the points (i.e., rise/run) and multiplying the result by 100. If a slope factor is
used in regulations, the regulations must provide guidance as to how the slope should be measured in
the field e.g., on shortest straight line transect from any wetland or watercourse boundary to the highest
up gradient point on the land to be developed; number and location of transects; and, in recognition that
Bureau of Water Manage1nent
IWRD-WM-GUIDE/Review Page 13. June 1997
the actual slope of the land is not uniform, methods for averaging of slope over a site.
8. In implementing upland review area regulations, the wetlands agency must be cognizant of the "uses
as of right" provisions of section 22a-40 of the General Statutes. Under section 22a-40, certain activities
are uses of wetland and watercourses as of right or as a nonregulated use. Such uses are not regulated
and do not require a permit from the wetland agency. For example, subdivision ( 4) of section 22a-40(a)
prescribes that certain" ... uses incidental to the enjoyment and maintenance ofresidential property ... "
are permitted as of right: "( s ]uch uses· shall include maintenance of existing structures and landscaping
but shall not include removal or deposition of significant amounts of material from or onto a wetland or
watercourse or diversion or alteration of a watercourse." Other uses permitted as of right include certain
agricultural and forestry uses, boat anchorage and mooring, certain water company activities and
maintenance of drainage pipes which pre-date the regulations. Nonregulated uses include a number of
conservation and recreational activities. Persons proposing such uses should seek confirmation from
the municipal wetlands agency that their proposed project does not require a permit.
9. DEP has not adopted an upland review area provision for state agency actions because, unlike
municipal wetland agencies which have only one opportunity to review a project, DEP has a number of
opportunities during both planning and permitting of state agency projects. DEP reviews state agency
projectS under the Environmental Policy Act (Findings of No Significant Impact, Environmental Impact
Statements) and several permit programs under Title 22a and 25 of the General Statutes. As partners in
state government, state agencies generally act cooperatively to address environmental issues. Utilizing
its technical resources, the State strives to apply site specific best management practices during the
different planing and regulatory reviews.
10. Depending on the wetland agency, upland review area widths range from 25 feet up to 650 feet from
wetland or watercourse boundaries.
11. Section 22a-41 of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act established the criteria for decision on
permit applications as follows: In carrying out the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45,
inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to regulating, licensing and
enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all relevant fucts and
circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. the environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or
watercourses;
b. the applicant's purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed
regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to
wetlands or watercourses;
c. the relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the proposed regulated
activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;
d. irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be
caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity
would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any
mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such
Bureau of Water Managen1ent
IWRD-WM-GUJDE/Review Page 14. June 1997
activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or
other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or
(3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or
watercourse resources;
e. the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the reasonable
use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity; and
f impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area
for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably
related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed
regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands or watercourses.
Additionally, if the wetlands agency holds a hearing because it found that the subject activity may have
a significant impact; the wetlands agency may not grant the permit unless it finds that the activity is
acceptable under the criteria listed above and that there is no less environmentally damaging feasible
and prudent alternative.
12. Under Section 22a-42a(b) of the General Statutes, the wetlands agency must provide the DEP with a
copy of notice of its hearing on proposed regulations and a copy of the proposed regulations no less than
3 S days prior to the hearing thereon. DEP must review and approve all proposed wetland agency
regulations except proposed map revisions.
13. The methodology described in DEP Bulletin #9 is a resource planning tool intended to be used for
town-wide or watershed-wide assessments of wetland resources and is not designed to be used by
applicants or wetlands agencies to evaluate the significance of the impact of activities proposed in
permit applications.
14. Section 22a-329 of the General Statues provides that regulations adopted by a municipality pursuant
to CGS Secs. 8-2 and 8-25 shall require that proper provisions be made for soil erosion and sediment
control.
