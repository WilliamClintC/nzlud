construction of such improvements by a Completion Bond or other security acceptable to the community; and
WHEREAS, desires to construct a (residential) (commercial (industrial) development within the Village of Sugar Grove, Illinois and that said municipality is willing to accept an
undertaking from a financial institution in the nature of an irrevocable commitment in lieu of such Completion Bond,
NOW, THEREFORE, are the following representations made by the owner and/or developer to the Village of Sugar Grove, as follows:
1. That is the owner and/or developer of the property legally described in Clause 2 of this undertaking, and shall hereinafter be referred to as "Owner"; and, that the Village of Sugar
Grove shall hereinafter be referred to as “Village”.

drainage systems, water lines, common landscaping in common areas and grading, restoration, professional fees (legal, engineering, planning and other related fees) required to be expended by
the Village both before and during construction of said development and collection of the amount specified in the approved Letter of Credit in the event of a default under said Letter of Credit, and
a sufficient amount to cover a one year warranty in the event an adequate substitute security is not submitted for said warranty period (hereinafter “Public Improvements”). All improvements shall
be in accordance with the standards, specifications and requirements of the Village.
In order to guarantee that such facilities shall be installed, the Owner shall submit to the Village Engineer such specifications and estimated engineering costs as shall be required to meet with his
approval. In aiding the Village Engineer in determining the amount of reasonably anticipated costs for the construction of such improvements, the Owner may submit to the engineer signed
contracts for the construction of such improvements. The Village Engineer, upon determining that the design of the required improvements are in accordance with good engineering practices,
shall estimate and certify an amount which shall represent one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the reasonably estimated cost of completing those improvements and for which amount the
Municipality requires the posting of a completion guarantee.
4. That the Owner shall furnish qualified field supervision of the installation of all public improvements in the person of a professional engineer registered and licensed in the State of Illinois.
5. That the Owner shall not be entitled to the recording of the final plat or the issuance of Building Permits until and unless said Owner shall submit to the Village an irrevocable financial commitment

recommendation.

otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the
ground that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the passage or adoption of such motion, then in such case a motion to
reconsider may be made and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such question to be reconsidered, so long as the issue
presented is the same, no new information is forthcoming, and the rights of third parties have not intervened. (Ord. 316, 3-8-1982)

5-2-7: MARIJUANA (CANNABIS) RELATED VIOLATIONS:
5-2-7-1: DECLARATION OF POLICY AND AUTHORITY:
A. Declaration Of Policy: The Board of Trustees recognizes that: 1) the current state of scientific and medical knowledge concerning the effects of
cannabis is at best divided with respect to the damage which is incumbent upon the use of cannabis, and 2) the use of cannabis occupies the unusual
position of being widely used and pervasive among the citizens of Illinois despite the warnings of possible harmful effects, and 3) previous legislation
enacted to control or forbid the use of cannabis has often unnecessarily and unrealistically drawn a large segment of our population within the criminal
justice system without succeeding in deterring the expansion of cannabis use, and 4) the problems created by the use of cannabis are often local in
scope and best dealt with on a local level. It is, therefore, the policy of the Board of Trustees for the Village, in the interest of the health and welfare of
the citizens of the Village, to establish a reasonable penalty system which is responsive to the current state of knowledge concerning cannabis and
which directs the greatest efforts of law enforcement agencies toward the accumulation of more definitive knowledge concerning the use of cannabis,
toward the education of the public with regard to the possible dangers inherent in the use of cannabis and toward the prevention of commercial
traffickers in cannabis.
B. Declaration Of Authority: The Board of Trustees bases the authority of the instant section upon the traditional police powers granted to municipalities
within the State of Illinois, and as well upon the statutory authorities enumerated in 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes, including, but not by limitation, 5/11-5-
3 with regard to preventing intoxication, 5/11-60-2 with regard to preventing nuisances, 5/11-42-9 with respect to offensive businesses, 5/11-20-2 with
respect to beverages and food sold for human consumption, 5/11-20-3 with respect to food and tobacco sold for human consumption, 5/11-20-6 with
respect to destruction of weeds and 5/11-20-5 pertaining to the promotion of health, and those implied powers which are necessary and proper to carry
out the statutorily expressed powers. Further, the Board of Trustees recognizes that it may exercise police powers on the same subject as exercised by
the State so long as the exercise by the Village is not inconsistent with that of the State, and accordingly adopts this section in conformance with the
principles announced in Village of Winnetka v. Sinnett, 272 Ill. App. 143; Village of Mt. Prospect v Malouf, 103 Ill. App. 2d 88; and Waller v Florida, 25
L.Ed.2d 435. (Ord. 228, 11-9-1976)

B. Imposition Of Administrative Penalty: The following shall apply to the administrative penalty imposed for costs pursuant to subsection A of this section:
1. All administrative penalties and towing and storage charges shall be imposed on the registered owner of the motor vehicle or the agent of that
owner.
2. The fees shall be in addition to:
a. Any other penalties that may be assessed by a court of law for the underlying violation; and
b. Any towing or storage fees or both, charged by the towing company.
3. The administrative penalty shall be collected by the towing firm and paid to the Village within ten (10) days of payment being received by the towing
firm.
4. The towing or storage fees, or both, shall be collected by and paid to the towing firm that tows and stores the impounded vehicles.
5. The towing firm shall keep detailed records regarding vehicles towed hereunder, rates charged, fees and penalties paid, and amounts received. Said
records shall be available for inspection by the Police Department upon two (2) days' request by the Police Department.
C. Notice: Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the
police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the Village. Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer
shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation, of the fact of the seizure of the vehicle and of owner's right to request an administrative hearing, as provided for in subsection D of this
section. Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the administrative hearing, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the Village a
cash bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and pays the towing and storage charges. (Ord. 2013-01-22A, 1-22-2013)
D. Preliminary And Full Hearing: The Police Chief shall designate from time to time a person within the Police Department as a preliminary Hearing Officer.
Within twenty four (24) hours of any vehicle being seized and impounded pursuant to this section, if requested by any owner of record, lessee, or any
lienholder of record, the Police Department shall conduct a preliminary hearing at which time said owner of record, lessee, or any lienholder of record
may present any evidence said person desires which would demonstrate a defense to said seizure and impoundment. If the Police Department
determines that said evidence supports such a defense, the Police Department may release said vehicle without further process. If the Police
Department determines that said evidence does not support such a defense, then the Police Department shall deny said preliminary hearing and
proceed as outlined in the remainder of this section.
Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the Village shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested,
the owner of record, lessee, and any lienholder of record at the address which the interested party is registered with the Secretary of State, of the date,
time, and location of the administrative hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this section. The initial administrative hearing shall be scheduled for
not more than forty five (45) days after the date the above notice is mailed. Notice by certified mail need not be given when the owner of record of the
motor vehicle, any lessee and any lienholder of record have been personally served with notice, in written form, of the time, date and location of the
hearing. The owner of record, any lessee, and any lienholder of record shall appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of
guilty is entered, the case will be disposed of at that time. If the owner of record, any lessee or any lienholder of record pleads not guilty, a final hearing
shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the Hearing Officer, no later than forty five (45) days after the initial administrative hearing.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 140/461
All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date, the Hearing Officer may,
at the request of either party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing,
and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. After
the hearing, the Hearing Officers shall issue a written decision either sustaining or overruling the vehicle impoundment. If the Hearing Officer
determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with a violation set forth in this section, the Hearing Officer shall
enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the Village for an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative penalty to the Village (or to the towing
firm) plus fees to the towing firm for the towing and storage of the vehicle. If the owner of record, any lessee and any lienholder of record fails to appear
at the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall enter a default order in favor of the Village. If the Hearing Officer finds that no such violation occurred, the
Hearing Officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond without fees.
The Village Police Chief, or his or her designee, shall be authorized to contract with other units of local government to enter into cost sharing
agreements providing for the pooling of resources for purposes of conducting the administrative hearings described herein. (Ord. 2016-03-15B, 3-15-
2016)
E. Administrative Penalty: If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the
Village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. Unless stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under this section which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of the
deadline for seeking judicial review under the Administrative Review Law may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the penalty is paid to the Village and
any applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the towing firm, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally
entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the vehicle is
not retrieved within thirty five (35) days after an Administrative Hearing Officer issues a written decision, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles, as set forth in article II, chapter 4 of the Illinois Vehicle
Code.
F. Vehicle Possession:
1. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lienholder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle
impounded under this section until the administrative penalty and fees applicable under this section have been paid. However, whenever a person
with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person
if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the Village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all
lienholders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees.
2. For purposes of this section, the "owner of record" of a vehicle is the record titleholder as registered with the Secretary of State, State of Illinois.
G. General Regulations:
1. This section shall not replace or otherwise abrogate any existing State or Federal laws or Village ordinance pertaining to vehicle seizure and
impoundment, and these penalties shall be in addition to any penalties that may be assessed by a court for any criminal charges.
2. This section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities
within twenty four (24) hours after the theft was discovered.
3. Fees for towing and storage of a vehicle under this section shall be those approved by the chief of police for all towers authorized to tow for the
police department. (Ord. 2013-01-22A, 1-22-2013)

A. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's jurisdiction,
which will provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village rights of way and the
village as a whole.
B. Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of the public
ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
1. Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places;
2. Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
3. Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or public property;
4. Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of utility facilities;
5. Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
6. Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed;
7. Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
8. Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights of way; and
9. Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.
C. Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of way within the
jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated
by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
D. Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or
similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village rights of way. Utilities that
are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the village
may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this chapter.

similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
2. Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
F. Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent
of such conflict.
G. Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this chapter, the
utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
H. Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,

subcontractors shall comply with this section.
B. Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary
policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.

result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however,
that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord. 2008-
03-18C, 3-18-2008)
7-5-10: SECURITY:
A. Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously

security fund shall serve as security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee
is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to
perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to
the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least as
good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to
substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow
the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the
security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for
any single phase.
D. Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon
written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in subsection C of this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the
security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the
village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the
security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other

A. Authority Granted; No Property Right Of Other Interest Created: A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in
accordance with this chapter on village rights of way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights
of others who may have an interest in the rights of way and/or public property.
B. Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless installation has actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
C. Preinstallation Meeting Required: If deemed necessary by the village, a preinstallation meeting may be required. No construction or installation shall
begin pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform
any work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preinstallation meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village
with such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the
permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other
utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of way by the public during construction, and
access and egress by adjacent property owners.

within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify said deviations. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section 7-6-14 of this
chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the antenna and/or its appurtenances from the right of way
or modify the small cell antenna and/or small cell antenna facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. (Ord.

fees shall be set by time to time by resolution of the board of trustees of the village. (Ord. 2012-10-02A, 10-2-2012)
C. Delinquent Charges; Collection:
1. All user charges levied under the provisions of this chapter shall be liens upon the real estate upon or for which service is supplied, as provided by
law; however, such liens shall not attach to such real estate until such charges have become delinquent. For the purposes of this section, a charge
shall be determined delinquent fifteen (15) days after the billing has been mailed. The village shall send to the owner or owners of record of the real
estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number, a copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is delinquent in paying the
charges and a notice that the unpaid charges or rates may create a lien on the real estate. The village shall file notice of the lien in the office of the
recorder of the county in which such real estate is located. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out:
a. A description of the real estate sufficient for the identification thereof;
b. The amount of money due for such service; and
c. The date when such amount became delinquent.
2. In addition to any other method of collection as herein provided or as is provided by law, the village shall also have the power and authority to sue
the occupant or user of that real estate in a civil action to recover money due for water and/or sewer services, plus costs and a reasonable attorney
fee to be fixed by the court.

include the actual costs incurred by the village as assessed by the county recorder and an administrative fee in an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the county recording fee, and may, at the sole discretion of the user, include a release of lien fee in the amount as assessed by the county
recorder and an administrative fee in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the county recording fee; and if release of lien fee is paid, the village,
at no additional costs to the user, shall obtain, on user's behalf, the release of lien. (Ord. 2006-03-21A, 3-21-2006)
5. The village shall send statements to each user or customer on a monthly basis indicating the use data. Each billing shall become due fifteen (15)
days after mailing. A service charge of ten percent (10%) shall be added to the bill if not paid within fifteen (15) days after mailing. Bills of single
users with multiple water meters or flow meters shall be considered as one bill, and if any portion thereof is unpaid, the entire amount shall be
considered as delinquent.
6. In the event a bill is not paid within fifteen (15) days after mailing and has, therefore, become delinquent as provided herein, the village shall have
the power, in addition to the other powers herein granted, to refer the bill for collection to a collection agency, or other appropriate parties or
agencies, for collection. At the time of such referral, the village shall make an additional charge to the user in the amount of twenty five dollars
($25.00), which charge shall be added to the user's delinquent bill. It is hereby determined that such additional charge is reasonable and proper in
order to help the village defray its costs of collection.
7. If a customer disputes the amount of the water bill charged him, or a customer questions the accuracy of the meter for which data for computing the
bill was obtained, then the village will, at the written request of the customer, cause tests and examinations of the meter to be made to determine its
accuracy. If it is found as a result of such test that the meter registers a greater or less amount of water than is actually passed through it in excess of
the allowable variation of two percent (2%), the public works department shall have authority to adjust the error either positively or negatively so that
the water charge against the customer shall be that computed for the amount of water that actually passed through such meter. In no case, however,
where water service has been rendered for six (6) months or a portion thereof, shall the bill be adjusted below the minimum charges as set by this
chapter; and provided also, that no such adjustment shall be made if request for adjustment has not been made prior to the time such bill becomes
delinquent. No charges shall be made for water leaking from the service pipe that has not passed through the meter nor shall any deduction or
allowance be made with respect to the bill on account of leakage after water has passed through the meter.
D. Turn On After Disconnection: Any person who shall turn on or cause to be turned on the supply of water to any premises from which the supply of water
has been turned off by order of the village on account of nonpayment of water services, rents, charges or benefits, without receiving permission or
authority so to do, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each and every day for which the water is turned on after the water is turned off shall be construed
as a separate and distinct offense. (Ord. 628, 7-17-1995)
E. Administration And Processing Of Accounts: Village staff may promulgate administrative rules and regulations to address day to day issues, as they
may arise, regarding the collection, service termination, and delinquencies of water billing accounts, so long as these policies are not inconsistent with
any provision adopted herein. (Ord. 2015-12-01A, 12-1-2015)

Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to termination of water service and penalty as provided in section 1-4-1 of this
code for each violation. A new and separate violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each day that a violation exists. In the event that the village
must pursue any legal action, regardless of its nature, for the enforcement of this chapter or any other applicable ordinances, the owner, his agents and
employees, and occupant of any premises shall be liable for all costs, expenses and attorney fees of the village in taking such action. A determination by a
court that a violation of this chapter has taken place and the assessment of a penalty therefor shall not preclude the village from seeking a recovery of any

"BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES" FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
A.The general contractor, or if none, the property owner, shall be responsible for assuring that each contractor or subcontractor evaluates each site before
construction is initiated to determine if any site conditions may pose particular problems for the handling of any regulated substances. For instance,
handling regulated substances in the proximity of a Ground Water Protection Overlay Zone or water bodies may be improper.
B.If any regulated substances are stored on the construction site during the construction process, they shall be stored in a location and manner which will
minimize any possible risk of release to the environment. Any storage container of fifty five (55) gallons (208 l) or four hundred forty (440) pounds (200
kg), or more, containing regulated substances shall have constructed below it an impervious containment system constructed of materials of sufficient
thickness, density and composition that will prevent the discharge to the land, ground waters, or surface water, of any pollutant which may emanate
from said storage container or containers. Each containment system shall be able to contain one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the contents of all
storage containers above the containment system.
C.Each contractor shall familiarize himself/herself with the manufacturer's safety data sheet supplied with each material containing a regulated substance
and shall be familiar with procedures required to contain and clean up any releases of the regulated substance. Any tools or equipment necessary to
accomplish same shall be available in case of a release.
D.Upon completion of construction, all unused and waste regulated substances and containment systems shall be removed from the construction site by
the responsible contractor, and shall be disposed of in a proper manner as prescribed by law.

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 242/461
FLOOD PLAIN: That land typically adjacent to a body of water with ground surface elevations at or below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood
elevation. Flood plains may also include detached special flood hazard areas, ponding areas, etc. The flood plain is also known as the special flood hazard
area (SFHA). The flood plains are those lands within the jurisdiction of the Village that are subject to inundation by the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood. The SFHAs of the Village are generally identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Village prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and dated March 4, 1988. The SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Kane County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the Village are generally identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared for Kane
County by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated March 1, 1982.

conditions, wave actions and unpredictable effects such as those caused by ice or debris jams.
HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC CALCULATIONS: Engineering analysis which determines expected flood flows and flood elevations based on land
characteristics and rainfall events.
LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA): Official determination by FEMA that a specific structure is not in a 100-year flood zone; amends the effective
Flood Hazard Boundary Map or FIRM.
LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): Letter that revises base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries
or floodways as shown on an effective FHBM or FIRM.
MSL: Mean sea level.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term manufactured homes also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other

man. A natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its flood plain is not constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed
or cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross section of the stream
caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is
reestablished. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural conditions by man through regrading and revegetation.
ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK (OHWM): The point on the bank or shore up to which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to
leave a distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily
recognized characteristics.
PUBLIC FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT: A flood control project which will be operated and maintained by a public agency to reduce flood damages to
existing buildings and structures which includes a hydrologic and hydraulic study of the existing and proposed conditions of the watershed. Nothing in this
definition shall preclude the design, engineering, construction or financing, in whole or in part, of a flood control project by persons or parties who are not
public agencies.
PUBLICLY NAVIGABLE WATERS: All streams and lakes capable of being navigated by watercraft.
REGISTERED LAND SURVEYOR: A land surveyor registered in the State of Illinois, under the Illinois Land Surveyors Act.
REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER: An engineer registered in the State of Illinois under The Illinois Professional Engineering Act.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the flood plain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as
designated by DWR, which is needed to store and convey the existing and anticipated future 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than onetenth
of a foot (0.1') increase in stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%) increase in velocities. The
regulatory floodways are designated for Blackberry Creek, Welch Creek and Tributary Nos. 1 and 2 to Welch Creek on the Flood Boundary and Floodway
Map prepared by FEMA and dated March 4, 1988. The regulatory floodways for those parts of unincorporated Kane County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village that may be annexed into the Village are designated for Blackberry Creek, Welch Creek, Duffin Drain and Rob Roy
Creek on the Flood Boundary and Floodway map prepared by FEMA and dated March 1, 1982. To locate the regulatory floodway boundary on any site,
the regulatory floodway boundary should be scaled off the regulatory floodway map and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both
maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory floodway boundary, the Division should be contacted for the
interpretation.
REPAIR, REMODELING OR MAINTENANCE: Development activities which do not result in any increases in the outside dimensions of a building or any
changes to the dimensions of a structure.
RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY: A retention facility stores storm water runoff without a gravity release. A detention facility provides for storage of
storm water runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a flood or storm.

all actions as outlined in Section 10-1-13 of this Chapter.
B. General Administration And Enforcement: The Building Official shall be responsible for the general administration and enforcement of this Chapter
which shall include the following:
1. Determining Flood Plain Designation: Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area. If they are in a
special flood hazard area, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a flood plain on which a detailed study has not been conducted
which drains more than one square mile.
2. Professional Engineer Review: If the development site is within a floodway or in a flood plain on which a detailed study has not been conducted
which drains more than one square mile, then the permit shall be referred to a registered professional engineer under the employ or contract of the
Village for review to ensure that the development meets the requirements of Section 10-1-6 of this Chapter. In the case of an appropriate use, the
professional engineer shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of Section 10-1-6 of this Chapter.
3. Dam Safety Requirements: Ensure that a DWR dam safety permit has been issued or a letter indicating no dam safety permit is required, if the
proposed development activity includes construction of a "dam" as defined in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter. Regulated dams may include weirs,
restrictive culverts or impoundment structures.
4. Other Permit Requirements: Ensure that any and all required Federal, State and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a flood plain
development permit.
5. Plan Review And Permit Issuance: Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the Village meet the requirements of
this Chapter and issue a flood plain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and other regulations of this community
when the development meets the conditions of this Chapter.
6. Inspection Review: Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
they comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
7. Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain in the permit files an elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) of a residential or nonresidential building or the elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing
certificate for all buildings subject to Section 10-1-8 of this Chapter for public inspection and provide copies of same.

frequency flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this Chapter. Submit data to DWR and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency for proposed revisions of a regulatory map. Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program. Notify the Federal
Emergency Management Agency of any proposed amendments to this Chapter.
11. Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this Chapter subject, however,
to the review and approval of DWR and FEMA for any ordinance changes. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)
10-1-4: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This Chapter's protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance Study for the Village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is
not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey's
Flood Plain Information Repository. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed engineering study needed to
replace existing data with better data and submit it to DWR and FEMA.
A. Blackberry Creek And Welch Creek: The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of Blackberry Creek and Welch Creek shall be
as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of the Village prepared by FEMA and dated March 4, 1988, and such
amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
B. Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Of Village: The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Kane County
that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the Village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles
in the Flood Insurance Study of Kane County prepared by FEMA dated March 1, 1982, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as
may be prepared from time to time.
C. AH Or AO Zone: The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an AH Zone or AO Zone shall be that elevation (or
depth) delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Village.
D. A Zone: The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an A Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the Village shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey Flood Plain Information Repository. When no
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined
from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2 or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I TR-20 or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey
for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from
adopted local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to
DWR for approval, once approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing. For a nonriverine
SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved
by the Illinois State Water Survey. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)
10-1-5: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper
elevation and compensatory storage and other provisions of this Chapter are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this Section, along with the requirements of
Section 10-1-8 of this Chapter.

A. Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by State law shall commence any development in the SFHA
without first obtaining a development permit from the Building Official.
1. Application: Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Building Official. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer,
architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in MSL, 1929 adjusted datum or NGVD and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or
filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of Section 10-
1-8 of this Chapter.
2. Elevation Comparison: Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Building Official shall compare the elevation of the site to the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation
as of the sites first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this Chapter. The

B. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety.
1. Elevation Of Site: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit
sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the flood plain.
2. Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a flood plain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill
or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume
of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and fivetenths
(1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made
opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All flood plain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below
the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All flood plain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-

10-1-6-2: PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES; LIST OF APPROPRIATE USES:
A. Appropriate Uses: The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood
elevation and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety
and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic
habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this Chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in
92 Illinois Administrative Code 708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing
(including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The
approved appropriate uses are as follows:
1. Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion or water
quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
2. Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and
improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses.
3. Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls.
4. Underground and overhead utilities.
5. Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows and including open air pavilions.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 247/461
6. Detached garages, storage sheds or other nonhabitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block flood
flows, nor reduce floodway storage.
7. Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto.
8. Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot) and aircraft
parking aprons built at or below ground elevation.
9. Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse.
10. Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures or
construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than
ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure.
11. In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building.
12. Additions to existing buildings above the base flood elevation that do not increase the building's footprint and are valued at less than fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the building.
B. Protection Requirements: Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by DWR, the construction of an
appropriate use will be considered permissible; provided, that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so
stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer; and provided, that any structure meets the
protection requirements of Section 10-1-8 of this Chapter:
1. Preservation Of Flood Conveyance So As Not To Increase Flood Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, onstream
structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
a. Regulatory floodway conveyance,
"K" = 1.486 AR2/3
n
where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross section and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See
Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.)
b. The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a Federal,
State or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a
nonvegetative land cover.
c. Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
(1) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
(2) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
(3) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length
shall be used.
(4) Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
(5) All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.
2. Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream Flooding: Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and five-tenths (1.5) times the volume of flood plain storage lost. Artificially
created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway
storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost
below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above
the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's
engineer shall demonstrate to DWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is
hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification
is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
3. Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream Erosion Or Flood Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or
on-stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will
be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
4. Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway Approaches: The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one-tenth of a foot (0.1') when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the
channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 248/461
construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth of a foot (0.1'), the developer must contact DWR, Dam Safety Section for a
dam safety permit or waiver.
a. The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater
conditions for the flood study specified in Section 10-1-4 of this Chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for
the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways
calculation procedures.
b. Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection 10-1-6-2B2 of this Section.
c. Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection 10-1-6-2B3 of this Section.
d. If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a Department of Transportation permit must
be received.
e. The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
DWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this Section 10-1-6-2.
f. All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection B8 of this Section.
5. Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And Approach Roads:
a. The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth of a foot (0.1')
increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a
source of flood damage.
b. If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream flood plain, the
applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects
on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
c. The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules 92 Illinois Administrative Code 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and
submitted to the Division for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
6. On-Stream Structures Built For Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within
existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood
easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from DWR, Dam Safety Section, for a dam safety permit or waiver
for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All "dams" and impoundment structures as
defined in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Illinois Administrative Code 702 (Construction and
Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be
demonstrated that:
a. The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation or regional storm water detention.
b. The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such
as for spawning.
c. The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin.
d. A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in
which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control.
e. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this Section 10-1-6.
7. Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial Structures: If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the building.
Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities.
8. Excavation In Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement
of existing bridge and culvert structures or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the
excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
a. When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
b. When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length; and
c. When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length
shall be used.
d. Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections.
9. Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
a. There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of
water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the flood
plain, clearing the channel, high flow channel or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 249/461
b. Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be
destroyed or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values.
c. The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of
the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
(1) The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section,
slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated
into channel modification design, where practical.
(2) Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
(3) One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of
the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation.
(4) Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel.
(5) Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
(6) All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the
vegetative cover.
(7) If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established where
appropriate.
(8) A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
(9) New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion
of water into the new channel.
(10) There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by
a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
(11) Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the
floodway as a result of the modification.
d. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this Section 10-1-6.
10. Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
11. Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation in which there is potential for
erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
a. The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior
to the initiation of improvements.
b. Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not
be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
c. Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded
sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches
and sediment basins.
d. A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing channels.
Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion.
Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
e. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control" (IEPA, 1987).
12. Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this Section will be considered met if the applicant
can demonstrate to DWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in
increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
13. General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
a. The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in Section 10-1-4 of this Chapter, must be used for
analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, DWR shall be contacted for approval and
concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
b. If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream
with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this Section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 250/461
c. If the applicant learns from DWR, local governments or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed,
reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five (5) years,
the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this Section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built.
14. Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency
flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to DWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional
regulatory floodway map revision and receive from DWR a conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued.
However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by DWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA
and DWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the Municipality in incorporated areas and the County in unincorporated areas shall concur with
the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before DWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take
place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by
FEMA and DWR.
15. Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.
16. For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
a. A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
b. Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon
completion of construction.
c. The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream
maintenance purposes.
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as
necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate
use may be placed in that area until the Regulatory Floodway Map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The Regulatory
Floodway Map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DWR and FEMA of the as-built plans.
C. State Review: For those projects listed below located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DWR for their review and
concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
1. DWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection B4 of this Section.
2. DWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating
the proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection B5 of this Section.
3. The DWR will review alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections B1, B2 and B8 of this Section.
4. The DWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any Department projects, "dams" (as defined in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter)
and all other State, Federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the Municipality or County.
D. Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this Chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the
applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et
seq. No permit from DWR shall be required if the Division has delegated this responsibility to the Village.
E. Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a "dam" as defined in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter, per 92 Illinois

10-1-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHAs WITHIN UNIDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS:
In SFHAs or flood plains, where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by
FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly
increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
A. Development Permit:
1. Development Permit Required: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body, not exempted by State law, shall commence any development in
an SFHA or flood plain without first obtaining a development permit from the Building Official. Application for a development permit shall be made on
a form provided by the Building Official. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or
surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of Section 10-1-8 of this Chapter.
2. Application Data: The application for a development permit shall also include the following information:
a. Description Of Activity: A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and intended use;
b. Site Location: Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn to scale, on the Regulatory Floodway Maps, indicating whether it is
proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;

d. Plans: Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum:
(1) Vicinity Map: A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site,
graphic or numerical scale and north arrow;
(2) Plan View: A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of
the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum or NGVD, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and
flood control easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially
navigable body of water), flood plain limit, location and orientation of cross sections, north arrow and a graphical or numerical scale;
(3) Cross Section Views: Cross section views of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including
principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency flood
elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and
(4) Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control Plan: A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a
description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their
effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to
ensure postconstruction maintenance.
e. Engineering Calculations: Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of
subsection B of this Section.
f. Other Permits: Any and all other local, State and Federal permits or approvals that may be required for this type of development.
3. Elevation Comparison: Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois State Water Survey's Flood Plain Information Repository,
the Village Engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information
exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to subsection 10-1-4D of this Chapter. Any development located on
land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the
SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this Chapter. The Building Official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map
identification.

4. Other Permits: The Building Official shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, State and Federal permits,
approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The Building Official shall not issue the development permit
unless all required local, State and Federal permits have been obtained.
B. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been determined, shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods
as called for in this Chapter.
1. Standards Where Floodway Undetermined: Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall
apply:
a. The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations and data that the
project meets the engineering requirements of subsections 10-1-6-2B1 through B12 of this Chapter for the entire flood plain as calculated under
the provisions of subsection 10-1-4D of this Chapter. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a
floodway and submit that engineering study to DWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of their floodway by the
Department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of Section 10-1-6 of this Chapter for the regulatory
floodway. The "floodway" shall be defined according to the definition in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter.
b. A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from DWR or written documentation that a permit is not
required from DWR.
c. No permit from DWR shall be required if the Division has delegated permit responsibility to the Village per 92 Illinois Administrative Code, part 708
for regulatory floodways, per DWR statewide permit entitled "Construction in Flood Plains with No Designated Floodways in Northeastern Illinois".
d. Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a "dam" or an on-stream structure to impound water as
defined in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter shall obtain an Illinois Division of Water Resources dam safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not
required prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the Building Official finds a dam that does not have a DWR permit, the Building Official shall
immediately notify the Dam Safety Section of the Division of Water Resources. If the Building Official finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe
condition, the Building Official shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois Emergency Services, DWR, Dam Safety Section in
Springfield and Disaster Agency (ESDA).
e. The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory
floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this Chapter:

(B) Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or
(C) In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet (3') below the existing
streambed; and
(D) In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch
debris.
(2) Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
(A) Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; and
(B) Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
(C) Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the outfall location.
(3) Construction of shoreline and streambed protection that:
(A) Does not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in length or two (2) cubic yards per lineal foot of streambed.
(B) Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.
(C) Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel by more than ten percent (10%).
(D) Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
(4) Temporary stream crossings in which:
(A) The approach roads will be five-tenths foot (0.5') or less above natural grade.
(B) The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert.
(C) The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet (2') below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be
nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.

parallel to the flow of flood waters.
(10) Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:
(A) The affected length of stream is less than one thousand feet (1,000');
(B) The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream channels; or
(C) The cross-sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site.
f. The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.
2. Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a flood plain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill
or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume
of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and fivetenths
(1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made
opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All flood plain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below
the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All flood plain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-
year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)
10-1-8: REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOOD PLAIN AREAS:
In addition to the requirements found in Sections 10-1-5, 10-1-6 and 10-1-7 of this Chapter for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways, and
SFHAs or flood plains where no floodways have been identified (Zones A, AO, AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E), the following
requirements shall be met:
A. Public Health Standards:
1. No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood plain elevation.
2. New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted, providing all
manholes or other aboveground openings located below the flood plain elevation are watertight.
B. Carrying Capacity And Notification: For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying
capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the Village shall notify adjacent communities in writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance
of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
C. Protecting Buildings:
1. Building Protection Criteria: All buildings located within a 100-year flood plain also known as an SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below
the flood protection elevation. However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use
standards included in Section 10-1-6 of this Chapter. This building protection criteria applies to the following situations:
a. Construction or placement of a new building.
b. A structural alteration to an existing building that either increases the first floor area by more than twenty percent (20%) or the building's market
value by more than fifty percent (50%);
c. Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This building protection requirement does not
apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and
d. Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods.
2. Permanent Landfill Specifications: A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed, may be constructed on permanent landfill in accordance
with the following:
a. The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation.
b. The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot (1') deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet (10') beyond the
foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation.
However, the ten foot (10') minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages
due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties.
3. Elevations: A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance with the following:

e. Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days shall be elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation and shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the Rules
and Regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act issued pursuant to 77 Illinois Administrative Code 870.
4. Dry Floodproofed: Only a nonresidential building may be structurally dry floodproofed (in lieu of elevation); provided that, a registered professional
engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation, the structure and attendant utility
facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing
measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity. (Levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are
not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection.)
5. Nonconforming Structures: Nonconforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or
structurally altered. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or manmade disaster may be restored unless the
damage exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this Chapter. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)

subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation data and floodway delineations. Where this information is not available from
an existing study filed with the Illinois State Water Survey, the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation per subsection 10-1-4D of this Chapter and the floodway delineation per the definition in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter and
submitting it to the State Water Survey and DWR for review and approval as best available regulatory data.
C. Preservation Of Natural Streams And Channels: Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as
to preserve and utilize natural streams and channels. Wherever possible, the flood plains shall be included within parks or other public grounds.
D. Approval Of Developments Outside Corporate Limits: The Board of Trustees shall not approve any planned unit development or plat of subdivision
located outside the corporate limits unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)
10-1-10: VARIANCES:
No variances shall be granted to any development located in a "regulatory floodway" as defined in Section 10-1-2 of this Chapter. However, when a
development proposal is located outside of a regulatory floodway, and whenever the standards of this Chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Building Official for a variance. The Building Official shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Board of Trustees.
A. Variance Requirements: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that:
1. The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA;
2. An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not granted;
3. The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
4. There will be no additional threat to public health, safety, beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat or creation of a nuisance;

7. The activity is not in a regulatory floodway;
8. The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a general problem; and
9. The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the area involved including existing stream uses.
B. Notice Of Lessened Degree Of Protection: The Building Official shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of Section 10-1-
8 of this Chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
1. Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage;
2. Increase the risks to life and property; and
3. Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability.
C. National Register Of Historical Places: Variances requested in connection with restoration of a site or building listed on the National Register of
Historical Places or documented as worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency may be granted using criteria more permissive
than the requirements of subsections A and B of this Section. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)
10-1-11: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived
from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Chapter
does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This Chapter does not create liability on the
part of the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)
10-1-12: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this Chapter and other
ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This Chapter is
intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, but is not intended to
repeal the resolution which the Village passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)
10-1-13: PENALTY:
A. Notice Of Failure To Comply: Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation
of this Chapter. Upon due investigation, the Building Official may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this Chapter exists. The
Building Official shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
B. Failure To Correct Violation: If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the violation:
1. The Village may make application to the Circuit Court for an injunction requiring conformance with this Chapter or make such other order as the
Court deems necessary to secure compliance with the Chapter.

($1,000.00) for each offense.
3. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
4. The Village may record a notice of violation on the title to the property.
C. Suspension Of Standard Flood Insurance: The Building Official shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood
damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
D. Other Remedies: Nothing herein shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 621, 5-15-1995)

11-1-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The village of Sugar Grove zoning ordinance (ordinance) is adopted with the purpose of protecting and promoting the public health, safety, comfort and
general welfare of the people. This is to be accomplished by seeking to:
A. Establish districts with the mix of permitted uses necessary to achieve the goals and objectives of Sugar Grove's adopted comprehensive land use plan
which promote a growing tax and employment base, while maintaining a balance between residential and nonresidential land uses.
B. Foster a rational pattern and relationship of land uses between residential, business, commercial, and industrial, for the mutual benefit of all, and
prevent uses, buildings or structures that are incompatible with those of the surrounding area.
C. Provide for the regulation of, and elimination of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses that are incompatible with surrounding uses, and which
may adversely affect the character and value of desired new development in each district.
D. Avoid undue concentrations of population or activity and prevent the overcrowding of land, thereby ensuring proper living and working conditions while
preventing blight and slums, providing adequate standards for the provision of light, air, and open spaces.
E. Avoid hazards to persons and damage to property that can result from the inappropriate development of lands, and provide for adequate drainage,
erosion control, and reduction of flood damage.
F. Provide and preserve open space according to the village's comprehensive land use plan to: meet the recreational needs of the residents of Sugar
Grove; provide buffering between incompatible uses; and protect the natural environment.
G. Promote the establishment of a diversity of dwelling unit types, consistent with land classifications illustrated on the Sugar Grove land use map, to meet
the needs of existing and future residents.
H. Allow development to occur according to densities and bulk regulations set forth in this title only in those instances when such uses foster rational
development patterns and streets, water, sewerage, schools, and parks are provided, consistent with village requirements.
I. Provide convenient and safe access to individual properties, while maintaining the safety and operational efficiency of adjacent village streets.
J. Lessen congestion on the public streets that could result from expanding the residential and nonresidential land uses according to the intensities
allowed by this title by requiring developers to: make appropriate improvements to existing streets; construct new streets according to standards set
forth in the subdivision regulations; and assist in the construction of the collector roadways illustrated on Sugar Grove's comprehensive land use plan.
K. Provide for adequate off street parking and loading facilities for all residential and nonresidential properties, so as not to obstruct the travelway of
parking lots, drive aisles or adjacent streets.
L. Promote the creation of unified planned developments, in which there is compatibility in architectural design, landscaping, signage and lighting.
M. Promote the visual softening of streets, parking lots, and other impervious surfaces by landscaping residential and nonresidential developments.
N. Require the preservation of sites, areas and structures of historical, architectural, cultural and aesthetic importance that are unique to Sugar Grove and
the surrounding area.
O. Define the powers and duties of the administrative and enforcement officers and bodies. (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)
11-1-3: METHOD IN WHICH PURPOSES ARE TO BE FILLED:
In order to fulfill the statement of purpose and intent as expressed in section 11-1-2 of this chapter, conditions, regulations and requirements are
hereinafter set forth in this title. They are intended to:
A. Divide the entire municipality into districts of such number, shape, area and of such different classifications (according to use of land and buildings,
height and bulk of buildings, intensity of the use of the lot, area, area of open spaces, or other classification) as may be deemed best suited to carry out
the purposes of this title.
B. Classify and regulate the location of agricultural, residential, municipal, commercial, commercial recreational, industrial, other uses within each
individual district.

way, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the district boundary.
2. Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the Village Board, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street,

NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES
11-5-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A. The village finds that buildings, structures and uses of land, which do not conform to the underlying regulations of the zoning district in which they are
located, substantially and adversely affect the orderly development and taxable value of other property in that district.
B. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of such nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses of land, and to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which such nonconforming buildings, structures and uses may be continued or redeveloped.
C. Any nonconforming building, structure or use of land that exists lawfully at the time this title is adopted may be continued according to the regulations
that follow.
D. The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is a legal nonconformity shall, in all cases, be the responsibility of the owner or user of the
nonconforming building, structure or use. (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)

located as to lot area, lot width and lot depth, may be used for the erection of a building intended for a use permitted in the district in which the lot is
located provided, however, that such building complies with all setback requirements delineated on the recorded plat of subdivision (or if not so
recorded, if the lot in question was created of record on or before January 15, 2002, said lot may utilize the setback requirements of the zoning
ordinance in effect immediately prior to said date) for that lot and all other applicable requirements of this title. (Ord. 2007-08-21A, 8-21-2007)
B. Nonconforming Buildings Or Structures: A lawfully existing, nonconforming building or structure which does not contain any nonconforming use, but
does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements or building bulk regulations in the district in which it is located, may be continued except as
otherwise permitted by this chapter and shall be subject to the following regulations:
1. Enlargement, Repair Or Alteration:
a. Any nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, remodeled or structurally altered, provided, however, that no such

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 308/461
existing nonconformity of all or any part of such building or structure. Damaged or destroyed buildings or structures shall be subject to the
restrictions contained in subsection B2 of this section.
b. A building that contains a nonconforming residential use may be altered to increase the livability of the building, provided no structural alteration
occurs that would increase the number of dwelling units.
c. Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a building or other structure (other than a
damaged or destroyed building or other structure subject to the provisions of subsection B2 of this section) in accordance with the order of a public
official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such building or other structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to
a safe condition.
2. Damage Or Destruction:
a. In the event that a nonconforming building or structure or use of land is damaged or destroyed to the extent that the cost of restoration exceeds
fifty percent (50%) or more of the replacement value of such building, structure or use, no repairs or reconstruction will be allowed to take place
unless such restoration or reconstruction brings the building, structure or use into conformance with all applicable regulations of the district in
which it is located.
b. If such damage or destruction does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the building, structure or use, repairs shall be completed
within eighteen (18) months of the date of the damage or destruction, unless extended by the village board. Building restoration shall be made to
conform to all the provisions of the district in which the building, structure or use is located.
3. Relocation Of Buildings Or Structures: No nonconforming building, structure or use shall be moved in whole, or in part, to any other location on the
same or any other zoning lot, unless every portion of such building or structure, and the use thereof, conforms to all of the regulations of the district in
which it is to be located. (Ord. 2015-07-21, 7-21-2015)

building or structure, such existing use may be continued according to regulations which follow:
A. Change:
1. A nonconforming use of a building or other structure, all or substantially all of which was designed or intended for a use which is not permitted in the
district of which it is located, shall not be changed to any use other than one permitted in the district in which the land is located. When a
nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use.
2. The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is incidental or
accessory to the principal use of land, shall not be changed to any other use, except to a use permitted in the district in which the land is located.
3. A nonconforming use in effect at the time an amendatory ordinance becomes effective shall be discontinued and not reestablished, except when the
provisions of the amendatory ordinance find the use to be conforming to the district in which it is located.
B. Discontinuance: In the event that operation of a nonconforming use of land, building or structure is discontinued for twelve (12) months, such
nonconforming use shall not be reestablished, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land shall conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located. The owner's intent to resume active operation shall not affect the foregoing restriction.
C. Nonconforming Accessory Uses: No nonconforming accessory use shall continue after the principal use, to which it is subordinate, has been abolished.
(Ord. 2011-07-05B, 7-5-2011)

planned unit development (PUD) in the district in which it is located, such use shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without any further
action, be deemed a lawful special use or PUD in such district. However, no such lawful special use or PUD shall be substantially expanded or altered
unless a supplemental special use permit or planned unit development ordinance is secured according to chapter 13 (for special uses) or chapter 11

Chapter 11
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
11-11-1: PURPOSE:
A. The purpose of the planned unit development provisions which follow is to promote efficient land patterns which provide site amenities; secure large
parcels of permanent open space, characteristic of Sugar Grove's existing semirural environment; and preserve trees, wetlands and other natural
resources.
B. These provisions are intended to encourage and accommodate more creative and imaginative design for land development than would otherwise be
possible under the strict application of Sugar Grove's conventional zoning and subdivision ordinance provisions.
C. Implementation of this chapter will result in efficient land patterns and, therefore, more economical land development, that:
1. Fosters high quality development by allowing flexibility in land use and design standards, thereby encouraging innovative site planning;
2. Promotes more efficient land patterns, which not only preserve open space and natural resources, but also provide for more economical networks of
utilities, streets and other facilities;
3. Promotes diverse, high quality, residential environments, which include a mixture of dwelling unit types;
4. Promotes a land use pattern with a mixture of residential and nonresidential uses that will mutually support each other;
5. Provides for the permanent preservation of open space for the continued use and enjoyment of residents of each subdivision and the Village;
6. Provides usable and suitably located public and private recreational facilities;
7. Encourages developers to provide amenities that enhance the quality of life, both within the planned unit development, as well as within the
community as a whole;
8. Encourages a land use pattern which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare;
9. Allows more than one building per zoning lot, when determined to be of benefit to the residents of a proposed subdivision; and (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-
15-2002)
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 335/461
10. Allows the creation of a mixed use residential, commercial, or industrial planned unit development, pursuant to criteria set forth in this chapter. (Ord.
2014-08-05B, 8-5-2014)
11-11-2: SPECIAL USE:
A. Planned unit developments are of such substantially different character from conventional subdivisions or development on individual zoning lots and,
therefore, require administrative processing as special uses, under the provisions of section 11-13-12 of this title. (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)
B. Because planned unit developments are complex and of a different character than other special uses, the Village has established more specific
procedures and standards, and criteria for exceptions from regulations of the underlying zoning district than those included in chapter 13 of this title.
Procedures, standards and criteria for exceptions which follow are intended to guide the recommendations of the Planning Commission/Zoning Board
of Appeals and Village Board during their review of preliminary and final plans. (Ord. 2018-03-20B, 3-20-2018)
11-11-3: PERMITTED USES:
Planned unit developments may include uses and structures not otherwise permitted in the underlying zoning district, provided landscape screening is
provided between dissimilar land uses, and the petitioner shows the planned unit development: accomplishes the standards set forth in this chapter;
achieves the planning goals and objectives of the Village, as defined in this chapter and the Comprehensive Land Use Plan; and is compatible with
adjacent land uses.
A. Residential Planned Unit Developments:
1. A residential planned unit development may be processed for only one type of dwelling unit, but is intended to also allow a mixture of dwelling unit
types, thereby offering a choice in lifestyle to residents of the development. Nonresidential land uses of a religious, institutional, cultural, recreational,
or commercial character may be permitted in a residential planned unit development, to the extent that they can be integrated with the residential
land use. Where provided, nonresidential uses in a residential planned unit development shall: (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)
a. Reserved.
b. Be compatible in appearance and scale with the residential structures. They shall not be established prior to the construction of residential units,
unless specifically authorized by the Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals and the Village Board. (Ord. 2018-03-20B, 3-20-2018)
2. Residential developments in the E-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, and SR Districts shall be processed as planned unit developments when any of the following

11-11-4: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. General:
1. Traditional development controls, as set forth in the zoning and subdivision ordinances, may restrict imaginative development. Therefore, it is the
intent of these provisions to permit review of integrated site proposals on their own merits, where they afford the Village amenities and benefits that
enhance the quality of life due to unified planning and design.
2. These provisions are not intended, and shall not be used, as a means to circumvent the procedures or standards of the zoning and subdivision
control ordinances, and thereby allow a lower standard of development than otherwise permitted under the strict interpretation of these codes.
Rather, they are intended to take advantage of particular site characteristics, to increase the flexibility and originality of design in large scale projects,
to provide more open space and recreational opportunities than would otherwise be required, to promote the protection of high quality natural
resources, and to establish better transitions between dissimilar land uses.
3. The unique characteristics of the area, and the uniqueness of the approach to development, will determine the degree of flexibility afforded from
regulations of the underlying zoning district. (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)
B. Standards: Unless otherwise approved by the Village Board, pursuant to recommendations of the Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals, the
following standards shall apply. Approval of exceptions from these standards is intended to be granted only when it is determined appropriate or
necessary to achieve one of the objectives of section 11-11-1 of this chapter: (Ord. 2018-03-20B, 3-20-2018)
1. Ownership: The proposed planned unit development shall be under the unified control of the petitioner.
2. Comprehensive Plan: The proposed planned unit development shall conform to the land uses, intent, and spirit of the comprehensive plan and other
planning objectives established for the Village.
3. Compatibility: Uses permitted in a planned unit development shall be compatible with surrounding land uses. (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)
4. Subdivided: Unless otherwise approved by the Village Board, only one principal building shall be constructed per parcel. Preliminary and final plats
of subdivision shall be required in accordance with procedures set forth in the Subdivision Code, as may be amended from time to time.
5. Yards: The required yards along the periphery of a planned unit development shall be at least equal in depth to those of the underlying zoning
district, or the adjacent zoning district, whichever is greater. The Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend greater setbacks
from the boundary line of a planned unit development when determined necessary to protect the privacy of residents in both existing and proposed
subdivisions.

amended from time to time.
b. The Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the Village Board approve, reduced rights-of-way or pavement width in
residential subdivisions, but only in those instances where documentation is submitted that shows proposed widths will accommodate anticipated
traffic associated with the planned unit development, as well as traffic that is expected to be generated by existing and planned development in the
vicinity of the proposed project.
9. Vehicular Access: Points of vehicular ingress and egress to the site shall be minimized to maintain the safety and operational efficiency of arterial
streets and collector roadways. Where possible, cross access between properties shall be provided.
10. Screening: Where a nonresidential use abuts a residential use, landscape screening shall be provided. Screening shall be a minimum of six feet
(6') in height, and shall include evergreen trees, not less than six feet (6') tall. Screening may also include walls, fences, berms, deciduous and
ornamental trees, shrubs, or any combination thereof, in addition to the required evergreen trees. (Ord. 2018-03-20B, 3-20-2018)

b. Where it is determined that trees six inches (6") dbh or greater must be removed to allow for proposed development, tree replacement will be
required:
(1) Not less than one (1) 3-inch caliper tree shall be required for each six inches (6") of tree proposed to be removed, as measured at breast
height. However, in no instance shall more than three (3) 3-inch caliper replacement trees be required for any tree removed.
(2) Replacement trees shall be required in addition to any other landscaping that may be required by this title, except landscape screening. In this
instance replacement trees can be used for screening a planned unit development and properties planned, zoned or used for residential
purposes.
(3) The number of trees that an individual property can support, according to good forestry practices, shall determine the number of replacement
trees that will be required on an individual lot. (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)
13. Performance Standards: All activities associated with a commercial, industrial, or mixed use planned unit development shall conform to standards

a. The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would bring particular hardship upon the
owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulation were to be carried out.

buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as related to the land, are essentially uniform.
2. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique character, cannot be properly classified in any particular district

particular use or particular location.

a. Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities, which are uses traditionally associated with a public interest, such as parks,
recreation areas, public administrative buildings, or the private use of existing public buildings.

(2) In the case of a request for a special use by a unit of local government, for a public use within its statutory mandate, the review shall not be
based on determining the need for the publicly mandated use on the specific site but, rather for assessing the impact of the proposed public use
upon neighboring lands, and upon the Village's streets or utilities.

upon neighboring property, public facilities, the Village as a whole, or the natural environment or resources. (Ord. 2002-01-15B, 1-15-2002)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 374/461
This chapter establishes the regulations for the installation, design, erection, construction, engineering, alteration, maintenance, repair, removal, relocation,
and use of signs which are meant to be observed from the exterior, together with their appurtenant and auxiliary devices and supporting structures, within
the village for the following purposes:
A. To enhance the economy of the village by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signage and advertising. Attractive, readable signs
can improve the appearance of the village by avoiding the "canceling out" effect of conflicting adjacent signs.
B. To enhance the physical appearance of the village. Signage which complements the architecture, is in keeping with the scale of a building and the
zoning district, and makes for an easily understandable streetscape, results in a more appealing community.
C. To provide uniform regulations and orderly development of signage throughout the village.
D. To increase traffic safety by reducing distractions. With a reasonable level of signage confronting a motorist, one is better able to notice, consider and
react to traffic control devices in a timely and safe manner.
E. To promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience, and general welfare of the residents of the village.
F. To promote signage appropriate to the zoning district and to assure compatibility of signage with surrounding land uses.
G. To recognize the critical nature of and encourage solutions for the special or unique signage needs and circumstances found within certain locations of
the village.
H. The community development director or his/her designee shall be responsible for determining compliance with this chapter and approving any permit.

properties separated by highways, streets, public ways or railroads or other public utility rights- of-way shall be deemed contiguous for the purpose of
qualifying as a planned development district. All procedures required by this chapter for the establishment of a planned development district shall be
applicable to the addition of property to an existing planned development district, and any provision of this chapter or of any other ordinance of the Village
of Sugar Grove which refers to the establishment of a planned development district shall, with respect to such added property, be deemed to refer to the

12-7-3-3: CRITERIA FOR THE ACCEPTANCE OF DEDICATED LANDS:
A. Much of the neighborhood park land acquired by the village is received pursuant to this chapter. The amount of park land required in a new
development is calculated based on the requirement of ten (10.0) acres of park land per one thousand (1,000) population.
If land is not needed or practical in a development, the developer is required to donate cash in lieu of land in an amount determined per the criteria set
forth in this chapter.
The village requires that the land dedicated be nonflood, high, dry land. The land should be free from any storm water detention or retention basins or
lakes. However, the village will also accept storm water basins and lakes when they meet the criteria set forth in this chapter and prove to have a public
recreational benefit that offsets the perpetual maintenance responsibilities that would be assumed by the village. The village feels that the acceptance
of these retention and detention areas is an equal tradeoff to the perpetual maintenance responsibility and therefore no credit toward land/cash
obligations will be given if these areas are accepted for maintenance responsibility by the village.
It is the village's policy to not accept stand alone detention or retention facilities. The village will consider the acceptance of these facilities when
designed with a functional required park.
B. The following criteria shall be applied to property dedicated to the village pursuant to this chapter:
1. All land must be free from detention or retention requirements and be above the 100-year flood level.

within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution, in lieu thereof, shall be required for any additional
land that would have been required to be dedicated.
B. When a major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the
development to complete the site, the remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for
any additional land that would have otherwise been required to be dedicated. (Ord. 660, 4-15-1997)
12-7-7: DENSITY FORMULA AND TABLES:
The following table shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof. A subdivider or developer
may file a written objection to the table of estimated ultimate population listed herein. If so, he/she shall submit his/her own demographic study showing the
estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development. In that event, final determination of the density formula
to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board, at its sole discretion, based upon such demographic information submitted by the
subdivider or developer, this title and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park district, school district or others. The

FLOODPLAINS AND WETLANDS
12-8-1: PURPOSE:
The village has a duty to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the present and future residents of the village and downstream drainage areas
by providing for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance and use of the village watercourses, lakes, ponds, floodplains and wetland areas. It is the
intent of this chapter to:
A. Prevent flood damage by preserving storm and floodwater storage capacity;
B. Maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams, ponds, wetlands and ground water by storing and providing for infiltration of storm water runoff in
floodplains and wetlands, and releasing it slowly to maintain steady in stream flow;
C. To improve water quality, both by filtering and storing sediments and attached pollutants, nutrients and organic compounds before they drain into
streams and wetlands and by maintaining the natural pollutant assimilating capabilities of streams, floodplains and wetlands;
D. To protect wildlife habitat;
E. To preserve areas of special recreational, scenic or scientific interest, including natural areas and habitats of endangered species;
F. To maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of developing areas;
G. To encourage the continued economic growth and high quality of life in the village which depends in part on an adequate quality of water, a pleasing
natural environment and recreational opportunities in proximity to the village. (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994)
12-8-2: PROHIBITION OF DEVELOPMENT:
Any property, parcels, tracts, lots or lands contained within a floodplain or wetland shall not be developed except as otherwise provided herein. Floodplain
shall include floodway and flood fringe. (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994)
12-8-3: VARIANCE:
A. Application: An owner of any such property may apply for a variance to said prohibition which process shall be in accordance with the most recently
adopted floodplain ordinances of the village1 as promulgated by the federal emergency management agency.
B. Protection Of Natural Resources: No variance shall be granted unless the village finds that the development will not detrimentally affect or destroy
natural features such as ponds, streams, wetlands and forested areas, or impair their natural functions, but will preserve and incorporate such features
into the development's site.
C. Floodplain; Wetlands Restricted: No variance shall be granted for construction of any structures in a floodplain or wetland which are designed or
intended to be occupied by people. Any such variance request shall be limited to the allowance of construction of parking areas, water retention areas,
walkways, bike paths, parks and other open space type uses. (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994)
12-8-4: DRAINAGE INTO WETLANDS:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 429/461
Wetlands shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In
addition to the other requirements of this title, the following requirements shall be met for a development or subdivisions whose drainage flows into
wetlands:
A. Modification Of Existing Wetlands: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of storm water detention unless it is demonstrated that the
wetland is low in quality and the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing
depressional storage in wetlands shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this title shall be in
addition to the existing storage.
B. Protection During Construction: The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures
and shall not be filled.
C. Site Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland.
D. Runoff: All runoff from the development shall be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two (2) year,
twenty four (24) hour rainfall event and hold it for at least twenty four (24) hours before being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed
before property grading begins.
E. Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width, preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around
the periphery of the wetland, stream, lake or pond. The buffer strip shall extend landward from the ordinary high water mark of surface water or from
the edge of a wetland.
F. Development Within Minimum Setback: Absolutely no development activity (except as provided herein) may occur within the "minimum setback", which
is defined as seventy five feet (75') from the ordinary high water mark of streams, lakes and ponds, the edge of wetlands or within a designated
depressional area. The following development activities may be permitted:
1. Minor Improvements: Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations, foot bridges and docks;
2. Maintenance: The maintenance or replacement of existing highways and bridges, utility poles and towers;
3. Parks And Recreation Areas: The establishment and development of public and private parks and recreation areas. (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994)
12-8-5: COMPENSATORY STORAGE:
Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the 100-
year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the 100-year
frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half (11/2) times the volume of storage lost due to fill or the
structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain
storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the
existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse. (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994)
12-8-6: KANE COUNTY STORM WATER ORDINANCE ADOPTED:
The village hereby adopts the Kane County storm water ordinance by reference. (Ord. 2002-01-15A, 1-15-2002)

Any applicant for preliminary plan approval or final plan approval may submit a request in writing to the Village Clerk for variations or exceptions from
these regulations. Variations may be granted by the Village Board, upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals,
provided the variation does not pertain to requirements of titles 11 and 12 of this Code. In granting any variation, the Planning Commission/Zoning Board
of Appeals may recommend and the Village Board may prescribe such conditions deemed necessary or desirable for the public interest. (Ord. 604, 9-8-
1994; amd. Ord. 2018-03-20B, 3-20-2018)
12-9-2: STANDARDS:

following conditions are met: (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994; amd. Ord. 2018-03-20B, 3-20-2018)
A. Physical Peculiarities: Because of the shape, topography or other physical conditions of the proposed subdivision or its surroundings: 1) a hardship or
practical difficulty would be caused by strict compliance with these requirements, and/or 2) the purposes of these requirements would be served to a
greater extent by an alternative design.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 430/461
B. Unique Conditions: That the conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are unique to the subject property and have not been created by
the applicant or any other person having an interest in the subject property.
C. Harmless: That granting the variation will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare and will not be injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located.
D. Minimum Necessary: The variation granted is the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994)
12-9-3: FACTORS CONSIDERED:
In making its findings as required above, the Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land
in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside and/or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic
conditions in the vicinity. (Ord. 604, 9-8-1994; amd. Ord. 2018-03-20B, 3-20-2018)

placement of the surface course, all underground utility punch list items for final inspection shall be completed and approved. Also, the binder course
patches must be completed and the curb and gutter repaired as required by the Village Engineer.
After any binder course deficiencies have been corrected to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer and immediately prior to placing the asphalt surface
course, the pavement shall be thoroughly cleaned and primed with bituminous materials at a residual asphalt rate of 0.05 pounds per square foot. When
bituminous materials are applied under traffic conditions, sanding at the approximate rate of two (2) pounds to four (4) pounds per square yard will be
required. All affected residents and businesses shall be notified a minimum of twenty four (24) hours prior to placement of bituminous materials.
The bituminous base course, leveling binder, binder course, and surface course mixtures shall be laid on a surface, which is dry and only when weather
conditions meet all standards stated in the IDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.
All paving shall be done with an IDOT approved paving machine utilizing electronic grade control of a minimum length of fifteen feet (15'), but the length of
the machine shall be suitable for the width of the road and be verified as acceptable by the Village Engineer.
All asphalt mixtures shall be delivered and handled so that the asphalt mixture immediately behind the paver screed is at or above two hundred seventy
degrees Fahrenheit (270°F). All asphalt delivered to the project shall be covered.
Paving timeframe and condition requirements shall be consistent with IDOT Standard Specifications. However, the Village Engineer may approve a written
request to allow the installation of binder course after this date provided the above requirements are met. The request must be made in writing to the
Village Engineer forty eight (48) hours prior to the requested paving dates, along with a weather forecast for the next ninety six (96) hours. Surface course
must be placed the paving season following binder course installation, after a winter has passed. The asphalt laying pattern must be approved by the
Village Engineer or his/her representative in order to minimize longitudinal joints. A certified nuclear density technician must be on site to set the asphalt
pavement rolling pattern and confirm compaction densities. The technician shall revise the rolling pattern as deemed necessary. The technician shall stop
the paving operation if the required densities are not being met. Density test results shall be submitted to the Village Engineer within one week of
completion of the paving operation.
The binder course and surface course may be tested for smoothness with a sixteen foot (16') straightedge after it has been thoroughly compacted. Any
surface variations which warrant penalties per section 406.11 of the Illinois Department of Transportation Standard Specifications will be paid to the Village
of Sugar Grove per the rates per each surface variation and/or repairs identified in the Illinois Department of Transportation Standard Specifications. This
will be done at the sole expense of the contractor. For any surface variations 0.75 inch or greater, the contractor shall remove and replace a large number
of bumps; however, complete removal and replacement of the surface course at the contractor's expense will be required.
All streets and roadways shall conform to the minimum design standards shown in section 12-11-3-2, table 12-11-3-2, "Minimum Standards For Street
Design", of this section 12-11-3. Existing roadways running through or adjacent to a development shall be reconstructed by the developer to comply with
these Standard Specifications for Improvements unless the Village Engineer recommends and the Village Board concurs that "substantial improvement",
in lieu of reconstruction, will meet the intent of these specifications. If these roadways to be improved exist within prescriptive right-of-way, off center
improvements may be required with greater width dedications on the side of the proposed development. Recapture agreements will most likely be
appropriate as determined by the Board of Trustees. (Ord. 2018-02-20, 2-20-2018)

All street pavements shall be designed in accordance with the following minimum standards:
A. Procedure: The thickness of the pavements for major collectors and arterials shall be determined in accordance with the current Illinois Department of
Transportation "Manual for Structural Design of Portland Cement Concrete Pavement" and the "Manual of Instructions for the Structural Design of
Bituminous Concrete Pavements". Design Standards shall be not less than for Class III roads and based on a 20 year pavement design. The above
thickness determination procedures shall be followed unless required otherwise by a jurisdictional authority.
B. Minimum Design Criteria: The following are the minimum pavement requirements that will be required in the design and construction of all roadway
pavements in the Village of Sugar Grove.
1. Pavement Standards:
a. Pavements shall be constructed of hot mix asphalt mixtures. The hot mix asphalt mixtures shall be designed, produced and constructed in
accordance with IDOT Standard Specifications and IDOT District 1 special provisions. Portland cement concrete pavement designs are not
prohibited and will be considered for some roadway designs if the developer so desires.
b. All roadways shall have concrete curb and gutter, type M-3.12 where driveway access is allowed in residential neighborhoods, and type B-6.12 in
all other applications, unless recommended otherwise by the Village Engineer. The required cross section of these curb types is as shown in the
Standard Details. Two (2) no. 4 steel reinforcing bars, twenty feet (20') in length, shall be installed centered on all trench crossings. Expansion
joints, in accordance with the Standard Detail, shall be spaced per the Typical Expansion Joint Spacing Curb and Gutter Chart in the Standard
Drawing, all points of curvature, five feet (5') each side of drainage structures and between separate pours. Minimum two inches (2") deep
contraction joints shall be saw cut at minimum ten feet (10') intervals within twenty four (24) hours of curb placement. Contraction joints shall be
sealed with a sealant to be approved by the Village. An approved spray-on curing compound with white fugitive dye shall be applied immediately
after finishing of the curb. A concrete sealer, WR Meadows TIAH, or approved equal, shall be applied between seven (7) days and ten (10) days
following curb installation. The curb shall be installed on a minimum of four inches (4") of the same aggregate base course used for the roadway
construction. The compacted curb sub-grade shall be shaped parallel to the curb flow line and positively drained to the inlets and catch basins so
that any water, if applied, would not pocket in this subgrade.
c. All rough grading of the roadway(s) shall be completed prior to construction of any underground utility with the exception of storm sewers and
sanitary sewers.
d. In accordance with 605 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/9-115.1 regarding the location of earthen berms in relation to the right-of-way, no part of a
berm shall be located within ten feet (10') of the right-of-way line.
e. Pavement cross slope shall be two percent (2%) from the center of the road to the edge of the pavement.
f. Following installation of the asphalt surface course, hot poured joint sealer shall be applied to the joint between the finished pavement surface and
the curb and gutter in accordance with section 451 of the IDOT Standard Specifications.
g. All roadways shall be constructed on a select compacted sub-grade, graded parallel to the finish surface.
h. Any street cut which is permitted by the Village shall be restored to like or better conditions and shall be acceptable to the Village Engineer.
2. Roadway Design Criteria:
a. The definitions of all proposed roadway classifications shall be consistent with table 12-11-3-2, "Minimum Standards For Street Design", of this
section.
b. Table 12-11-3-2, "Minimum Standards For Street Design", of this section, sets forth the minimum design thickness for each roadway material for
various road designations. For all categories in table 12-11-3-2 of this section, under Village jurisdiction, the hot-mix asphalt binder course hot mix
surface course shall be an IDOT approved mix. The CA-6 base course shall be compacted to a minimum ninety five percent (95%) modified
laboratory density in accordance with AASHTO T99 method A or C.

4. Recommendations as to additional/limited access, additional lanes, signalization, etc.
B. The need or requirement for a traffic impact study shall be determined during the concept or preliminary planning stage of the proposed development.
The developer/subdivider shall meet with Village of Sugar Grove officials during one of these stages for the purpose of determining the traffic study
requirements. When the Village of Sugar Grove requires that a traffic study be prepared based upon the above, the study shall include, but not be
limited to addressing the following issues:
1. Introduction: A general description of the proposed development including its size, location, the political jurisdiction in which the site is located, the
boundary limits of the study area, and any other information needed to aid in the review of the development's traffic impacts.
2. Project Description: A description of the existing and proposed land uses of the development. (If alternative land uses are being proposed, the
highest trip generation uses shall be assigned for each land use.)
3. Site Accessibility: A clear and concise description of the proposed ingress/egress points to the proposed development including a sight distance
analysis.
4. Existing External Roadway Network: A description of the existing external roadway network in the vicinity of the proposed development to include
functional classification, primary traffic control devices, signalized intersections, roadway configurations, geometric features (curves and grades),
lane usage, parking regulations, street lighting, driveways serving sites across from or adjacent to the site, and right-of-way data. (The area of
influence shall be determined by the traffic generated from the site, the trip distribution of traffic, and the trip assignment of the traffic generated by
the development over the surrounding area road network.)
5. Existing A.M., P.M. And Total Daily Traffic Volumes: Existing A.M., P.M. and total daily traffic volumes for access driveways (if existing), intersections
and the roadway network in the site vicinity shall be determined and displayed on a graphic(s) in the final report. To determine A.M. and P.M. existing
traffic volumes, machine counts and/or manual counts shall be conducted during a three (3) hour period of the morning between approximately six
o'clock (6:00) A.M. to nine o'clock (9:00) A.M. of an average or typical weekday, and between approximately three o'clock (3:00) P.M. to six o'clock
(6:00) P.M. on an average or typical weekday. Peak hour counts may be required on Saturday and/or Sunday depending on the proposed land use.
All A.M. and P.M. peak hour counts shall be recorded and summarized in fifteen (15) minute increments and included in the appendix of the final
report. Manual counts shall include vehicle classifications, i.e., passenger cars, single-unit, multi-unit trucks and buses. Traffic counts shall show both
entering and exiting traffic at the proposed access points (if existing) in addition to turning and through traffic movements at critical intersections.
6. Trip Generation Rates And Volumes: Trip generation rates and volumes for each type of proposed land use shall be determined for the A.M. and
P.M. peak hours, and total daily volumes may be required on Saturday and/or Sunday depending on the proposed land use. The trip generation rates
shall be calculated from the latest data available contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineer's "Trip Generation Manual". If trip generation
rates for a specific land use are not available from the "Trip Generation Manual", the Village of Sugar Grove shall approve the substitute rates.
7. Site Generated Trip Distribution And Assignment: The most logically traveled routes in the vicinity of the development shall be used for trip
distribution and assignment purposes. The directional distribution of site-generated traffic approaching and departing the development should be
shown in both graphic and tabular form. All assumptions used in the determination of distribution and assignment shall be clearly stated.
8. Existing Plus Site Generated Traffic Volumes: Existing plus site generated traffic volumes for the A.M., P.M. peak hours and total daily traffic for
access drives, intersections and the roadway network in the site vicinity shall be determined and displayed on a graphic(s) in the final report. Traffic
volumes shall show both entering and exiting traffic at the proposed access points in addition to turning and through traffic movements at critical
intersections.
9. Future Traffic (Existing Plus Site Generated) Volumes: Future traffic (existing plus site generated traffic volumes) for the A.M. and P.M. peak hours,
and the total daily traffic for access drives, intersections and roadway network in the site vicinity shall be determined and displayed on a graphic(s) in
the final report. Projected increases in the external (non-site related) roadway traffic must also be determined. The selection of a horizon year for
which traffic operation conditions are to be characterized may be considered as the date full buildout and occupancy is achieved. If the project is a
large multi-phased development in which several stages of development activity are planned, a number of horizon years may be required that
correspond to the bringing on line of major development phases. Horizon dates should be timed to coincide with major stages of the overall project or
to coincide with increments of area transportation system improvements.
10. Intersection Capacity Analysis: Proposed access driveways and influenced intersections shall be subject to an existing plus projected capacity
analysis. Projected traffic conditions shall include the effects of any committed developments with the influenced area. The existing and projected
levels of service derived from the analysis shall be used to aid in the evaluation of design and operation alternatives of the access driveways and
influenced intersections. The capacity analysis shall be in accordance with the techniques described in the most recent edition of the Transportation
Research Board's "Highway Capacity Manual", Special Report 209.
11. Specialization Warrants: If it is anticipated that the development's driveway(s) or existing external non-signalized intersections will satisfy signalized
warrants, a warrant analysis shall be conducted using the projected volumes determined from the trip generation. The results of such an analysis
shall be tabulated in the traffic impact study.
12. Conclusions And Recommendations: Clear and concise descriptions of the findings shall be presented in the final report. These findings shall
include all recommended improvements for access facilities, internal roadways and intersections, and external roadway and intersection
improvements. (Ord. 2018-02-20, 2-20-2018)

12-11-4-1: STORM SEWER COLLECTION AND CONVEYANCE:
A. Specifications And Design Criteria: Control of stormwater runoff and all stormwater management facilities shall be in accordance with the Kane County
stormwater ordinance, adopted by the Village.
The proposed storm sewer system shall be sized, at a minimum, to convey the stormwater runoff generated during a rainfall event with a return
frequency of not less than five (5) years. The design peak runoff shall be determined using the modified rational method. The design rainfall intensity
shall be determined from "Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 70", specifically appendix A (Aurora) and summarized below. Please note the table is only
an excerpt from Bulletin 70 appendix A for Aurora and reflects the depth of rainfall in inches and the rainfall intensity (in/hr) for a 5-year frequency in
northeastern Illinois. The provided values can be interpolated to determine incremental intensity for various times of concentrations.
5-YEAR FREQUENCY RAIN EVENT
Duration
Rainfall Depth
(Inches)
Intensity
(Inches Per Hour)
5 minutes 0.47 5.52
10 minutes 0.86 5.04
15 minutes 1.06 4.12
30 minutes 1.45 2.82
1 hour 1.85 1.79
2 hours 2.32 1.12
3 hours 2.52 0.81
6 hours 2.95 0.48
The time of concentration used to determine the design rainfall intensity shall be calculated for the fully developed condition using Worksheet 3, as
published in the SCS Technical 55 Manual.
The capacity of the storm sewer system must be determined by gravity flow only. The Village will not allow siphons or pump stations to convey
stormwater runoff. The design shall disallow the effects of surcharging, with the exception of decreases in capacity due to tail water effects on
outlets. The tailwater elevation of the receiving pond, or other body of water, to be used in storm sewer design shall be that which exists at the
specific time being evaluated.
The storm sewer must be designed to have a minimum full flow velocity of two feet (2') per second. When storm sewers of different diameters enter
or exit storm sewer structures, the controlling elevation shall be 0.8 times the respective diameters. Storm sewers smaller than the largest exit pipe
may be raised above the controlling "0.8" elevation.
The composite runoff coefficient for the area tributary to each storm sewer structure collecting surface water shall be determined by the character of
the land to be drained when fully developed using the following runoff coefficients:
Grass 0.40
Impervious surfaces 0.96
Water surfaces 1.00
Storm sewers of sufficient capacity shall be constructed throughout the entire subdivision and shall be connected to an adequate outfall. Intercepting
stormwater inlet or catch basin structures in streets shall be provided at maximum intervals such that the continuous length of flow along a gutter line
is not in excess of three hundred feet (300'), as measured along the gutter line. However, additional inlets may be required, as determined by the
Village Engineer, such that the width of flow during the design storm does not create a hazard to the motoring public. The Illinois Department of
Transportation's Drainage Manual shall be used as guidance for allowed pavement encroachment.
All stormwater runoff which flows overland into or out of a storm sewer system must enter or exit through a curb inlet, catch basin, flared end section,
slope box, or a cast in place, reinforced concrete headwall. Grates shall be required on all flared end sections twelve inch (12") diameter and larger.
The minimum diameter of all storm sewers shall be twelve inches (12"), with the exception of closed lid systems which accept no surface water and
which are solely designed for handling sump pump discharges, in which case the minimum size shall be six inch (6"). Two feet (2') minimum cover
above the top of the pipe shall be provided for all storm sewers, unless otherwise approved by the Village Engineer due to unique circumstances. No
pipe shall extend upward into the aggregate base course of a roadway.
Curb inlets, curb catch basins and rear yard catch basins shall not be constructed on storm sewers greater than eighteen inches (18") in diameter.
Storm sewer trunk lines are encouraged in rear yards and limited longitudinal installation of storm sewer under roadways may be permitted by the
Village Engineer. For each pair of curb inlet structures on opposite sides of a roadway, the downstream structure shall be a catch basin. No more
than three (3) precast concrete adjusting rings, not exceeding ten inches (10") thickness, may be used on any structure. All storm sewer structures,
other than curb inlets and curb catch basins shall be marked at the time of construction with a 4" x 4" hardwood post neatly installed vertically with a
minimum four feet (4') bury and a minimum four feet (4') exposed. The top one foot (1') of the post shall be neatly painted green.
All manholes, catch basins, and inlets shall be reinforced precast concrete and shall be sealed with butyl rope joint sealant unless approved
otherwise by the Village Engineer in high groundwater or high moisture soil areas. Storm sewer manholes shall be spaced at a general interval of
four hundred feet (400'). All manholes shall be placed near the extension of side property lines whenever possible.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=606 451/461
All stormwater from paved areas must pass through a catch basin prior to entering the storm sewer trunk line. All stormwater will also be required to
pass through a catch basin prior to entering a detention/retention pond. Inlets or catch basins with a diameter of two feet (2') will not be allowed if
more than one (1) 12-inch diameter pipe is proposed. The exception to this rule is if the other connections are four inch (4") diameter sump pump
discharge lines. All catch basins and inlets will be backfilled with CA-7 crushed limestone or crushed gravel to allow for sub-grade seepage. If subgrade
conditions are excessively wet, excessively sensitive to moisture or special conditions exist as deemed by the Village or Village Engineer, a
capped perforated pipe underdrain stubbed from the structure may be required.
The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system. Storm sewer shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete pipe (RCP) conforming to the ASTM designation C-76, Class III or better. Other materials for storm sewers may be used in special cases
upon the written approval of the Village Engineer. Any flexible pipe storm sewer systems so approved by the Village Engineer shall be subject to
mandrell testing, for all sections, thirty (30) days following installation. Existing ground water drain tiles that enter the site from other properties shall
be connected to the new storm sewer system with the use of a manhole or shall be restored to operating condition at the direction of the Village
Engineer. The design capacity of the on-site storm sewer system shall consider all flows attributed to these drain tiles so connected. Joints for all
concrete storm sewers shall be of the bituminous mastic or rubber gasket type, except when otherwise required by the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency or the Village Engineer. All storm sewers that encroach within fifteen feet (15') of any building foundation shall be "O"-ring, or other
rubber, gasketed joints as per the ASTM C-443 specification.
Street grades and lot and block drainage shall be established so as to permit positive drainage to the storm sewer system. Parking lots shall be
drained internally and directed to the storm sewer system where practical. Horseshoe drainage of individual lots should be avoided.
B. Manholes, Frames And Grates:
1. Inlet And/Or Catch Basin Castings: For M-3.12 curb and gutter under ponding or continuous grade conditions, inlet and/or catch basin frames and
grates shall be Neenah R-3501-P, EJIW 7525, or approved equal. For B-6.12 curb and gutter under ponding conditions, inlet and/or catch basin
frames and grates shall be Neenah R-3281-A, EJIW 7210 with type M2 grate and T1 back, or approved equal. For B-6.12 curb and gutter under
continuous grade conditions, inlet and/or catch basin frames and grates shall be Neenah R-3281-AL, EJIW 7210 with type M4 vane grate and T1
back, or approved equal. All curb inlet frames shall be sealed with a hydraulic cement fillet between the frame and top adjusting ring or cone section.
When additional grate capacity is needed in ponding conditions to handle the tributary flow, additional inlet structures shall be utilized. In cases
where storm sewer inlets are used in depressed barrier curb areas, use Neenah R-3339-1, EJIW 5130, or approved equal. In rear yards and all other
turf applications (except roadside ditch drainage applications) catch basins shall use Neenah R-1713 with type D cover, EJIW 1050 with type M1
radial flat grate, or approved equal. Roadside ditch drainage structures shall be evaluated on a case by case basis.
All closed storm structure lids shall have "Village of Sugar Grove" and "STORM" cast into top and shall be the concealed pick hole type.
2. Sediment Control: All storm sewer inlet structures shall utilize Flexstorm Inlet Filters™, or approved equal, to properly manage sediment control and
to minimize storm sewer televising and cleaning which would otherwise be required prior to Village acceptance of the storm sewer system. All inlet
filters shall be properly maintained until such time as all areas tributary to a particular inlet have been adequately vegetated.
3. Manhole Castings: Construction and installation of all storm sewer manholes shall comply with the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer
Main Construction in Illinois. Storm sewer structures shall be sized such that a minimum of twelve inches (12") of precast concrete structure is
provided between all pipe openings. When closed lids are needed, manhole castings shall be IDOT type 1 Neenah R-1713 frame with type B cover,
EJIW 1050, or approved equal. In paved areas, cast in place concrete blocking, a minimum of ten inches (10") thick, extending eighteen inches (18")
out from the frame is required. The surface of the concrete blocking shall be set at the elevation of the bituminous binder course. In concrete
pavement applications, the surface of the blocking shall match the finish pavement surface. When open lids are needed, use Neenah R-1713 with
type D cover, EJIW 1050 with type M1 radial flat grate, or approved equal. All type B covers shall have "Village of Sugar Grove" and "STORM" cast
into the top and shall be the concealed pick hole type.
C. Sump Pumps: The connection to the storm sewer shall be through a structure. Stubs shall be provided as appropriate for all lots and shall extend at a
minimum to the easement line to avoid excavation issues with other buried utilities. All pipe used for sump pump discharge collector lines shall be PVC
(SDR-26) of the size specified by the engineer. Sump pump discharges to a closed pipe system shall be provided with an outside air break to facilitate
flow.
All individual sump pump lines shall be connected to a storm structure or sump pump discharge collector line structure. Sump pump collection lines
shall be six inches (6") diameter minimum. Sump pump discharge collector lines shall have a cleanout/inlet structure at the upstream end and shall
have a cleanout/inlet structure every three hundred feet (300') maximum. Sump pump cleanout structures shall be two foot (2') diameter structures and
will not be allowed to pick up surface drainage. All sump connections to the cleanout/inlet structure shall be precast or core drilled and shall be sealed
inside and outside the structure with hydraulic cement. The minimum depth of cover for sump pump service lines is twenty four inches (24"). The frame
and lid shall be Neenah no. R-1706-1 or approved equal. All sump pump service stubs shall be marked at the time of construction with a 2" x 4" wood
post neatly installed vertically with the bottom set at the invert elevation of the capped stub, a minimum three feet (3') bury and a minimum four feet (4')
exposed. The top one foot (1') of the post shall be neatly painted green. (Ord. 2018-02-20, 2-20-2018)

1. Water Main Protection: Water mains and water service lines shall be protected from sanitary sewers, storm sewers, combined sewers, house sewer
service connections and drains in accordance with title 35: Environmental Protection Agency subtitle F: Public Water Supplies, chapter II:
Environmental Protection Agency, parts 651 - 654 Technical Policy Statements, section 653.119.
Whenever possible, a water main must be laid at least ten feet (10') horizontally from any existing or proposed drain or sewer line. Should local
conditions exist which would prevent a lateral separation of ten feet (10'), a water main may be laid closer than ten feet (10') to a storm or sanitary
sewer provided that the water main invert is at least eighteen inches (18") above the crown of the sewer, and is either in a separate trench or in the
same trench on an undisturbed earth shelf located to one side of the sewer. If it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal or vertical separation as
described above, then the sewer must also be constructed of water main type material (ductile iron pipe with slip-on or mechanical joints,
prestressed reinforced concrete pipe with ASTM C-443 joints, etc.) and pressure tested to the maximum expected surcharge head to assure water
tightness before backfilling.
Whenever water mains must cross house sewers, storm sewers or sanitary sewers, the water main shall be laid at such an elevation that the invert
of the water main is eighteen inches (18") above the crown of the drain or sewer. This vertical separation must be maintained for that portion of the
water main located within ten feet (10') horizontally of any sewer or drain crossed. This must be measured as the normal distance from the water
main to the drain or sewer. If it is impossible to obtain the proper vertical separation as described above or if it is necessary for the water main to
pass under a sewer or drain, then the sewer must be constructed of water main type material (as noted above). This construction must extend on
each side of the crossing until the normal distance from the water main to the sewer or drain line is at least ten feet (10'). In making such crossings,
center a length of water main pipe over/under the sewer to be crossed so that the joints will be equidistant from the sewer and as remote therefrom
as possible. Where a water main must cross under a sewer, a vertical separation of eighteen inches (18") between the invert of the sewer and the
crown of the water main shall be maintained, along with means to support the larger sized sewer lines to prevent their settling and breaking the water
main.

1. Setback between the high water level of the retention/detention basin and the building/lot: All residential development shall comply with the more
restrictive of the following requirements:
a. The high water level plus one foot (1') of freeboard shall not encroach onto a residential lot, or
b. The minimum distance between the residential building envelope and the high water level shall be fifteen feet (15').
I. Early Completion Of Detention Facilities: Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a
property, they shall be completed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. This is to ensure that if soil erosion and sediment control
practices are not adequately implemented, any eroded sediment will be captured in these areas and will have to be removed by the developer before
project completion. Note: Following construction and stabilization of stormwater management facilities, silt fencing shall be installed between the facility
and all areas of the subdivision that will have future construction activities. This silt fence shall be maintained until construction activities on all
upstream tributary areas have been completed and all such areas have been re-vegetated. All storm sewer inlets to a stormwater management facility
shall be installed to the extent that the stabilized basin and post-construction silt fence will not be disturbed by future storm sewer installation.
J. Location Of Basins: Compliance shall be made with 605 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/9-115.1 regarding the location of basins in relation to the right-ofway.
No part of the basin shall be located within a distance of ten feet (10') plus one and one-half (11/2) times the depth of the pond from the right-ofway
line.

K. Design Computations: A copy of the design computations, showing contributing areas and other necessary information shall be submitted for approval
to the Village Engineer, and shall be submitted by a registered professional engineer and sealed accordingly. All computer generated data shall also be
submitted electronically. (Ord. 2018-02-20, 2-20-2018)
12-11-5-2: DETENTION BASIN DESIGN:
All detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, so as to be safe, aesthetically pleasing, and to provide recreational use whenever
feasible. There is no depth limitation to basin design, other than that necessitated by impoundment volume safety and/or vegetative survivability and
maintenance concerns due to longer drawdown times.
A. Wet Basin Depths: The normal water pool in wet basins shall be at least six feet (6') deep, excluding near shore banks and safety ledges and shall be at
least ten feet (10') deep over twenty five percent (25%) of the normal water level surface area.
B. Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume at normal depth shall be equal to or greater than the runoff from its watershed for the 2-year
event.
C. Life Saving Equipment: The subdivider shall install life-saving equipment at regular intervals around the perimeter of wet detention/retention ponds. The
subdivider shall consult with the Police Department and the fire protection district regarding the type of equipment to be installed. The equipment shall
be maintained by the entity that maintains the pond.
D. Dry Detention Ponds: Dry detention ponds shall be designed to have a high water depth of four feet (4') or less. Parking lots used for stormwater
detention shall not allow ponding greater than six inches (6") deep for a period of four (4) hours. All slopes shall not be steeper than 4 to 1 (horizontal to
vertical).
E. Dry Basins: Dry basins shall be designed so that at least eighty percent (80%) of the bottom area shall have standing water no longer than seventy two
(72) hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Underdrains directed to the outlet control shall be used to aid in keeping the pond bottom
dry.
F. Aeration: All wet basins shall incorporate wind powered aeration systems to oxygenate the normal water pool. If it can be shown, based on a sheltered
location of the basin, that wind powered aeration is not feasible, then an electric powered aeration system will be allowed.
G. Basin Slopes: The underwater side slopes of wet basins from the safety ledge to the high water elevation shall not be steeper than 4 to 1 (horizontal to
vertical). All side slopes above normal water level shall be no steeper than 4 to 1 (horizontal to vertical). Backslopes on the side of a berm opposite the
basin may be 3 to 1 if they are along the external boundary of a development and no/low maintenance groundcovers and landscaping are installed.
H. Safety Ledges: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least five feet (5') in width from the normal water's edge and three feet (3')
below the normal water level.
I. Desiltation Basins: Desiltation basins shall be provided at the pond's in-flow locations. Desiltation basin size shall be one hundred (100) cubic yards per
acre of disturbed tributary area. Use of settlement basins or other sediment control practices upstream of the basins shall be taken into consideration
when reviewing the proposed desiltation volume.
J. Embankment Protection: Embankment protection shall be provided and approved by the Village Engineer.
K. Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize
the re-suspension of pollutants.
L. Inlet And Outlet Orientation For Both Wet And Dry Detention Basins: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be
maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. (Ord. 2018-02-20, 2-20-2018)
12-11-6: GRADING:
12-11-6-1: GENERAL:
Every engineering plan shall include a topographic survey of the existing project site and shall be signed and sealed by a licensed Illinois professional land
surveyor. All topographic data shall be collected a minimum of fifty feet (50') beyond the project site, but in no case less than is necessary to determine all
area drainage patterns that may effect, or be affected by construction of the subdivision. All plans shall indicate the existing contours with one foot (1')
contour interval. The existing contours and spot elevations must be indicated on the plans in a lighter line style or shade to provide distinction between the
existing and proposed conditions. All topographic surveys shall provide bench mark information and shall be based on NGVD 1988.
The minimum slope for all vegetated areas shall be two percent (2%) unless approved by the Village Engineer under special conditions. The maximum
slope for all transition areas shall be twenty five percent (25%).
Minimum slopes for parking areas shall be 0.50 percent and the maximum slopes shall be 4.0 percent. All parking areas that are adjacent to, and slope
toward, stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed with guardrails or sufficient structural parking stops to minimize or preclude the possibility of

unattended vehicles rolling into the detention facility.
All grading plans shall indicate proposed spot elevations at a minimum of every fifty feet (50'). The calculated slope shall be shown with an arrow in the
direction of the downward slope. Overland flood routes shall be shown with large arrows to depict the route.
Rim elevations for all storm sewer structures shall be shown on the grading plans. (Ord. 2018-02-20, 2-20-2018)
12-11-6-2: RETAINING WALLS:
Should a site require a retaining wall, a detail shall be indicated on the plans to indicate the type and style of wall to be used. A retaining wall that is greater
than three feet (3') in height shall be designed and sealed by an Illinois licensed professional engineer. The design criteria can be provided during the final
engineering submittal.
Retaining walls around detention basins may not be continuous. There must be a sloped opening to allow for maintenance. Walls greater than three feet
(3') in height are not permitted in this application. If a height of greater than three feet (3') must be attained, the wall must be constructed in a terrace
fashion, three foot (3') maximum high wall to a minimum three foot (3') wide terrace, then another three feet (3') maximum wall to another minimum three
feet (3') wide terrace, etc.
The underdrain outlet shall be shown on the plans. The ends of the retaining wall shall transition so that the grading shall not exceed the maximum
transition grading of 4:1. (Ord. 2018-02-20, 2-20-2018)
