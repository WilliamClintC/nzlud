2.45.060 Criteria for approval of applicants.
Review shall be guided by the following:

(1) Competent Design. Development has been designed by and bears the signature of a person who under the building code has been designated as legally competent to submit such development proposal. The overall design may be directed towards buildings of any architectural characteristic. However, there must be a consistent organization of materials and openings, and a harmonious relationship of major elements; and decorative parts must relate to the character of the design.

(2) Relationship between Structures within the Development and between Structures and Site. There shall be a harmonious and pleasing relationship between the various structures of the development on the site and between the structures and the site itself. The proposed structures should be designed to fit the site and not vice versa.

(3) Relationship between Development and Neighborhood. Proposed structures and site development shall be related harmoniously and have good space and relationship to the terrain and to existing structures and development in the vicinity. The design shall show that due regard has been given to orientation of structures to streets, climatic considerations, and especially, the creation and utilization of open space. Overdevelopment of the site shall be avoided.

(4) Materials and Colors Used. Soft and muted colors in the earthtone and woodtone range and natural materials are preferred and generally should predominate. Other colors and materials may be accepted if the applicant can demonstrate that they are appropriate to the style, are appropriate accent colors, and are harmonious with the site or compatible with the character of the neighborhood.

(a) Earthtone colors are considered to be various shades of reddish-brown, brown, tan, ocher, umber, gold, sand and green. The following are ordinarily not so considered: blue, canary yellow, red, orange, violet, magenta, bright green, silver, gray or metallic finishes.

(b) Natural materials include adobe, slump block brick, stone, redwood, exterior wood wall covering, or wood shakes and shingles.

(c) Windows and Glass. Bronzetone or other glare reducing and color harmonizing finishes may be required on glass surfaces when they constitute 50 percent or more of a wall or building face, when such wall or face is exposed to the direct rays of the sun for any substantial part of the daylight hours. Similar treatment is to be used to reduce see-through capacity where glass surfaces would otherwise permit a view of pipes, utilities and other service units attached to a ceiling or roof. Mirror-type glass shall be avoided.

(d) Roofs (including equipment, but excluding skylights) are to be composed of nonglossy earthtone or woodtone finishes that minimize reflectivity.

(e) Metal Buildings or Finishes. Unpainted metal, galvanized metal or metal subject to ordinary rusting may not be used. Galvanized metal may be used in areas that are zoned in the industrial classifications. Metals that develop an attractive oxidized finish may be used: copper or weathering steel are examples of such materials.

(f) Concrete surfaces must be colored, textured, sculptured, patterned and/or serve a design function as opposed to a mere structural function.

(5) Wall, fences or screening shall be employed in a skillful manner and in harmony with the design of the development to conceal and to screen parking and loading areas, garbage and refuse collection areas and mechanical equipment from public view from adjoining streets, from persons residing on or working in the development, or from persons residing or working in the neighborhood.

(6) Surface Water Drainage. Special attention shall be given to proper site surface drainage. Stormwaters shall be removed and carried away in an adequate drainage system. Surface water and all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it will not obstruct the flow of vehicles or pedestrian traffic and will not create puddles on the paved areas.

(7) Drives, Parking and Circulation. With respect to vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation (including walkways, interior drives and parking) special attention shall be given to location and number of access points to the public streets, open space areas, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient insofar as practical. Such facilities should not detract from the design of the proposed buildings and structures or from adjoining or neighboring properties. The effect of the development on adjoining sites and properties must be considered and the loading capacities of adjoining streets must also be considered.

(8) Utility Service. Utility connections shall be installed underground. Proposed method of sanitary sewage disposal for all buildings shall be indicated. Adequate garbage and refuse collection areas shall be mandatory and designed to prevent scatter and located in areas convenient both to users and to persons who make collections and be of sufficient size and properly screened. There shall be adequate ingress and egress to all utilities.

(9) Signs, when submitted as part of the development, shall be so designed as to be skillfully integrated into the development and not detract from the overall appearance of the project or of surrounding areas or developments.

(10) Exterior Lighting. Light sources shall not create a glare or hazard on adjoining streets or be annoying to adjacent properties or residential areas. The location of lights and electric conduits in the landscaped areas shall be coordinated with the landscaping and irrigation plans.

(11) Landscaping shall be well designed with appropriate variations and shall be included as an integral enhancement of the site and, where needed, for screening purposes. Plant materials shall be suitable for the functions to be served. Irrigation systems may be required, and their location shall be coordinated with the plans for the location of plants. All landscaping shall be maintained in good condition and any dead or dying plants, bushes, or trees shall be replaced with new healthy stock of a size compatible with the remainder of the growth at the time of replacement.

(12) Temporary visual and air pollution resulting from construction shall be minimized through retention of natural vegetation, rock formations and topography until applicant is prepared, once he starts grading, to continue immediately with the construction applied for through to completion as one continuous process. The period of construction shall be of duration reasonable to the size and complexity of the development. During grading, dust prevention must be emphasized to avoid unnecessary annoyance to persons living or working in the area.

(13) Any or all of the above criteria may be waived by the planning commission in developments showing exceptional design merit, which carry out the objectives of this chapter and which are consistent with the general plan. [Ord. 520-76 § 14, 1-12-76. Prior code § 2-96].

2.45.070 Approval, conditions, and guarantees.
(1) An application for design review may be approved, approved with modifications, conditionally approved or disapproved.

(2) The city may require the applicant contract with the city to complete the development proposed in accordance with the design review approval given, and also may require the posting of a bond to guarantee performance, which shall be in such amount as the city may fix.

(3) An approved application and all other related and approved maps, drawings, and other supporting materials constituting a part of the approved applications shall be so endorsed by the city manager or his authorized representative.

(4) The building official shall review construction drawings, final plans, and other similar documents for compliance with the approved design review, and conditions attached thereto, or any approved or required modifications thereof. He shall when performing building inspections on the site also inspect for compliance with design review requirements. [Ord. 520-76 § 15, 1-12-76. Prior code § 2-97].

2.45.080 Dedication and improvement.
Dedication, relocation, installation and/or improvement of rights-of-way may be required where essential to prevent congestion and/or hazards which may result from the use of land proposed. [Ord. 520-76 § 16, 1-12-76. Prior code § 2-98].

2.45.090 Noncompliance.
(1) In addition to any other fines, penalties or enforcement provisions set forth in this code, failure to comply in any respect with an approved design review application shall constitute grounds for the immediate stoppage of the work involved in said noncompliance.

(2) An occupancy permit shall not be issued in part or whole for any building or group of buildings subject to design review unless and until the work specified in the design review approval has been completed, including landscaping. If for any valid reason full compliance cannot be made, a cash bond shall be posted for the work to be completed within a reasonable period of time as determined by the city manager or his authorized representative. [Ord. 520-76 § 17, 1-12-76. Prior code § 2-99].

2.45.100 Revocation, expiration and extension of approval.
(1) When demolition or removal of any existing structure is a part of design review approval, said demolition or removal shall be completed and all debris removed from the site within 90 days of design review approval or the entire design review permit shall be deemed to have expired for cause as of midnight on the ninetieth day unless the building official shall grant an extension of time for such work.

(2) Design review permits shall expire in one year unless a different expiration date or unlimited expiration is stipulated at the time of approval. Prior to the expiration of a design review approval, the applicant may apply to the building official for an extension of not more than one year from the original date of expiration. The building official shall grant the extension, and may make minor modifications of the approved design at the time of extension, if he finds that there has been no substantial change in the factual circumstances surrounding the originally approved design. Any further extension beyond one year shall require planning commission approval. [Ord. 520-76 § 18, 1-12-76. Prior code § 2-100].

Except as otherwise provided herein, purchases and contracts for supplies and equipment of estimated value greater than $5,000 shall be by written contract with the lowest responsible bidder utilizing procedures pursuant to this section:

(1) Information on Notice Inviting Bids. Notices inviting bids shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased or sold, shall state where bid blanks and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids.

(2) Publishing Notice Inviting Bids. Notice inviting bids shall be published at least 10 days before the date of opening of the bids. Notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in the city, or if there is none, it shall be posted in at least three public places in the city that have been designated by ordinance as the places for posting public notices.

(3) Lowest Responsible Bidder. “Lowest responsible bidder” as used in this chapter shall mean that bidder which best responds in price, quality, service, fitness, or capacity to the particular requirements of the city. Price alone shall not be the determining factor but shall be considered along with the other factors including, but not limited to, the ability of the bidder to deliver, availability of parts or service, prior experience with the bidder, and other factors relating to the particular needs of the city for the supplies or equipment to be purchased.

(4) Bidder’s Security May Be Required. When deemed necessary by the purchasing officer, bidder’s security may be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security; provided, that a successful bidder shall forfeit his bid security upon refusal or failure to execute the contract within 10 days after the notice of award of contract has been mailed, unless the city is responsible for the delay. The city council may, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the city council so awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security shall be applied by the city to the difference between the low bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder.

(8) Bidder’s Oath. For either the purchase or sale of supplies, services and equipment, the purchasing agent shall require each bidder to accompany his bid with a statement made under oath that he has not been a party with other bidders to an agreement to bid a fixed or uniform price. Violation of such statement shall render void the bid of such bidders. Any disclosure to, or acquisition by, a competitive bidder, in advance of the opening of the bids, of the terms or conditions of the bid submitted by another competitor shall render the proceedings void and shall require readvertising for bids.

(9) Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the purchasing officer and shall be identified as bids on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than 30 calendar days after the bid opening.

(12) Tie Bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the city council may accept the one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening.

(13) Performance Bonds. The city council shall have authority to require a performance bond before entering a contract in such amount as it shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the city. If the city council requires a performance bond, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids.

(14) Debarment of Irresponsible Bidders. The purchasing agent may determine and declare a bidder to be irresponsible for reasons indicated in this section, may remove his name from the bidder’s list, and may debar him from bidding for a reasonable period, or not less than one year. Such debarred bidder shall be notified in writing of such action and shall be furnished with a statement of the reasons therefor. [Ord. 529-77, 10-25-77; Ord. 419 § 10, 9-13-65.

The purchasing officer shall have authority to transfer any such commodities which are usable to another department in lieu of filling requisitions for the purchase of new and additional stock of the same or similar articles.

The purchasing agent of the city council shall have authority to sell all such supplies, materials and equipment which cannot be used by any agency and which have been found by the city council not to be required for public use or to exchange or trade in such articles in part of full payment for new supplies, materials or equipment of a similar nature. Any such sale, exchange or trade-in shall be made in accordance with WMC 3.05.090 or 3.05.100, whichever is applicable. [Ord. 419 § 13, 9-13-65. Prior code § 6-57].

(2) The offer of any such gratuity to any official or employee of the city by any vendor or contractor, or prospective vendor or contractor, shall be cause for declaring such individual or firm to be an irresponsible bidder and for debarring him from bidding. [Ord. 419 § 16, 9-13-65. Prior code § 6-60].

(4) To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will be, to the degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 499-73 § 4, 9-11-73. Prior code § 15-28].

3.15.050 Contract with state.
Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax ordinance; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

This chapter shall be known as the hotel users tax ordinance of the city of Willows. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 1, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-61].

3.25.020 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:

“Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by hotel users for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, bed and breakfast, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or other lodging including but not limited to a camping site or a space at a campground or recreational vehicle park.

“Hotel user” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a hotel user until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a hotel user, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered.

“Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

“Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his function through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

“Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

“Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

“Tax administrator” means the city treasurer. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 640-94, 1-11-94; Ord. 602-85 § 2, 12-10-85; Ord. 462 § 2, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-62].

3.25.030 Tax imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each hotel user is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 12 percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the hotel user to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or city. The hotel user shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the hotel user ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the tax administrator. [Ord. 706-12, 11-27-12; Ord. 665-00, 12-12-00; Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 631-91, 9-24-91. Prior code § 15-63].

3.25.040 Exemptions.
Timeshare and specific campgrounds as stated in California Revenue and Taxation Code 7280. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 640-94, 1-11-94. Prior code § 15-64].

3.25.050 Operator’s duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every hotel user. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each hotel user shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 5, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-65].

3.25.060 Registration.
Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within 30 days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to hotel users shall register said hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from the tax administrator a hotel users registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

(1) The name of the operator;

(2) The address of the hotel;

(3) The date upon which the certificate was issued;

(4)

This Hotel Users Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Hotel Users Tax Ordinance by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from hotel users the hotel users tax and remitting said tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable law, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.

[Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 6, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-66].

3.25.070 Reporting and remitting.
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for hotel users’ occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder in order to ensure collection of the tax and the tax administrator may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon a cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 7, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-67].

3.25.080 Penalties and interest.
(1) Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

(2) Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the 10 percent penalty first imposed.

(3) Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

(4) Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

(5) Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed, and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section, shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 8, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-68].

3.25.090 Failure to collect and report tax – Determination of tax by tax administrator.
(1) If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner deemed best to obtain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information upon which to base the assessments of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the tax administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a note of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.

(2) Such operator may, within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.

(3) At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in WMC 3.25.100. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 9, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-69].

3.25.100 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at operator’s last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 10, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-70].

3.25.110 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as the operator may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 11, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-71].

(1) Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within 90 days of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

(2) An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received, when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a hotel user; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the hotel user or credited to rent subsequently payable by the hotel user to the operator.

(3) A hotel user may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the hotel user directly to the tax administrator, or when the hotel user, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the hotel user has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

(4) No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. [Ord. 658-98, 5-12-98; Ord. 462 § 12, 11-12-68. Prior code § 15-72].

[Ord. 619-88, 11-8-88. Prior code § 19-10].

5.15.110 Transfer of ownership or control.
(1) Transfer of Franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public.

(2) Ownership or Control. The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any proposed change in, transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of the grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to major partners or stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or transfer by any person or group of persons of 25 percent of the aggregate partnership interests in or voting shares of the grantee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto, except as provided in subsection (1) of this section. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the city in any such inquiry. In seeking the city’s consent to any change in ownership or control of the grantee, the grantee shall have the responsibility to establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the city:

(a) Whether the proposed purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the “proposed transferee”) which, in the case of a partnership or corporation, shall include all partners, officers, directors, and all persons having a legal or equitable interest in five percent or more of its partnership interests or voting stock, or any of the proposed transferee’s principals:

(i) Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral turpitude or is presently under an indictment, investigation, or complaint charging such acts; or

(ii) Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud or misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of competent jurisdiction; or

(iii) Has pending against it, her, him, or them any legal claim, lawsuit, or administrative proceeding arising out of or involving a cable communications system; and

(b) Whether the proposed transferee has the financial and technical capability to enable it to maintain and operate the cable communications system for the remaining term of the franchise under the existing franchise provisions.

(3) Right of Lender to Operate System. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the cable communications system operating under authority of such franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it or its designee satisfactory to the city will take control and operate the cable communications system in the event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the city in its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another grantee. If, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical, and other public interest qualities of the proposed transferee, the city finds that such transfer is satisfactory, the city will approve the transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise to such proposed transferee.

(4) No Transfer before Completion of Construction. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction or reconstruction of the proposed cable communications system.

(5) Transferee to Assume Grantee’s Obligations under Franchise. In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest to the grantee assuming all of the grantee’s obligations under its franchise. Notwithstanding the requirements of the grantee’s franchise, the city may require, as a condition of the transfer of such franchise, that the proposed transferee furnish either or both a security fund and a performance bond in such amount or amounts as the city shall designate.

(6) Permitted Encumbrances. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the grantee may pledge, assign, hypothecate, or create a security interest in its franchise without the consent of the city in favor of any bank, financial institution, or other lender with respect to any indebtedness of the grantee to such person.

[Ord. 692-11 § 1, 2-22-11; Ord. 481-71, 3-8-71. Prior code § 8-47].

Article IV. Waste Disposal Sites

8.05.190 Definition of dwelling unit.
For the purposes of this article, a “dwelling unit” is defined to be, mean and designate a building, structure or enclosure, or a portion thereof, whether or not affixed to the land by a permanent type of foundation or footing, consisting of one or more habitable rooms which are occupied or which are intended or designated to be occupied by one or more persons as a family for living, sleeping, cooking and eating. A “mobile home,” as defined in Section 18008 of the Health and Safety Code, is a “dwelling unit” for the purposes of this article. A “recreational vehicle,” a “commercial coach,” and a “travel trailer,” as defined in Sections 18011.5, 18012, and 18013 of the Health and Safety Code, are not deemed to be “dwelling units” for the purposes of this article. A hotel, motel, rooming house, lodging house, or boardinghouse having only one kitchen or cooking facility shall be deemed to be a single dwelling unit. Two or more dwelling units may be located in a single building or structure commonly designated as a flat, duplex, triplex, multiplex, motel, apartment house or apartment building.

8.05.200 Determination of factors relating waste disposal fee to land classification.
This city council determined that in the city of Willows solid waste materials are primarily created by people who are residents of the city and not by particular business, industries, commercial enterprises, agricultural pursuits or land uses. In other words, it is found by the city council that there is a direct relationship between the volume of solid wastes generated within the city and the number of families permanently residing in the city. It is further determined that the cost and expense of acquiring, operating and maintaining solid waste disposal sites for the city of Willows, in a manner compatible with good public health and environmental practices, should be borne directly by those who create the waste disposal problem. Therefore, for the purposes of solid waste disposal, all lands within the city are classified according to those parcels upon which dwelling units are situated and those parcels upon which dwelling units are not situated without regard to other land use, zoning, assessed valuation or other criteria. [Ord. 488-72, 8-31-72. Prior code § 8-62].

8.05.210 Fees for acquisition and operation of waste disposal site.
Each year the city council, by resolution, shall impose an annual fee for the ensuing fiscal year upon each dwelling unit, whether or not inhabited, occupied or tenanted, located on land within the city, the revenue from which shall be used only for the acquisition, operation and maintenance of city waste disposal sites and for financing waste collection, processing, reclamation, and disposal services. [Ord. 488-72, 8-31-72. Prior code § 8-63].

8.05.220 Billing by tax collector.
The tax collector shall prepare a bill or statement in appropriate form for each such parcel which will indicate the amount of the annual waste disposal fee, computed by multiplying the dwelling unit fee, as fixed by the city of Willows, by the number of dwelling units located on the parcel, and enclose such statement with the regular property tax bill for such parcel for that fiscal year. [Ord. 488-72, 8-31-72. Prior code § 8-64].

8.05.230 Payment of waste disposal fees.

However, irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

Article I. General Provisions

9.20.010 Findings.
(1) The Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Section 841 et seq.) makes it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense or possess cannabis, and, accordingly, medical and nonmedical cannabis dispensaries and retail businesses are illegal under federal law;

(2) In 2013, Deputy U.S. Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors to provide guidance on the enforcement of the Federal Controlled Substances Act as it related to cannabis, indicating that enforcement would not be a priority in states and local jurisdictions that have laws authorizing cannabis-related conduct; that have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety, public health, and other law enforcement interests; and that have provided the necessary resources to demonstrate the willingness to enforce their laws and regulations;

(3) In 2015, Congress began to defund enforcement of the Federal Controlled Substances Act in states where such enforcement activities would prevent states from implementing their own state laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis;

(4) The voters of the state of California approved Proposition 215 (codified as Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 et seq., “The Compassionate Use Act of 1996” or “CUA”); the intent of Proposition 215 was to enable persons who are in need of cannabis for medical purposes to obtain and use it without fear of state criminal prosecution;

(5) On October 9, 2015, Governor Brown approved a series of bills commonly referred to as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MCRSA”), effective on January 1, 2016, which established a comprehensive state licensing and regulatory framework for the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of medical cannabis, also known as marijuana; and which recognizes the authority of local jurisdictions to either impose additional restrictions or prohibit certain activities related to the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, delivery, and sale of medical cannabis;

(6) On November 8, 2016, the voters of the state of California approved Proposition 64, known as the “Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act” (“AUMA”), which established a comprehensive state licensing and regulatory framework for the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of recreational cannabis, also known as marijuana; and which recognized the authority of local jurisdictions to either impose additional restrictions or regulate or prohibit certain activities related to the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution, delivery, and sale of recreational cannabis;

(7) On June 27, 2017, Governor Brown signed into law SB 94, a bill which, among other things, reconciled differences between MCRSA and AUMA, and established a new statutory framework regulating medical and nonmedical cannabis use, possession, cultivation and commercial activities in the state of California (referred to as “MAUCSRA”);

(8) The city council of the city of Willows has recognized, and continues to recognize, the potential adverse impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of its residents and business from secondary effects associated with commercial cannabis activity, which include: offensive odors, trespassing, theft, violent encounters between growers and persons attempting to steal plants, fire hazards, increased crime in and about points of sale, robberies of customers, negative impacts on nearby businesses, nuisance problems, and increased DUI incidents;

(9) There is a need to adopt health, safety, and welfare regulations to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts on the community which may arise from commercial cannabis activity;

(10) The MCRSA, AUMA and MAUCRSA set forth a comprehensive framework to regulate cannabis and cannabis products from seed to use or ingestion by a consumer, which includes uniform health and safety standards designed to implement quality control, a labeling and a track-and-trace program, and other consumer protections, which mitigates against some of the potential adverse impacts identified by the city council; and

(11) An effective regulatory system governing cannabis in the city of Willows as provided in this chapter, will address potential adverse impacts to the public health, welfare, and safety, thereby allowing commercial cannabis activity and other use of cannabis and cannabis products consistent with California law. [Ord. 736-17 § 7 (Exh. B), 11-28-17].

9.20.015 Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter for the city council to exercise its police powers derived from Section 7 of Article XI of the California Constitution and state law to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents and businesses of the city of Willows by regulating cannabis activities within the city’s jurisdictional limits, unless preempted by federal or state law.

REGULATION OF BUTANE RESALES
Sections:

9.25.010    Legal authority and title.

9.25.020    Findings and purpose.

9.25.030    Definitions.

9.25.040    Unlawful sale, purchase and handling of butane.

9.25.060    Penalties, strict liability, and nuisance.

9.25.070    Cumulative remedy.

9.25.010 Legal authority and title.
Under the authority granted in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution and Government Code Sections 36900 and 36901, the city of Willows, by and through its council, does enact this chapter of the municipal code, which shall be known as the butane resale regulation. [Ord. 725-16 § 2, 7-26-16].

9.25.020 Findings and purpose.
(1) The northern region of our state has experienced a recent increase in explosions caused by the manufacture of honey oil (also known as hash oil) in clandestine labs using five times refined (5X) butane. These incidents have caused considerable property damage, personal injury and even death to those participating in the manufacturing process and to innocent bystanders.

(2) (5X) refined butane is used to dissolve the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) resin, which concentrates into a liquid/oil form as a result of the butane’s stripping process. The stripping of the THC through the use of refined butane causes flammable butane vapors to accumulate low to the ground and remain exposed to ignition sources. Studies suggest that 99.5 percent of the extracted THC butane mixture will volatilize into the immediate area and find an ignition source if (5X) refined butane and higher is used.

(3) A honey oil lab using (5X) refined butane and higher presents a serious hazard for first responders as the gas has no odor and can only be detected by a combustible gas instrument. Such conditions present grave risk of loss where devices such as a Taser are capable of igniting the gas resulting in an explosion.

(4) The resale of (5X) refined butane occurs at levels sufficient to aid the manufacture of honey oil. Such sales and possession of butane should be regulated to prevent the use of butane in the manufacture of honey oil where such activity presents grave dangers to the people of the city of Willows and the first responders therein. [Ord. 725-16 § 2, 7-26-16].

9.25.030 Definitions.

“Sell” means to furnish, give away, exchange, transfer, deliver, surrender, distribute or supply, whether for monetary gain or other consideration.

(2) It is unlawful for any person that is not a reseller or wholesaler to have in their possession, custody or control in the city of Willows any number of butane canisters that exceed a combined total storage quantity of 600 ml (20.3 oz) of butane at any one time.

(3) It is unlawful for any customer to purchase or acquire in the city of Willows any number of butane canisters that exceed a combined total storage quantity of 600 ml (20.3 oz) of butane per calendar month, whether sold individually or by the package. [Ord. 725-16 § 2, 7-26-16].

9.25.050 Tracking of butane sales.
(1) For every sale of butane, every reseller shall prepare a bill of sale that identifies the date of the sale, quantity of butane purchased, and the customer’s identification. The customer’s identification as used herein shall mean a person’s first and last name as verified from a valid driver’s license or other official and valid state-issued identification that contains a photograph of the customer and a residential or mailing address. Resellers shall retain a copy of the bill of sale in readable form for a period of two years.

(2) It shall be unlawful for any reseller to sell butane to any customer without complying with this section.

(3) Upon written request, a reseller shall provide copies of the records described in this section to the city of Willows. [Ord. 725-16 § 2, 7-26-16].

(3) Delinquent Fines and Late Payment Penalty. Fines shall be delinquent after 30 days of issuance of citation. Delinquent notices shall be issued when fine becomes delinquent. A late payment of 50 percent of the fine shall be incurred 10 days after delinquent notice is mailed. [Ord. 641-94, 3-22-94. Prior code § 16-170].

10.50.320 Payment procedures.
(1) Fines may be paid in person by cash, check or money order at Willows City Hall during normal working hours.

(2) Fines may also be paid by check or money order by mail. Checks or money orders will serve the violator as a receipt.

(3) Termination of Action. Once fines have been received by the city, no further actions will be taken concerning the notice of violation. The terminated notices will be placed on file at the Willows police department as with other public records. [Ord. 638-93, 10-12-93. Prior code § 16-171].

10.50.330 Administrative review/hearing.
(1) For a period of 30 days from issuance of the notice of violation or 10 days from the mailing of the notice of delinquent violation a person may request an administrative review of the violation by mail or telephone. The review shall be conducted by the chief of police or his designee.

(2) If the person is dissatisfied with the results of that review, he or she may contest it by depositing with the city the amount of the fine along with a written request for an administrative hearing, detailing an explanation for the reason to contest the violation. This request must be filed with the chief of police within 10 days of the results of the administrative review.

(3) Photostatic or electronic copies of violations may be ordered by violators who have lost or claim nonreceipt of notices. The police department may charge a fee sufficient to cover the costs of such copies. [Ord. 641-94, 3-22-94. Prior code § 16-172].

10.50.340 Issuing procedures for notices of parking violations.
No person, except the chief of police or his designee, through the placement of temporary authorizing signs, may alter the provisions of any parking restrictions. No person, especially an enforcement officer, may authorize anyone to violate parking rules or regulations. [Ord. 641-94, 3-22-94. Prior code § 16-173].

10.50.350 Delivery of notice – Affixing notice.
(1) If a vehicle is attended during the time the enforcement officer is issuing the notice of violation, the officer will deliver the notice in person.

(2) If the vehicle is unattended, the officer will affix the completed notice either under the windshield wiper or in another conspicuous place so as to be observable by the driver upon the return of that person. The citation must be affixed to the vehicle so that it will not be blown away and will be visible to the driver when they return.

(3) If, for any reason, the driver removes the vehicle and leaves the area while the officer is in the process of issuing the notice, it shall be mailed upon receipt of an address from Department of Motor Vehicles check. The notice will indicate these circumstances.

(4) No person, including the issuing officer, is authorized to alter, conceal or destroy any notice once it has been initiated. [Ord. 638-93, 10-12-93. Prior code § 16-174].

10.50.360 Form of notice of violation.
Notices lacking required information or incorrect information may be dismissed outright by a hearing officer. This is called summary dismissal and occurs because the city has failed to adequately establish a prima facie case.

(1) Violation identification.

(2) Approximate time.

(3) Location.

(4) Vehicle licence number.

10.50.370 Prima facie case.
A notice of violation that contains the statutorily required information (as outlined in WMC 10.50.360) is considered to establish a prima facie case. To rebut this, a respondent must be able to present credible and sufficient evidence to doubt the validity of the information listed. [Ord. 638-93, 10-12-93. Prior code § 16-176].

10.50.380 Seizure of vehicle.
Any vehicle cited five or more times within any period of five or more days and to which the owner has not responded may be seized or immobilized. [Ord. 638-93, 10-12-93. Prior code § 16-177].

10.50.390 Notice requirements.
A registered owner must be notified whenever a violation issued to the vehicle is delinquent. This may be satisfied when the processing agency mails a notice to the last known address of the owner on file at the Department of Motor Vehicles. [Ord. 638-93, 10-12-93. Prior code § 16-178].

10.50.400 Leased and rented vehicles.
The registered owner of a vehicle may transfer responsibility for the violation to a lessee or renter but only if the name, address and California driver license number are provided to the processing agency within 10 days of the mail date of the delinquent notice. If this is not done, there is no requirement to transfer responsibility. [Ord. 641-94, 3-22-94. Prior code § 16-179].

Said assessment shall be due and payable at the same time as said property taxes are due and payable and, if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum. [Ord. 459 § 9, 9-10-68. Prior code § 13-96].

13.15.100 Responsibility of city.
The city shall remove at its own expense all city-owned equipment from all poles required to be removed hereunder in ample time to enable the owner or user of such poles to remove the same within the time specified in the resolution enacted pursuant to WMC 13.15.030. [Ord. 459 § 10, 9-10-68. Prior code § 13-97].

13.15.110 Extension of time.

15.65.060    Variance procedure.

15.65.010 Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods.
(1) Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Willows does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

(2) Findings of Fact.

(a) The flood hazard areas of the city of Willows are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

(b) These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.

(3) Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

(a) Protect human life and health;

(b) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(c) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(d) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(e) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

(f) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

(g) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

(h) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

(4) Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:

(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

(d) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;

(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. [Ord. 682-09 § 1, 5-26-09; Ord. 614-87, 11-10-87. Prior code § 4-201].

15.65.020 Definitions.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before May 20, 1980.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood,” “flooding,” or “flood water” means:

(a) A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

“Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization,” as related to WMC 15.65.060, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for state of California, Glenn County, dated December 1979 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated September 3, 1980, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at City Hall, 201 N Lassen Street, Willows, CA 95988.

(3) Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(4) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

(5) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

(a) Considered as minimum requirements;

(b) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(c) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

(6) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city council of the city of Willows, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(7) Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. [Ord. 682-09 § 3, 5-26-09; Ord. 662-99, 4-27-99; Ord. 643-95, 2-14-95; Ord. 614-87, 11-10-87. Prior code § 4-203].

15.65.040 Administration.
(1) Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The city of Willows building official is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.

(2) Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include but not be limited to the following:

(a) Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

(i) Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

(ii) All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

(iii) The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

(iv) The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Willows; and

(v) All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

(b) Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

(i) Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

(ii) Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

(c) Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with WMC 15.65.030(2), the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer WMC 15.65.050.

NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations,” dated July 1995.

(d) Notification of Other Agencies.

(i) Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:

(A) Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

(B) Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

(C) Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

(ii) Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations.

(A) Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

(B) All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

Such submissions are necessary so that, upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

(iii) Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

(5) Standards for Recreational Vehicles.

(a) All recreational vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either:

(i) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

(iii) Meet the permit requirements of WMC 15.65.040(3) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (4)(a) of this section.

(6) Floodways. Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(a) Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Willows.

(b) Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Willows shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(c) If subsections (6)(a) and (b) of this section are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. [Ord. 682-09 § 5, 5-26-09; Ord. 662-99, 4-27-99; Ord. 643-95, 2-14-95; Ord. 614-87, 11-10-87. Prior code § 4-205].

15.65.060 Variance procedure.
(1) Nature of Variances. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the city of Willows to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

(2) Conditions for Variances.

(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of WMC 15.65.040 and 15.65.050 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (as defined in WMC 15.65.020) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(c) Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city of Willows city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter.

(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

(i) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and

(ii) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the County of Glenn county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

(f) The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

(3) Appeal Board.

(a) In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

(i) Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(ii) Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(iii) Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

(iv) Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(v) Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(vi) Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

(vii) Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(viii) Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(ix) Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(x) Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

(xi) Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

(b) Variances shall only be issued upon a:

(i) Showing of good and sufficient cause;

(ii) Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

(iii) Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see definition of “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(c) Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections (3)(a) through (d) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

(d) Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (3)(a) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Article I. General

17.55.010 General.
The purpose of these standards is to specifically define the minimum standards and procedures required for the subdivision and/or improvement of land within the city of Willows.

Improvement of subdivisions for which parcel maps are filed shall be limited to dedication of rights-of-way and easements and the construction of reasonable on-site and off-site improvements to serve the parcels being created. Only those portions of these standards which are pertinent to these dedications and improvements shall be applicable to subdivisions for which parcel maps are filed.

Improvement of subdivisions for which final maps are filed shall include, but is not limited to, dedication of streets, public ways and easements, grading, surfacing, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, culverts, bridges, storm drains, sanitary sewers, water and fire protection facilities, street lighting, and permanent subdivision monuments as set forth herein.

A subdivider shall improve, or agree to improve, all land dedicated or to be dedicated for streets, public ways and easements as a condition precedent to acceptance thereof and approval of the final map or parcel map.

The construction of improvements for undeveloped parcels created by a parcel map shall not be required until a permit is issued for development of the parcel involved. Improvements required for parcels which are developed shall be constructed prior to filing of the parcel map.

All improvements shall be installed to lines and grades approved by the city engineer.

Any request for variation from these standards shall be made in writing to the city manager. Following an investigation of the request by staff, the proposed variation may be approved at the discretion of the planning commission. [Res. 11-79 § I, 7-24-79].

If a parcel map or final map is approved and recorded, the development rights shall be vested for the following periods of time:

(1) An initial time period of 24 months from the date of recordation of the parcel map or final map. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, the initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.

(2) The initial 24 months shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if processing exceeds 30 days from the date the application is accepted for processing as complete.

(3) The developer/subdivider may apply for a 12-month extension of time before the initial 24 months expire. Application for an extension shall be submitted to the city manager, and/or designee, and shall be accompanied by the required fee. The request for such extension shall be referred to the planning commission for review and recommendation to the city council. The city council shall approve or disapprove any request for extension.

(4) If the developer/subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the vested rights shall continue until the expiration of the building permit, or any extension of that permit. [Ord. 674-07 § 1(D-4-A), 1-9-07].

17.55.130 Tentative map – Consideration by planning commission.
The planning commission shall consider each tentative map and accompanying statements and documents and the city manager’s report and related department and agency reports to determine whether the map is in conformity with the provisions of law and this chapter, with adopted general plan and specific plan standards and proposals, and with good planning and engineering practice.

(1) The planning commission shall consider also such measures as will promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, and other assets and conditions making for excellence of residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and other developments.

Storm drain conduits shall be constructed of Class 3 reinforced concrete pipe which conforms to the requirements of ASTM Designation C-76.

(5) Design quantities of stormwater flow shall be computed by the subdivider’s engineer by use of the rational formula:

Q = CIA

wherein Q = the quantity of flow in cubic feet per second; C = runoff coefficient; I = intensity of rainfall in inches per hour; and A = tributary area in acres.

The determination of “C” and “I” shall be approved by the city engineer before flow computations are made.

(6) Within the development, catch basins shall be so placed along the streets that the width of flow in the gutter will not exceed two feet for a one-year average recurrence interval and the depth of flow will not exceed the top of curb for a 10-year average recurrence interval. In no case shall the spacing of catch basins exceed 500 feet.

(7) Drainage conduits or channels serving a tributary area of five acres or less shall be designed for a storm of five-year average recurrence interval. Conduits or channels serving a tributary area larger than five acres shall be designed for a storm of 10-year average recurrence interval. Unless approved by the city engineer, no design energy grade line of any closed or open waterway, or any bridges, culverts, or other appurtenances thereto, excepting curb and gutter sections, shall at any point be less than two feet below ground level.

(8) Drainage easements for closed conduits shall be no less than 12 feet in width and sufficient to contain the conduit and appurtenances, plus two feet on either side thereof.

18.105.040 Procedures.
(1) Preliminary Development Plan. Once the city manager has determined that the appropriate materials have been submitted, an informational meeting(s) with the planning commission and/or city council will be held at which the project proponent is to present the conceptual plan and respond to questions and at which public input may be gathered. Notices to property owners within 300 feet, homeowner groups, and other interested parties shall be sent at least 10 days prior to said meetings.

(2) Final Development Plan. A final development plan shall be filed along with an application for a use permit. The procedures outlined in Chapter 18.135 WMC shall then apply. [Ord. 632-91 § 24.04, 10-22-91].

(1) Uses Permitted. The uses permitted in any PD district shall be determined by those uses allowed with or without use permit approval in districts with which the PD district is combined. The planning commission may approve alternative uses only if those uses can be found to be in the public interest.

The number of dwellings per parcel and the number of dwellings per building may exceed the number allowed within R-1 and R-2 districts, provided the total density of the project does not exceed that designated by the general plan.

(2) Parking Required. Off-street parking shall be provided in an amount not less than that set forth in the regulations of Chapter 18.120 WMC for the uses proposed.

(3) Building Height Limit. The height of buildings or structures shall be limited to the height requirements in each particular zone combined with the PD districts.

(4) Minimum Open Space. In all residential developments 40 percent of the gross property area shall be reserved for and devoted to outdoor open space area. In the case of unit or phase development of a total area, the same open space requirement shall be applicable to each phase. Of this required open space area, 25 percent may be restricted to private use by individual owners or users of the planned development; however, 75 percent of said 40 percent shall be common or a shared outdoor open area. Open space shall not be construed to include streets (public or private), parking areas, or area covered by structures of any kind. The planning commission may grant a modification where, after considering the general purposes of a planned development, including the open space requirements, a practicable result will obtain.

(5) Underground Utilities. In any development which is primarily designed for or occupied by dwellings, all electric and telephone facilities, fire alarm conduits, street light wiring, and other wiring conduits and similar facilities shall be placed underground by the development unless waived by the planning commission.

(6) Unit Size and Setbacks. A residential planned development may be established on parcels of land comprised of not less than three acres of contiguous land, unless the planning commission in its discretion, or the city council upon appeal, finds that the property of less than three acres is suitable, by virtue of its unique character. When a PD district abuts a residential district, the setback requirements of the adjacent residential district shall apply to that portion of the PD district along the common boundary. [Ord. 632-91 § 24.05, 10-22-91].

However, authorized maintenance shall be permitted not exceeding a total amount (during a period of five years) of 50 percent of the assessed value of the building according to the assessments thereof by the assessor of the county.

Notwithstanding the above, an owner of a nonconforming building intended for residential use may apply for a conditional use permit to allow maintenance of the building in excess of the amount specified.

(4) Destruction of Building. If at any time any building in existence or maintained at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title or amendments thereto which does not conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located shall be destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God, or act of the public enemy, to the extent of more than 50 percent of the value thereof, then and without further action by the city council, said building and the land on which said building was located or maintained shall from and after the date of such destruction be subject to all the regulations of the district in which such land and/or building is located.

Application shall be made within 30 days of the container’s owner or user being notified of the need to bring such container(s) into conformance. Such permit, if granted, shall establish a specific period of time for continued use and maintenance, based upon an individual assessment of the facts and circumstances relating to the particular container(s). Factors to be considered in approving or denying such a permit shall be the initial container’s cost, the container’s age, the value of any proposed structural alterations to the existing storage container, existing placement of the container on the subject property, its overall condition and appearance, and similar facts and circumstances. However, the intent of the city is to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the keeping of storage containers on private properties, and in no instance shall a nonconforming storage container be approved by city permit for a period of more than three years.

18.110.113 Reasonable accommodation request under the Fair Housing Acts.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a formal procedure for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures.

(2) Findings. The council of the city of Willows finds as follows:

(a) Housing that is accessible to people with disabilities has been identified as a special housing need in the housing element of the city’s current general plan.

(b) Policy RC-1.3.2 of the 2009-2014 Housing Element calls for amendment of the municipal code to provide a formal process for a person with disabilities to make a reasonable accommodation request seeking equal access to housing and reasonable accommodation in the application of the city’s zoning laws.

(c) Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodation (modifications or exceptions) in their land use regulations and practices when such accommodation may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to housing.

(d) The city of Willows has historically provided for reasonable accommodation through the use of existing regulatory procedures not specifically designed for people with disabilities.

(e) Codification of a formal process for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing to request reasonable accommodation in the application of the city’s land use regulations and establishment of relevant criteria to be used when considering such requests will ensure prompt, fair and efficient handling of such requests in accordance with the fair housing laws’ reasonable accommodation mandate.

(3) Applicability. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative or any entity, when the application of a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This section is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts.

A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made in the manner prescribed by subsection (4) of this section.

(4) Application Requirements.

(a) Application. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted on an application form provided by the planning department, or in the form of a letter, to the city manager and shall contain the following information:

(i) The applicant’s name, address and telephone number.

(ii) Address of the property for which the request is being made.

(iii) The current actual use of the property.

(iv) The basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled under the Acts.

(v) The zoning code provision, regulation or policy from which reasonable accommodation is being requested.

(vi) Why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual.

(b) Review with Other Land Use Applications. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval (including but not limited to conditional use permit, design review, general plan amendment, zone change, annexation, etc.), then the applicant shall file the information required by subsection (4)(a) of this section together for concurrent review with the application for discretionary approval.

(5) Review Authority.

(a) The City Manager. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the city manager or his/her designee if no approval is sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation.

(b) Other Review Authority. Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the authority reviewing the discretionary land use application.

(6) Review Procedure.

(a) City Manager Review. The city manager, or his/her designee, shall make a written determination within 45 days and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with subsection (7) of this section (Findings and Decision).

(b) Other Reviewing Authority. The written determination on whether to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made by the authority responsible for reviewing the discretionary land use application in compliance with the applicable review procedure for the discretionary review. The written determination to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made in accordance with subsection (7) of this section (Findings and Decision).

(7) Findings and Decision.

(a) Findings. The written decision to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on consideration of the following factors:

(i) Whether the housing which is the subject of the request will be used by an individual disabled under the Acts.

(ii) Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts.

(iii) Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city.

(iv) Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to land use and zoning.

(v) Potential impact on surrounding uses.

(vi) Physical attributes of the property and structures.

(vii) Alternative reasonable accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of benefit.

(b) Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required by subsection (7)(a) of this section.

(8) Appeal of Determination. A determination by the reviewing authority to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation may be appealed to the planning commission in compliance with WMC 18.130.060. [Ord. 734-17 § 1, 11-14-17; Ord. 703-11 § 1, 7-12-11].

(d) Obtain an extension of time within which the sign must be moved under the amortization provisions of subsection (2) of this section.

(2) Amortization.

(a) An owner of a nonconforming sign may delay removal or modification of the sign for a reasonable period in order to recover the original costs where, at the time specified for removal, the costs were not yet fully amortized. The amortization period shall be proportionate with the investment involved.

(b) The owner of a nonconforming sign may apply to the city manager for an extension of time within which the sign must be removed. The application shall contain the following information:

(i) Name and address of the sign;

(ii) A description of the sign;

(iii) The date the sign was erected;

(iv) Whether and when a sign permit was issued;

(v) The cost of construction;

(vi) The remaining term of the sign owner’s lease of the real property, if applicable; and

(vii) The present value of the sign.

(c) The city manager shall consider the information presented on the application in acting on the request for extension. If the city manager finds that the circumstances warrant granting an extension of time for amortization of the sign, the city manager may grant the extension for a reasonable time not to exceed three years. No extension shall be granted for a portable sign or sign painted on a building or structure.

(3) Alterations/Removal. At such time as a nonconforming sign is altered in any way or moved, it must be brought into conformance with the provisions of this title. The term “altered” as used herein shall include, but not be limited to, any change in the structure or sign face, including changing names or colors, deleting or adding words or symbols, or changing the appearance in any way, but shall not include normal maintenance or upkeep. If a nonconforming sign is removed for any length of time for any reason other than maintenance, it shall not be reinstalled at the subject site unless it is in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

(4) Signs with Modifications. Signs which received sign modifications prior to the adoption of this chapter, but which are nonconforming as to the provisions of this chapter, may continue in use under the provisions of that sign modification until any changes, expansions, or alterations other than normal maintenance and upkeep are proposed for the sign, or until such time as the sign modification expires. At the time of such expiration or change, the modification shall become null and void and such sign shall be brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter or removed.

(5) Use Permit or Planned Development Permit. Nonconforming signs that were permitted and installed pursuant to a conditional use permit or planned development permit, prior to the adoption of this chapter, may continue in use until changes, expansions, or alterations other than normal maintenance and upkeep are proposed for or made to such sign. At the time of such change, any such sign must be brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter.

(6) Alterations to Existing Development. When structural alterations, additions or remodeling with a value, as determined by the building official, of 25 percent or more of the full value of the improvements as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, or $15,000, whichever is greater, are made to the exterior of a building or to a site containing a nonconforming sign, any and all such nonconforming signs must be brought into conformance with the provisions of this chapter whether or not changes or alterations are proposed for or made to the sign, or such signs must be removed. Any owner or user of such nonconforming signs wishing to maintain such a sign in its existing condition may apply to the city manager for a permit to allow continued maintenance and use of the sign. Application shall be made within 30 days of the sign owner or user being notified of the need to bring such sign into conformance. Such permit, if granted, shall establish a specific period of time for continued use and maintenance, based upon an individual assessment of the facts and circumstances relating to the particular sign. Factors to be considered in approving or denying such a permit shall be the initial sign cost, the sign age, the value of the structural alterations to the existing development, and similar facts and circumstances. Failure to apply for a permit within the 30 days specified herein shall constitute a waiver of the right to request any longer period for maintenance or use of an existing nonconforming sign.

(7) Annexation – Change of Zone.

The city council of the city of Willows hereby finds and declares as follows:

(1) The city of Willows finds that continued development in the city has or will result in an increased use of certain public facilities with the result that certain facilities are now overburdened and extended beyond their capacity, or will become so if development continues. As a result of development, there is a need to expand the capacities of certain public facilities. The fees required by this chapter are found and declared to be necessary for the substantial preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare by causing new development to pay the cost of the construction of the public facilities required to mitigate their development impact demands.

(2) In accordance with Mitigation Fee Act contained in Government Code Section 66000 et seq., a report has been prepared by Pacific Municipal Consultants dated December 2008, entitled “Development Impact Mitigation Fee Feasibility/Nexus Study” that provides the necessary documentation to adopt public facilities fees. The city of Willows by this reference hereby adopts this report and its findings in its entirety, as if fully set forth within the body of this chapter.

(3) The fees established by this chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the city of Willows. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.020 Purpose.
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the city of Willows’ public facility standards contained in various infrastructure reports and plans and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city of Willows on such facilities as library, parks and recreation, freeway interchanges, traffic, police, fire, wastewater and storm drainage, the city council has determined that a public facilities development impact fee is needed in order to finance these public facility improvements and to pay for the development’s equitable share of the construction costs of these improvements. In establishing the fee described in the following sections, the city council has found the fee to be consistent with its general plan and, pursuant to Government Code Section 65913.2, has considered the effects of the fee with respect to the city’s housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.030 Benefit area.
A public facilities development impact fee for library, parks and recreation, freeway interchanges, traffic, police, fire, wastewater and storm drainage is hereby established on issuance of all building permits, subdivision maps, land divisions, etc., for development in the city of Willows to pay for necessary public facility improvements. The city council shall, in a council resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fee, describe the benefit and impact area on which the development fee is imposed, list the specific public improvements to be financed, describe the estimated cost of these facilities, describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types of new developments and set forth time for payment. As described in the fee resolution, this public facilities development fee shall be paid by each developer either prior to issuance of a building permit or at such time as deemed appropriate by the city.

At least annually, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of developments and whether the described public facilities are still needed. In addition, the public facilities development impact fee will be updated annually to reflect changes in the Engineering News Record (ENR) Index, changes in land use information or as more refined public facility master plans are prepared and approved. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.040 Limited use of fees.
The revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate and special account for each category of impact fee and such revenues, along with any interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to:

(1) Pay for the city’s future construction of facilities described in the resolution enacted pursuant to WMC 19.05.030, or to reimburse the city for those described or listed facilities constructed by the city with funds advanced by the city from other sources; or

(2) Reimburse developers who have been required or permitted by WMC 19.05.050 to install such listed facilities which are oversized with supplemental size, length, or capacity. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.050 Developer construction of facilities.
Whenever a developer is required as a condition of approval of a development permit, or agrees, to construct a public facility (or facilities) described in the resolution adopted pursuant to WMC 19.05.030, which facility is determined by the city to have supplemental size, length or capacity over that needed for the impacts of that development, and when such construction is necessary to ensure efficient and timely construction of the facilities network, a reimbursement agreement with the developer and/or a credit against the development impact fees which would otherwise be charged pursuant to the ordinance on the development project, shall be considered. The city manager is hereby authorized to make determinations of fact concerning credits under this section on behalf of the city of Willows, and thereafter to authorize the credit of such fees. Decisions of the city manager under this section may be appealed in writing to the city council if filed with the city clerk within 10 days of receipt of the decision of the city manager. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.060 Payment of fees.
All development impact fees shall be paid for at the time of application for a building permit by the city. Payment shall be in the total amount as computed by the city. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.070 Fee adjustments.
A developer of any project subject to the fee described in WMC 19.05.020 may apply to the city manager, or his designee, for a reduction or adjustment to that fee, or a waiver of that fee, based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of that development and either the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the city manager no later than: (1) 10 days prior to the public hearing on the development permit application for the project; or (2) if no development permit is required, at the time of the filing of the request for a building permit. The application shall state in detail the factual basis for the claim of waiver, reduction, or adjustment. The city manager, or his designee, shall consider the application within 30 days after the filing of the fee adjustment application and make a written determination. The decision of the city manager, or his designee, can be appealed to the city council and must be completed in the standard city appeal process as specified by the city municipal code. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.080 Change in use.
If a reduction, adjustment, or waiver is granted pursuant to WMC 19.05.070, any change in use within the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee and the portion waived, adjusted or reduced shall be due and payable to the city immediately upon notification. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.090 Severability.
The city council declares that each section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause and phrase of the ordinance codified in this chapter (singularly and collectively referred as “provision” and “provisions,” respectively) is severable and independent of every other provision of the ordinance codified in this chapter. If any provision of the ordinance codified in this chapter is held to be invalid, the city council declares that it would have adopted the remaining provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter irrespective of the provision or provisions held invalid, and further declares its express intent that the remaining provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter should remain in effect after the invalid provision has been eliminated. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].

19.05.100 Effective date.
The ordinance codified in this chapter was adopted at a noticed public hearing at which time the city council also considered the development impact fees resolution, which resolution and associated studies were available to the general public for a period of at least 14 days prior to the public hearing. This fee shall apply to the issuance of any building permit, for any development issued 60 days following the ordinance’s passage and for all other types of development issued 30 days following its passage. The ordinance shall be published once within 15 days of its adoption in a newspaper of general circulation within the city of Willows. [Ord. 684-09 § 2, 7-28-09].
