§ 10.01  TITLE OF CODE.



   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as
revised, codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the
"Huntingburg Municipal Code," for which designation "code of ordinances,"
"codified ordinances" or "code" may be substituted.  Code title, chapter and
section headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the
code.



§ 10.02  INTERPRETATION.



   Unless otherwise provided herein or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state
law.



§ 10.03  APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.



   All provisions of Title I, compatible with future legislation, shall
apply to ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code
unless otherwise specifically provided.



§ 10.04  CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.



   (A)   This code is a codification of previously existing laws,
amendments thereto, and newly enacted laws.  Any previously existing law or
amendment thereto reenacted by this code shall continue in operation and
effect, as if it had not been repealed by this code.  All rules and
regulations adopted under laws reenacted in this code shall remain in full
force and effect unless repealed or amended subsequent to the enactment of
this code.



   (B)   Any appropriation repealed and reenacted by this code is
continued only for the period designated in the original enactment of that
appropriation.



   (C)   The numerical order and position of sections in this code does
not resolve a conflict between two or more sections.



   (D)   Any irreconcilable conflict between sections shall be resolved
by reference to the dates that the sections were originally enacted.  The
section most recently enacted supersedes any conflicting section or
subsection.



   (E)   All references within a section of this code to any section of
previously existing laws refer to the numbers in the original enactment.



   (F)   (1)   The numerical designations and descriptive headings
assigned to the various titles, chapters, subchapters or sections of this
code, as originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may
be altered by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any
official publication, to more clearly indicate its content.  These
descriptive headings are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect
the meaning, application or construction of the law they precede.



      (2)   Each note following a section of this code is for
reference purposes only, and is not a part of the section.



   (G)   All references to any section of this code refer to all
subsequent amendments to that section unless otherwise provided.



(I.C. 1-1-1-5)



§ 10.05  RULES OF INTERPRETATION; DEFINITIONS.

and appropriate meaning in law shall be understood according to  their
technical import.



      (2)   Words imputing joint authority to three or more persons
shall be construed as imputing authority to a majority of such persons,
unless otherwise declared in the section giving the authority.



      (3)   Where a section requires an act to be done which, by
law, an agent or deputy may perform in addition to the principal, the

operation of division (B) with respect to that act.

the Council refers to any board, bureau, commission, division, department,
officer, agency, authority or instrumentality of any government, and that
name designation is incorrectly stated; or at the time of the effective date
of that ordinance or subsequent thereto, the rights, powers, duties or
liabilities placed with that entity are or were transferred to a different
entity; then such named board, bureau, commission, department, division,
officer, agency, authority or instrumentality, whether correctly named in the
ordinance at its effective date or not, means that correctly named entity, or
the entity to which the duties, liabilities, powers and rights were
transferred.

words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning
can be attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and
the word or words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though
the correct words were contained in the text as originally published.  No
alteration shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the
nature or extent of the error.



§ 10.10  REASONABLE TIME.



   (A)   In all cases where an ordinance requires an act to be done in
a reasonable time or requires reasonable notice to be given, reasonable time
or notice shall be deemed to mean the time which is necessary for a prompt
performance of the act or the giving of the notice.

§ 10.11  REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CODE SECTION.



   When a section of this code is repealed which repealed a former section
or law adopted prior to the enactment of this code, the former section or law
is not revived unless it so expressly provides.  The repeal of any section
shall not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred
under the section unless the repealing section so expressly provides.  The
section shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purposes of
sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such
penalty, forfeiture or liability.



(I.C. 1-1-5-1)

contained in any law, whether applicable to civil causes or proceedings, or

forfeitures, contained in a law repealed and reenacted by this code shall not
be affected by the repeal and reenactment; but all suits, proceedings and
prosecutions for causes arising or acts committed prior to the effective date
of this code may be commenced and prosecuted with the same effect as if this
code had not been enacted.

new chapter or section shall indicate, with reference to the arrangement of
this code, the proper number of the chapter or section.  In addition to the
indication thereof as may appear in the text of the proposed ordinance, a
caption or title shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance.

   (A)   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the
effective date of this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as

§ 35.08  PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER; SPECIAL POWERS AND DUTIES.



   (A)   In the event of actual or threatened disaster affecting the
city, the principal executive officer of the city may declare a local
disaster emergency, pursuant to I.C. 10-4-1-23(a), for any period not to
exceed seven days.  The declaration shall be in writing and indicate the
nature of the disaster and the conditions which have brought it about, and
the area or areas threatened and to which the state of emergency applies,
which may include the entire city or only designated parts thereof.  The
declaration shall be filed in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer of the city
and shall be announced or disseminated to the general public by the best
means available.  However, the declaration is not invalid nor ineffective if
any of the filing and dissemination requirements cannot be complied with due
to the prevailing adverse circumstances.  A declaration is not necessary if
the Governor or County Commissioners, pursuant to I.C. 10-4-1, has already

the county.

city is declared either by the Governor, County Commissioners or principal
executive officer of the city, the principal executive officer of the city
shall convene a meeting of the Common Council to perform their legislative
and administrative functions, as the situation may demand.  If the principal
executive officer of the city fails or is unable to perform the above duty,
the meeting shall be convened by a member of the Common Council.  Any
meeting of the Council shall automatically be deemed an emergency meeting
subject only to the procedural provisions of law as govern emergency meetings
of common councils, including relaxation of any applicable notice
requirements, pursuant to I.C. 5-14-1.5-5(d), and may be held in any
convenient and available place.  The meeting shall continue without
adjournment for the duration of the disaster emergency, but may be recessed
for reasonable periods of time as necessary and permitted by the
circumstances.



(`90 Code, § 8.46.090)



   (C)   In the event that a quorum of the Common Council cannot be
assembled for purposes of the meeting required, the principal executive
officer of the city shall be considered a plenipotentiary representative of
the Council and shall have all powers and may take all actions of the full
board under § 35.09 until the assemblage of a quorum is possible.

   (A)   At the meeting convened under § 35.08(B), the Common Council

at the disposal of the Council hereunder for emergency management purposes.



      (5)   The Council may order volunteer forces to the aid of the
county, state or political subdivisions thereof as soon as practicable. 
Those volunteer forces will be under the direction of the Department of Civil
Defense and Emergency Management.



      (6)   The Council may, to the extent permitted by I.C.
10-4-1-25 and subject to its provisions, command services from and/or

necessary to control the emergency and protect and provide for the public
safety and welfare.



      (7)   The Council may order the evacuation of all or part of
the population from stricken areas of the city and prescribe routes, modes of
transportation and destinations for the evacuation.



      (8)   The Council may make provision for availability and use
of temporary emergency housing, which housing need not necessarily comply
with any minimum housing standards, building or zoning regulations and the
like, which would govern the use and location of premises for housing
purposes during normal times.



      (9)   The Council may suspend, for the duration of the state
of emergency, or for a lesser period as they determine, any provisions of or
procedures prescribed by ordinances of the city if they would be impractical
during the emergency, would interfere with the implementation and carrying
out of emergency plans or would be inimical to actions necessary to protect
the public safety and welfare; provided, however, that except in accordance
with division (A)(10) below, the Council may not suspend any provisions of
ordinances or procedures which are managed by statute.



      (10)   In the event of a state of emergency has been
proclaimed by the Governor or County Commissioners, the Council may also in
accordance with I.C. 10-4-1 waive any procedures or requirements of statute
or of city ordinances reflecting statutory requirements and mandates, and
pertaining to the appropriation and expenditure of public funds, the
incurrence of obligations, the performance of public works, the entering into
contracts, the employment of permanent or temporary workers or utilization of
volunteer workers, the rental of equipment or the purchase and distribution
of supplies, materials and facilities.



      (11)   The Council may assign special emergency duties and
functions to any city offices, departments, agencies, irrespective of their
usual duties and functions, and any unexpended and unencumbered monies
budgeted and appropriated for the operation of the offices, departments and
agencies and not otherwise dedicated by law to different and specified
purposes may, within the scope of each major budget and appropriation
category (major object classification), be utilized and expended for the
purpose of carrying out the special emergency duties and functions.



      (12)   (a)   The Council may make and promulgate emergency
regulations as may be deemed necessary to protect life and property, preserve
order, conserve critical resources or implement and carry out the provisions
of the city’s, county's or state's disaster plans, including, but not
limited to the power to order the roads closed, establish curfews, close
business or any action that they deem necessary to save lives and recover
from a declared emergency.



         (b)   This power also includes the power to supplement,
modify or suspend any general contingency regulations which may have been
incorporated as part of the city's previously adopted emergency operations
plan.  Any emergency regulations adopted under this division shall not be
effective until promulgated, which promulgation shall be by written filing in
the office of the Clerk-Treasurer of the city, as required by I.C. 10-4-1;
provided, however, that should the filing be impossible because of the
emergency situation, the regulations shall be effective and enforceable
notwithstanding.



         (c)   The regulation shall have the full force of law
and shall be enforceable by any police officer in accordance with I.C. 10-4-1.



      (13)   The Council may request the county, state or the United
States or their agencies and political subdivisions to send aid, including
financing assistance, if the situation is beyond the control of the regular
and emergency city forces and resources.



   (B)   All actions and regulations under this section may be by
executive order and need not be made or adopted hereby, but shall be
consistent with and subordinate to any actions, orders or regulations made by
the Governor or a state agency implementing state emergency operations plans.

   (B)   In the event that an emergency clearly exists or is imminent
within the city and a state of emergency has not been declared by the
Governor or County Commissioners, nor is any person having the powers of the
principal executive officer of the city present to declare an emergency,
pursuant § 35.08(A), the Director may temporarily presume the existence of a
state of emergency even though not officially declared and may, as his or her
own judgment dictates, invoke, implement and carry out the provisions of the
city's adopted comprehensive emergency management and disaster control plan
as are necessary to cope with the emergency and protect the public safety and
welfare, and shall be construed to leave all powers necessary and dispensable
to doing so to the extent not specifically limited by statute or specifically

§ 50.23  BILL PAYMENT; DATE; DELINQUENCY; DISCONNECTION.



   (A)   All bills for respective utility services shall be due and
payable on the fourteenth day after the date of mailing of the billing. 
Immediately thereafter, a notice of delinquency shall be mailed to each
delinquent customer as of the sixteenth day after the date of mailing of the
billing, notifying the customer that unless the delinquent bill, plus
penalty, is satisfied in full within 14 days, the respective services for
which the delinquency is applicable shall be disconnected, and shall not be
reconnected until the delinquent bill, plus penalty, reconnection fee as
provided under § 50.25, and meter deposit for each utility, has been paid in
full.



   (B)   Prior to the disconnection of any utility for the nonpayment
of a utility bill, the affected customer shall have 14 days within which to
dispute the correctness of the billing by presenting his or her complaint or
contention in person, by representative, in writing, or by telephone to the
Clerk-Treasurer, or his or her designee, who shall investigate the billing to
determine its correctness.  The affected customer’s utilities shall not be
disconnected if it is determined that the utility billing overstates the
amount due.  In the event the customer’s dispute is not resolved to the
satisfaction of the customer, the customer shall pay all undisputed amounts
and may request a hearing before the Utility Board regarding the disputed
amounts within three business days of notification of the decision by the
Clerk-Treasurer or his or her designee.  Such request shall be made to the
Clerk-Treasurer’s office in person, in writing, or by telephone.  The
utilities for which the customer disputes the billing shall not be
disconnected pending the hearing by the Utility Board, if requested by the
customer.  Notice of the right to dispute the correctness of the billing
shall appear on the notice of disconnection.



   (C)   In the event nonpayment of a utility bill is due to a
financial or other hardship, the customer may be eligible to avoid
disconnection of utilities by entering into a written agreement for the
payment of the delinquent amounts in installments over a period not to exceed
three months, and agreeing to pay all undisputed future bills for utility
service as they come due, provided that the customer has not breached a
similar agreement with the city within the past 12 months.  Application for
a delinquent utility account agreement must be made within 14 days after the
date of the delinquency and disconnection notice.

reconnection, be considered a new customer and shall pay over to the
respective utility for which the reconnection is applied, a cash meter
deposit in the amount herein above established, or in an amount sufficient to
equal the meter deposit herein above required in the event there exists a
credit balance in favor of the customer on account of a meter deposit which

the Utility Board determines that it is necessary to establish any new rates
and charges or to amend existing rates and charges of the municipally-owned
electric, gas or water utilities of the city in order to conform to the
standards and requirements aforementioned, it shall propose new or amended
schedule of rates and charges to the Common Council of the city for its

factor (GCA) occasioned solely by the changes in the cost of purchased gas
not embedded in the base cost of gas, to be applied to the monthly metered
volume rate for each gas customer classification.  The GCA shall be
determined monthly, to reflect changes in the estimated cost of purchased gas
for the following month, and to reconcile over- or under-collections of the
cost of purchased gas for the previous month.  The GCA shall be determined
and calculated monthly in accordance with the formula set forth by the city.



   (B)   Annually, as of May 31 of each year, the GCA shall be adjusted
to reconcile actual over- collections or under-collections of the cost of
purchased gas in variance with the base cost of gas and occasioned by the
application of the GCA during the immediately preceding 12 months.  The
reconciliation shall include determination of the actual cost of gas to be
recovered, including any prior period variance reconciliation adjustments,
and comparison of said annual purchased gas costs with actual gas cost
revenues.  Gas cost revenues shall include the actual monthly GCA revenue
plus the base cost of gas embedded in the base rates and charges.  The
annual reconciliation shall be determined and calculated in accordance with
the formula set forth by the city.

BACKFLOW AND CROSS-CONNECTIONS



§ 52.40  PURPOSE.



   (A)   To protect the public potable water supply served by the city
water utility from the possibility of contamination or pollution by
isolating, within its customers internal distribution system, such
contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or backsiphonage into the
public water system.



   (B)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross
connections, actual or potential, between its customers in-plant potable
water system, and non-potable systems.



   (C)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of
cross connection control that will effectively prevent the contamination or
pollution of all potable water systems by cross connection.



(Ord. 2009-23, passed 8-18-2009; Am. Ord. 2013-34, passed 10-24-2013)



§ 52.41  AUTHORITY.



   (A)   The implementation of this policy is authorized by the city
Utility Board and overseen by the city Water Superintendent.



   (B)   This policy does not supersede the state Plumbing Code or the
IDEM Rule 327 I.A.C. 8-10, but is supplementary to them.



(Ord. 2009-23, passed 8-18-2009; Am. Ord. 2013-34, passed 10-24-2013)



§ 52.42  RESPONSIBILITY.



   (A)   The city Water Superintendent (the “Superintendent”) shall
be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution
system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow or backsiphonage
of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in
the judgment of said Superintendent, an approved backflow device is required
at the city's water service connection to any customer's premises, the
Superintendent, or its delegated agent, shall give notice in writing to said
customer to install an approved backflow prevention device at each service
connection to his or her premises.  The customer shall install such approved
device, or devices, at his or her own expense, and failure or refusal, or
inability on the part of the customer to install said device or devices,
shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises
until such device or devices have been properly installed.



   (B)   The customer has the responsibility for protecting both the
public water supply and his or her internal potable water.  After the
Superintendent has determined the type and location of backflow protection
required, the customer shall be responsible for procuring installing,
testing, repair, and maintenance of the required assembly to protect the
public water supply.  The customer is also responsible for preventing the
contamination and pollution of his or her internal water system through a
program of fixture outlet protection.  He or she may utilize public health
officials, plumbing inspectors, or other backflow specialists to assist him
in the survey of his or her facilities and to assist in the selection of
proper fixture outlet devices and the proper installation of these devices.



(Ord. 2009-23, passed 8-18-2009; Am. Ord. 2013-34, passed 10-24-2013)



§ 52.43  POLICY.



   (A)   No water service connection to any commercial, industrial, and
certain other facilities shall be allowed by the Superintendent unless the
water supply is protected as required by the city Utility Board and this
cross connection control policy.  Service of water to any premise shall be
discontinued by the Superintendent if a backflow prevention assembly required
by this policy is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found
that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or bypassed, or if an
unprotected cross connection exists on the premises.  Service will not be
restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.



   (B)   The Board recognizes the threat to the public water system
arising from cross connections.  All threats will be classified by degree of
hazard and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention devices (RP) or double check valve assembly
(DC).



   (C)   An approved RP shall be installed on each commercial,
industrial, and certain other facilities' service lines at or near the
property line or immediately inside the building before the first branch
leads off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:



      (1)   Any facility that is being constructed or remodeled or
is undergoing a change in ownership or occupancy.



      (2)   Any existing facility required to have backflow
protection per 327 I.A.C. 8-10-4.



      (3)   Any existing facility where multiple, potential or
actual, protected or unprotected cross connections exist.



      (4)   Any existing facility where a customer's water
distribution system contains intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or is
not readily accessible and available for inspection purposes.



      (5)   Any existing facility using a booster pump.  In
addition, the booster pump shall be operated in accordance with 327 I.A.C.
8-10-3.



      (6)   Any existing facility with temporary connections for
filling tanks, tanker trucks, spraying trucks, and other containers.



   (D)   A customer may request to be exempt from the installation of
an RP device on the service line.  The customer shall submit an application
to the Board requesting approval for the installation of an alternate device
or a waiver from installing a device.  If an exemption is granted and a
change in use occurs at the facility, the exemption shall no longer be valid
and the customer shall install an RP device or reapply for an exemption. 
The following will generally be exempt from the installation of an RP on the
service line:



      (1)   Fire protection systems that do not contain hazardous
chemicals may be protected by a properly installed double check detector
check assembly.



      (2)   Land irrigation systems that are not under back-pressure
may be protected by a properly installed pressure vacuum breaker.



      (3)   Any backflow prevention device existing prior to
implementation of this policy and properly maintained shall be allowed by the
Superintendent to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as
to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in
an unreasonable risk to the public health.



(Ord. 2009-23, passed 8-18-2009; Am. Ord. 2013-34, passed 10-24-2013)

      (1)   The Water Superintendent will operate a cross connection
control program which fulfills the requirements of the city Utility Board.



      (2)   On new installations, the Superintendent will require an
RP to be installed on the service line to the facility.  The RP information
and any exemptions allowed will be tracked by the Superintendent.



      (3)   For premises existing prior to the start of the initial
Ordinance 2009-23 Cross Connection Policy, the Superintendent will inspect
facilities and inform the customer by letter of any correction to be made. 
Ordinarily, 60 days will be allowed for corrective action to occur or a
compliance schedule to be agreed upon.  The time period may be shortened
depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the device(s)
in question.



      (4)   The Superintendent shall inform the customer by letter
of any failure to comply.  The Superintendent will allow an additional 15
days for correction.  In the event the customer fails to comply with the
necessary correction by the time of the second re-inspection, the
Superintendent will inform the customer by letter that the water service to
the customer's premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five
days.  In the event that the customer informs the Superintendent of
extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time
extension may be granted by the Superintendent.



      (5)   If the Superintendent determines at any time that a
serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be
terminated immediately.



      (6)   The Superintendent shall have on file a list of private
contractors who are certified backflow device testers.  All charges for
these tests will be paid by the customer of the building or property.



   (B)   Customer.



      (1)   The customer shall be responsible for the elimination or
protection of all cross connections on their premises.



      (2)   The customer shall allow his or her property to be
inspected for possible cross connections and shall follow the provisions of
this policy.



      (3)   The customer, after having been informed by a letter
from the Water Superintendent, shall at his or her expense install, maintain,
and test or have tested any and all backflow preventers on his or her
premises.



      (4)   The customer shall correct any malfunction of the
backflow preventer which is revealed by periodic testing.



      (5)   The customer shall inform the Superintendent of any
proposed or modified cross connections and also any existing cross
connections of which the customer is aware but has not been found by the
Superintendent.



      (6)   The customer shall not install a bypass around any
backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on
the bypass.  Customers who cannot shut down operation for testing of the
device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take
place.



      (7)   The customer shall install backflow preventers in
accordance with 327 I.A.C. 8-10-7 or in a manner approved by the
Superintendent.  The customer shall install only backflow preventers
approved by 327 I.A.C. 8-10-7(b) or by the Superintendent.



      (8)   No water piping supplied by any private water supply
shall be connected to the public water supply.



      (9)   The customer shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all devices being tested, repaired, or retested in the case that device
fails to operate.



      (10)   Nothing herein shall release the customer of the
responsibility for conducting periodic surveys of water use practices on his
or her premises to determine whether there are any actual or potential
uncontrolled cross connections within the customer's water system through
which contaminants could backflow into his or her own and/or the public water
supply systems.

§ 52.45  PERIODIC TESTING.



   (A)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested in accordance with
327 I.A.C. 8-10-8 or as determined by the Superintendent.



   (B)   Annual testing shall be performed by an state certified
tester.  This testing will be done at the customer's expense, with all test
results reported to the Water Superintendent by September 1 of that year.



   (C)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will
be repaired or replaced.  When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the
repair the device will be retested to insure correct operation.  High hazard
situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow
preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately.  In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date
will be established.  Parallel installation of two devices is an effective
means of the customer insuring uninterrupted water service during testing or
repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the customer desires such
continuity.



   (D)   Backflow prevention devices may be required to be tested more
frequently than specified above, in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the Superintendent feels that, due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted.

§ 55.093  CHARGES; VOLUME, STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF INDUSTRIAL SEWAGE.



   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and
equitably adjusted to the service rendered to industrial users, the city
shall base its charges not only on volume, but also on the strength and
character of industrial sewage and wastes it is required to treat and dispose
of.  The city shall require the owner or other industrial user to determine
the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly
or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system, in such a manner and by such
a method as the city may deem practicable in light of the conditions and
attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper
charge.  The owner or other industrial user shall furnish a central sampling
point available to the city at all times.



   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
biochemical oxygen demand of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended
solids in excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, and total ammonia
nitrogen in excess of 30 milligrams per liter.  Additional charges for
treating industrial waste that is stronger than normal domestic waste shall
be made on the following basis:



      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD.  There shall be an
additional charge of $0.20 per pound of biochemical oxygen demand in excess
of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid.



      (2)   Rite surcharge based upon suspended solids.  There
shall be an additional charge of $0.20 per pound of suspended solids in
excess of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid.



      (3)   Rate surcharge based upon ammonia nitrogen (NH3N). 
There shall be an additional charge of $0.70 per pound of ammonia nitrogen
(NH3N) received in excess of 30 milligrams per liter of fluid.



      (4)   Determination of strength by samplings and analysis. 
To determine the strength of the sewage and wastes, samplings and analysis
shall be made from time to time, whenever it is deemed advisable by the
city.  After charges have been established, based upon the strength of
sewage and wastes, the owner may request reconsideration of these charges by
the city, by submitting analysis of composite samples of the sewage and
wastes subject to the charges, certified by a registered engineer or
qualified graduate chemist.  The city may then adjust the charges to the
ordinance rates required by the analysis, or may recheck the findings by
additional samplings and analysis.



      (5)   Guidelines and procedures to follow in the
determination.  The determination of suspended solids, five-day biochemical
oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) contained in the waste shall be
made in accordance with the latest copy of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes, as written by the
American Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association, and
the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in conformance with Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants, CFR pt. 136,
published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.

§ 55.094  STUDY OF RATES AND CHARGES.



   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair
and equitable, and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the
various users or user classes, the city shall cause, on an annual basis, a
study to be made within a reasonable period of time following the normal
accounting period.  The study shall include, but not be limited to, an
analysis of the costs associated with the treatment of excessive strength
effluents from industrial users, volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the
financial position of the sewage works and the adequacy of its revenue to
provide reasonable funds for operation and maintenance, replacement, debt
service requirements and capital improvements to the waste treatment
system.  The studies shall be conducted by officers and/or employees of the
city, or by a firm of certified public accountants, and/or by a firm of
consulting engineers with experience in such studies.

estate, or building connecting to the sewage works shall, prior to being
permitted to make a connection, pay a connection charge in the amount of $850
per each equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) served by the connection.  The
connection fee for industrial and commercial users shall be determined on the
basis of the EDUs served by the connection, as based on the area ratio of the
water service meter serving the industrial or commercial user.  An
equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) shall be based upon a three-quarter-inch water

sewer, sewer interceptor or sewer main hereafter constructed by the city. 
The amount of the sewer availability charge shall be determined from time to
time by the Board of Public Works and Safety, and shall be based on the pro
rata cost (per each equivalent dwelling unit) of constructing the local
sewer, sewer interceptor, or sewer main sufficient to serve the lot, parcel
of real estate, or building.  The owner of any lot, parcel of real estate,
or building connecting to the sewage works shall, prior to being permitted to
make a connection, pay the applicable sewer availability charge.

real property for the construction of sewer main extensions within the
municipality, or within four miles outside of its corporate boundaries, in
order to provide service to an area pursuant to the provisions of I.C.
36-9-22 et seq.  In such event, the Board of Public Works and Safety may
establish and collect from any owner of real property who did not contribute
to the original cost of the sanitary sewer main extension, and who
subsequently taps onto, uses or deposits sewage into the sewage main
extension or any lateral sewers connected thereto, a sewer availability
charge, based upon a fair pro rata share of the cost of the construction of
the sewer main extension.



   (C)   Installment payments.  The Board of Public Works and Safety
may establish and place into effect, from time to time, as a matter of
policy, a method of payment and collection of the connection charges and
availability charges on an installment basis, with or without interest,
subject to the penalties and remedies for nonpayment and collection when due,
all as provided by this chapter or by law.

responsible for the installation of properly functioning smoke detectors.



   (G)   Any person, firm, corporation or other entity violating the

FINAL PLATS AND SECONDARY APPROVAL



§ 153.050  SECONDARY APPROVAL.



   After primary approval of the plat by the Plan Commission, the
petitioner shall proceed to install the improvements required by the primary
approval.  When the required improvements have been installed and otherwise
completed, inspected and accepted by the appropriate agencies, and all terms
and conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied, the plat or an
approved phase thereof may be granted secondary approval.  No notice or
hearing is required for secondary approval, although secondary approval must
be made by the Plan Commission at a public meeting.  A plat may not be filed
with the Dubois County Auditor and may not be recorded by the Dubois County
Recorder unless granted secondary approval by the Plan Commission.



(Ord. 99-16, passed 6-3-1999)



§ 153.051  RECORDING OF APPROVED PLAT.



   (A)   Within 60 days after the secondary approval of a plat or a
phase thereof, the petitioner shall have a fully-signed original of the plat
recorded with the Dubois County Recorder, and shall deliver one copy of the
recorded plat to the following agencies:

(Ord. 99-16, passed 6-3-1999)



§ 153.053  PHASING OF CONSTRUCTION.



   Where it is in the interest of the petitioner to complete construction
of the improvements required by the primary approval in phases rather than at
once, the petitioner shall so state in writing to the Plan Commission, and
deliver the request together with maps and drawings showing the intended
phasing of the project.  The Plan Commission may at its option provide
secondary approval to each phase as it is built, provided that at no time
shall the phasing plan produce an unsafe condition or a utility layout that
is not in compliance with the requirements of Indiana law or this Chapter.

by the Plan Commission, as sufficient to complete the required improvements
and installations.



   (B)   Acceptable security instruments include:



      (1)   A subdivision or performance bond;



      (2)   A cash bond held in an escrow account;

      (5)   A bond secured with real estate in which the petitioner
has marketable fee simple title.



   (C)   The security instrument that is accepted shall name or run to
the city for the estimated time of completion of the improvements, and shall
include terms and conditions acceptable to the Board of Public Works and
Safety to ensure that the improvements shall be completed within the allotted
time.



   (D)   Any terms providing for reductions in the face amount of an
instrument during the course of installation of improvements shall include a
requirement that the Board of Public Works and Safety approve any and all
reductions.



(Ord. 99-16, passed 6-3-1999)



§ 153.055  DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH PRIMARY APPROVAL.

Public Works and Safety or the city's Utility Board or the Dubois County
Commissioners as appropriate that all required public infrastructure has been

§ 153.076  VARIANCE AND MODIFICATION OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN.



   (A)   Where evidence may support a petitioner's challenge to these
regulations in that extraordinary hardship or practical difficulty may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, and/or that the purpose of
these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative
proposal, the proposed plan shall be referred to the Plan Commission and the
Plan Commission may grant variance to these development regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided,
that such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of these regulations; and provided further that the Plan Commission
shall not grant a variance unless it shall make findings in writing based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that the following
criteria have been affirmatively determined:



      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to
public safety, health or welfare, or injurious to other property;



      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is
based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;



      (3)   Due to the peculiar physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out.  Financial
hardship shall not constitute grounds for a variance; and



      (4)   The variance shall comply substantially with the
provisions of the comprehensive plan.



   (B)   A petition for variance shall be submitted in writing by the
petitioner prior to the Plan Commission's hearing for approval of the
preliminary plat.  The petition shall state fully the grounds for the
application and the facts relied upon by the petitioner.  Where the variance
has an impact on design and construction of public facilities, all public
agencies as appropriate shall be given ample time to investigate the petition
and comment in writing to the Plan Commission.  In approving variances, the
Plan Commission may require such conditions as will in its judgment
substantially secure the objectives of these regulations.

was made at a public hearing and that decision is under appeal, a public
hearing shall again be required in order to hear the appeal of that decision,
and the petitioner for the appeal shall pay for the hearing in the manner
prescribed under §§ 154.385 through 154.394.

subdivision control ordinance, yard setbacks and dwelling dimensions shall be
adjusted as follows:
  (a)    The front setback shall be no more than five feet greater or less
than the average front yard setback for all other dwellings in the same block
on the same street, and no less than ten feet;
  (b)    All detached garages, accessory buildings, outbuilings and sheds

block the line of site for travel on a public street, and does not as a
structure extend into the public street right-of-way.




Note J: Reciprocal Setbacks: New agricultural buildings built to house
livestock, fowl, or other farm animals shall not be built closer than 300
feet to an adjoining lot containing an existing residential structure.  New
residential structures shall not be built closer than 300 feet to an existing
lot that contains an existing building for the housing of livestock, fowl or
other farm animals.  This restriction shall not, however, apply to render an
existing lot of record unbuildable.

FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT



§ 154.305  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND
OBJECTIVES.



   (A)   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C.
36-7-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within
their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of
Huntingburg, Indiana does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.



   (B)   Findings of fact.



      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.



      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect
of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.



   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this subchapter to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:



      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.



      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction.



      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters.



      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other
development which may increase erosion or flood damage.



      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.



      (6)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures
and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.



   (D)   Objectives. The objectives of this subchapter are:



      (1)   To protect human life and health.



      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects.



      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public.



      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.



      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities
such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets,
and bridges located in floodplains.



      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to
minimize flood blight areas.



(Ord. 2014-26, passed 10-9-2014)



§ 154.306  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   A ZONE. Portions of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) in which the
principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a
combination of both. In A Zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but
waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are
labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone
A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below:



      ZONE A. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.



      ZONE AE AND A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the
one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base
flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised
maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)



      ZONE AO. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.



      ZONE AH. Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.



      ZONE AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection.



      ZONE A99. Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an
under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of
special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction
of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it
complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the
flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward
completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). A structure with a floor
area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of
the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal
initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to
have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are
detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole bams, and hay sheds.



   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE). Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition,
which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter
load-bearing walls, is new construction.



   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this subchapter.



   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.



   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.



   BASEMENT. That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.



   BOUNDARY RIVER. The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary
between Kentucky and Indiana.



   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY. The floodway of a boundary river.



   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.



   COMMUNITY. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.



   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.



   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.



   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including but not limited to:



      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a
structure or any addition to a structure:



      (2)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a
site for a manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days;



      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences,
construction of roads, or similar projects;



      (4)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees,
dikes, dams, channel improvements, and the like;



      (5)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or
drilling operations;



      (6)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or
culverts;



      (7)   Storage of materials; or



      (8)   Any other activity that might change the direction,
height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.



DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing
structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or
gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve
filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures.



   ELEVATED STRUCTURE. A non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),

park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.



   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).



   FEMA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency.



   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and
rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.



   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM). An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory
floodway.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.



   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official hydraulic and hydrologic
report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the
FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.



   FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)



   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The elevation of the regulatory flood
plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)



   FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland,
lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the
regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe
districts.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving
and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including
but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works,
floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. This subchapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.



   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOOD PROOFING). A method of protecting a structure
that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with
walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated
debris impact forces.



   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form used to certify compliance for
non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or
above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional
engineer or architect.



   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to
efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood
of any river or stream.



   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.



   FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.



   HARDSHIP (as related to variances of this subchapter). The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance.
The Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All
of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.



   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.



   HISTORIC STRUCTURES. Any structures individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites
and Structures.



   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required
to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local
flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal
and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after
June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.



   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD). A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the
new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the
six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain

the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to
doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a structure has
more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls:



         (b)   The total net area of all openings shall be at
least one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; the bottom
of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior

REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the term BASE FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL CHANCE
FLOOD, and 100-YEAR FLOOD.



   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.



   SECTION 1316. That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,
as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be
provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a
duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public
body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances
that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or
occupancy in flood-prone areas.



   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Those lands within the jurisdiction
of the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the
city are generally identified as such on the Dubois County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated October 16, 2014 as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown
on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1-A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).



   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a
slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the
main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.



   STRUCTURE. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed
by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.

whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50%
of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or
any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.



   SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating community from the NFIP
because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.



   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this subchapter,
which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
subchapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.



   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this subchapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this subchapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.



   WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.



   X ZONE. The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.



   ZONE. A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.



   ZONE A. See definition for A ZONE.



   ZONE B, C, AND X. Areas identified in the community as areas of
moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated
rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is
available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and
C.)

§ 154.307  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Lands to which this subchapter applies. This subchapter shall
apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the
city.



   (B)   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This
subchapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available
regulatory flood data is listed below.



      (1)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe
limits for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city shall be as
delineated on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance
Study of Dubois County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding
Flood Insurance Rate Map dated October 16, 2014 as well as any future
updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date.



      (2)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe
limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city, delineated
as an "A Zone" on the Dubois County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated October 16, 2014 as well as any future updates,
amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
with the most recent date, shall be according to the best data available as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the
upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to
replace existing data with better data that meets current engineering
standards. To be considered, this data must be submitted to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources for review and subsequently approved.



      (3)   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.



      (4)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD),
any more restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall
be utilized for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing
all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.



   (C)   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of
this subchapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in
areas of special flood hazard.



   (D)   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance
with the terms of this subchapter and other applicable regulations. No land
or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance
with the terms of this subchapter and other applicable regulations.



   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This subchapter is not
intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this subchapter and another conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.



   (F)   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground
elevations.



      (1)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.



      (2)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the
base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.



      (3)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question
is above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that
site shall he considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will
not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.



   (G)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
subchapter all provisions shall be:



      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements.



      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.



      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under state statutes.



   (H)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood
protection required by this subchapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur
on rare occasions. Therefore, this subchapter does not create any liability
on the part of the city, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the
State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
subchapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.



   (I)   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain
development permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of
a floodplain development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed
to be a violation of this subchapter. All violations shall be considered a
common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of
the Zoning Code for the city. All violations shall be punishable by a fine
not exceeding $100.



      (1)   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day
the violation continues to exist.



      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.



      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.



(Ord. 2014-26, passed 10-9-2014)

following requirements:



         (a)   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes
to be placed on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a
new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial
damage" as a result of a flood:



            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG
and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.



            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished
living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required
for elevated structures in § 154.309(B)(4).



            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not
attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required
to have openings.

to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
that has not been substantially damaged by a flood;



            1.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so
that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36
inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement.



            2.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished
living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required

            3.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not
attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required
to have openings.



         (c)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall
either:



            1.   Be on site for less than 180 days;



            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use

five acres.



   (D)   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA
if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed
within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at
the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that
toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters.
Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible.



   (E)   Standards for identified floodways.



      (1)   Located within SFHAs, established in § 154.307(B), are
areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified
floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any
excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving and the like undertaken before the actual start of
construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial
additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary
river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial
addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without
obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is
required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)



      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued
by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or
letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain
development permit, provided the provisions contained in § 154.309 of this
subchapter have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.



      (3)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or
in combination with existing or future development, that will adversely
affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway.
This adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the
regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as
determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project
condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with
hydraulic analyses.



      (4)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.



   (F)   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in § 154.309
of this subchapter have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.



   (G)   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation
and/or floodways/fringes.



      (1)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one
square mile:



         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where
the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the
drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.



         (b)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain
Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway (including
letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
citing the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood
protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.



         (c)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the
proper permit For construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the
proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided
the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive
than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
and the provisions contained in § 154.309 of this subchapter have been met.



      (2)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one
square mile:



         (a)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where
the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the
drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an
engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and 1% annual
chance flood elevation for the site.



         (b)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may
issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions
contained in § 154.309 of this subchapter have been met.



      (3)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.



   (H)   Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known
flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map
is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per § 154.309.

which utilizes a wireless transmitting and/or receiving antenna for
commercial purposes, with or without a support structure, that does not
exceed the height limit in the zoning district in which the facility is
located by more than 15 feet at the highest point including any attachments
thereto, carries the certification of a qualified and licensed professional
engineer that the design of the antenna and supporting structure conform with
the latest structural standards and wind loading requirements of the Uniform
Building Code and the Electronic Industry Association, and also complies with
one of the following:



      (1)   The antenna is on a monopole structure that is an
accessory use which is physically co-located on the same lot with a
principal-use facility that is manned for all broadcasting or receiving
operations, including but not limited to a radio or television broadcast
studio, or telecommunications facility, and the antenna and support structure
are set back from property lines as required in this Chapter; or



      (2)   The antenna is on a monopole support structure that is
attached to an existing pole or tower of an electric service or
telecommunications service provider, or to the water tower of a public water
distribution service provider; or

petitioner's existing and proposed facilities, including buildings, antenna
and support structures, within the jurisdiction of the city;



         (b)   A statement that the planned facilities shall be
sufficient to fully serve the jurisdiction; and



         (c)   Potential alternate locations for each facility
shown on the inventory and comprehensive plan.



      (3)   Certification from a qualified and licensed professional
engineer that the design of the antenna and supporting structure conform with
the latest structural standards and wind loading requirements of the Uniform
Building Code and the Electronic Industry Association, which certification
shall also account for all future additional users of the antenna support
structure.



      (4)   Certification that the proposed wireless transmission
facilities comply with the most recent federal and state environmental,
health and safety standards for exposure to radio frequency emissions.

the district in which the lot is located.



      (7)   (a)   The facility shall have a setback from property
lines that complies with the yard and setback requirements in this Chapter
for the zoning district in which the facility is located, plus an additional
setback from a residential or mobile home park zoning district, or from a
street centerline, that is equal to:



            (1)   Two-hundred and fifty feet; and



            (2)    Where a support structure, antenna, and
attachments thereto are in excess of 250 feet in height, an additional amount
equal to the excess height.



         (b)   Setbacks for guyed structures shall be measured
from the guy wire anchorages. All other structures shall be measured from
that part of the structure, including attachments, that is closest to the
property line.



      (8)   The structure, antenna or tower shall blend into the
surrounding environment by the use of neutral color such as metallic gray,
silver, or green.



      (9)   The owner of the facility shall dismantle all structures
and remove all communications equipment thereby restoring the site if the
facility use is deemed abandoned by the Zoning Administrator for more than
six months.



      (10)   Communication towers shall be built to include the
opportunity for co-location.  Co-location is encouraged on existing
towers.  Location on existing structures over 60 feet tall such as water
towers of granaries, shall require a building permit, but not a special
exception.
