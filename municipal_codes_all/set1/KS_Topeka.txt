(e) The arrangement and classification of the several titles, chapters, articles, and sections of the code adopted by subsection (a) of this section, and any head notes or footnotes or other references found in a section, are made for the purpose of convenience and orderly arrangement, and do not constitute a part of the ordinances, and, therefore, no implication or presumption of legislative intent or construction is to be drawn therefrom.

(f) Neither the adoption of this code nor the repeal or amendment of any prior ordinance in whole or in part shall affect any prosecution for violation of any ordinance committed prior to the effective date of this code; nor be construed as a waiver of any right, duty, contractual or other obligation under law, license, fee, fine or penalty at the effective date of this code; nor be construed as affecting any of the provisions of any ordinance relating to the collection of any legal or contractual obligation under law, license, fee, fine or penalty, or to the enforcement of any penalty; nor to affect the validity of any bond or cash deposit required to be posted, filed, or deposited pursuant to any ordinance prior to the effective date of this code.

The corporate seal of the city, as now in use and as hereafter to be used until altered, is and shall be described as follows: Two concentric circles, the larger or outer of which has the appearance of twisted rope or cord and the smaller or inner of which is a series of touching dots, and between which circles at the top are the words “Seal of Topeka” and at the bottom the word “Kansas,” with three stars on the left between the word “Seal” and the word “Kansas” and three stars on the right between the word “Topeka” and the word “Kansas.” Within the inner circle toward the bottom and extending from the middle star on the left to the middle star on the right are the words “Capital City.” Immediately below and parallel with the words “Capital City” is the word “Incorporated.” Beneath the word “Incorporated” and immediately above and following the curvature of the inner circle is the statement “Feb. 14, 1857.” Above the words “Capital City” and extending nearly to the top of the inner circle is a picture or relief representing the dome of the Kansas State Capitol.

2.10.020 Official crest.

The city has and does hereby determine that it is necessary and desirable to adopt an official crest for the city, such crest being described as follows:

(a) As far as the designer can establish, the overall shape of design 1 is the most appropriate as far as shape is concerned. Mainly this shape was used by distinguished families and individuals in the 14th century.

(b) On the chief (top) of the crest is inscribed “Golden City,” a term often used in history books to describe the effect when the sun poured its rays down upon the beautiful hills and valleys of the city; this coming from the sun filtering through the many autumn leaves. This term is also used to describe the color of the soil.

(c) On the dexter (right) side of the shield is a picture of the wheel encircling the bee hive. The wheel represents the railroads and the bee hive is a symbol for industry in the city.

(d) On the sinister (left) side of the shield is pictured a Kaw Indian house; the Kaw being a native inhabitant of this region. On either side of the hut is pictured an arrow and a stalk of corn representing the fact that the Kaw Indian was basically a farmer and a hunter.

(e) At the ghi (base) of the shield is pictured the Capitol, which is self-explanatory.

(f) The band that divides the shield is the setting for nine stars, representing the nine founders. These nine stars are divided by a thin strip which represents the structure of a bridge connecting North Topeka with Topeka, quite instrumental in Topeka’s growth. (Ord. 17226 § 2, 1-27-98. Code 1995 § 2-2.)

Such variance shall not permit either directly or indirectly any use, including defined types of signs, not otherwise permitted by each district’s use regulations. In no event shall the board of zoning appeals vary or otherwise grant appeals from building and setback lines shown on a recorded plat of subdivision unless done so in accordance with the findings set forth in this chapter.

2.45.110 Findings.

Before a variance may be granted, the board of zoning appeals shall find that all of the following conditions have been met:

(a) That the variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district and is not created by an action of the property owner or the applicant;

(b) That the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;

(c) That the strict application of the provisions of TMC Title 18, Division 4, of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;

(d) That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, property or general welfare; and

(e) That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of TMC Title 18, Division 4.

The secretary of the board of zoning appeals shall cause all variances which are granted by the board of zoning appeals to be filed of record with the register of deeds office, Shawnee County, Kansas. (Ord. 18288 § 12, 7-13-04; Ord. 16754 § 29, 9-13-94. Code 1995 § 48-34.10.)


2.45.120 Conditions.

The board of zoning appeals may impose such conditions on a variance as are necessary to accomplish the purposes of the zoning regulations, to prevent or minimize adverse impacts upon the public and neighborhoods, and to ensure compatibility of the site with its surroundings. These conditions may include but are not limited to limitations on size, bulk and location; standards for landscaping, buffering and screening; lighting and adequate ingress and egress; and guarantees of performance. (Ord. 18288 § 13, 7-13-04. Code 1995 § 48-34.11.)


2.45.130 Exceptions.

The board of zoning appeals shall have the power to permit the following exceptions to the district regulations set forth in TMC Title 18, Division 4, by the issuance of a permit maintaining conditions governing design, construction or operation of the exception so as to adequately safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding property:

(a) The reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or public enemy to the extent of less than 50 percent of its fair market value where the board finds some compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly. (Ord. 18288 § 14, 7-13-04. Code 1995 § 48-34.12.)


2.45.140 Variances not allowed.

In exercising its authority, the board of zoning appeals shall not grant a variance that would create any of the following effects:

(a) The effect of the variance on the specific property would adversely affect the land use pattern as outlined by any city land use plan or policy.

(b) The variance would be a material detriment to the public welfare or create injury to the use, enjoyment or value of property in the vicinity.

(c) The variance is not the minimum variance that will relieve the proven hardship.

(d) The variance would allow a use not allowed in the permitted zoning district in which the parcel is located.

(e) The variance will relieve the applicant of conditions or circumstances that are caused by the illegal subdivision of land, which subdivision of land caused the property to be unusable for any reasonable development under the existing regulations.

(f) The variance is grounded solely upon the opportunity to make the property more profitable or to reduce expense to the owner.

(g) The variance will modify one or more conditions imposed by the governing body as part of a conditional use permit or planned unit development. (Ord. 19691 § 8, 1-17-12.)


2.45.150 Recording with register of deeds.

The secretary of the board of zoning appeals shall cause all variances which are granted by the board of zoning appeals to be filed of record with the register of deeds. (Ord. 18288 § 16, 7-13-04. Code 1995 § 48-34.14.)

(6) Would proposals for supportive services, in combination with categories in subsections (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section or stand-alone, enhance access to or success in safe affordable housing for households at 80 percent or less AMI?

(7) Would the project be a strategic investment leading to the stabilization or revitalization of a neighborhood or promote a mixed-income approach to affordable housing either by project or location?

(8) Would the project, if new construction, be compatible with the design character of the neighborhood and/or advance high-quality design standards including “crime prevention through environmental design?”

(9) Have total development and project costs and courses of funds been submitted?

To the extent allowable by funding sources, multiple-year commitments may be made to address needs identified in the five-year consolidated plan or the annual consolidated action plan.

2.110.290 Appearance bonds – Methods of securing.

A person having the right to post bond for appearance shall, in order to do so, execute in writing a promise to appear at the municipal court at a stated time and place. Such appearance bond shall be in an amount as determined by the municipal judge, and may be secured by any one of the following methods, and when so secured, such person shall be released from custody.

The methods of securing the appearance of an accused person are as follows:

(a) Payment of cash, except that the municipal judge may permit negotiable securities or a personal check in lieu of cash.

(b) The execution of an appearance bond by a responsible individual residing within the state of Kansas, as surety with the approval of the municipal judge.

(c) A guaranteed arrest bond certificate issued by either a surety company authorized to transact such business within the state of Kansas, or an automobile club authorized to transact business in this state by the commissioner of insurance, except that such “guaranteed arrest bond certificate” must be signed by the person to whom it is issued and must contain a printed statement that the surety guarantees the appearance of such person and, in the event of failure of such person to appear in court at the time of trial, will pay any fine or forfeiture imposed upon such person not to exceed an amount to be stated on such certificate.

(d) In lieu of giving security in the manner provided by subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, if the arrest is for the violation of a city ordinance relating to the operation of a motor vehicle the accused person may deposit with the arresting law enforcement officer or the clerk of the municipal court a valid Kansas driver’s license in exchange for a receipt therefor issued by the law enforcement officer or the clerk of the municipal court, the form of which shall be approved by the division of vehicles of the state Department of Revenue. Such receipt shall be recognized as a valid temporary Kansas driver’s license authorizing the operation of a motor vehicle by the accused person to the date of the hearing stated on the receipt. Such driver’s license and written copy of the notice to appear shall be delivered by the law enforcement officer to the municipal court as soon as reasonably possible. If the hearing on any such charge is continued for any reason, the municipal judge may note on the receipt the date to which such hearing has been continued, and such receipt shall be recognized as a valid temporary Kansas driver’s license until such date, but in no event shall such receipt be recognized as a valid Kansas driver’s license for a period longer than 30 days from the date for the original hearing. Any person who deposited a driver’s license to secure such person’s appearance, in lieu of giving a bond as provided in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, shall have such driver’s license returned upon the giving of the required bond pursuant to subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section or upon final determination of the charge.

In the event the accused person deposits a valid Kansas driver’s license with the municipal court and fails to appear in court on the date set for appearance, or any continuance thereof, and in any event within 30 days from the date set for the original hearing, the municipal judge shall forward the driver’s license of such person to the division of vehicles with an appropriate explanation attached thereto. Upon receipt of the driver’s license of such person the division of vehicles shall suspend such person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state until such person appears before the municipal court, or the municipal court makes a final disposition thereof, and notice of such disposition is given by the municipal court to the division, or for a period not exceeding six months from the date such person’s driver’s license is received by the division, whichever is earlier.

Any person who applies for a replacement or new driver’s license prior to the return of such person’s original license, when such license has been deposited in lieu of the giving of a bond as provided in this section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as set forth in K.S.A. 8-2116, and amendments thereto.

Where the forfeiture of a bond has become final, the court shall direct the application of the funds or that suitable action be instituted for the collection from the sureties thereon or from the accused person.

Any fine so established shall be within the minimum and maximum allowable fines established by ordinance for such offenses by the governing body. The following traffic violations are specifically excluded from any schedule of fines:

(3) Driving without a valid license issued or on a canceled, suspended or revoked license;

(4) Fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer; or

(5) Offense comparable to those prescribed by K.S.A. 8-1602, 8-1603 and 8-1604 and amendments thereto.

(b) A person charged with the violation of an ordinance contained in a schedule of fines established under subsection (a) of this section shall, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, appear at the place and time specified in the notice to appear. If the person enters an appearance, waives right to trial, or pleads guilty or no contest, the fine shall be no greater than that specified in the schedule.

(c) Prior to the time specified in the notice to appear, a person charged with an ordinance cigarette or tobacco infraction or a violation of an ordinance contained in a schedule of fines established under subsection (a) of this section may enter an appearance, waive right to trial, plead guilty or no contest and pay the fine for the violation as specified in the schedule or in TMC 2.110.280(a) and amendments thereto. At the election of the person charged, such appearance, waiver, plea and payment may be made by mail or in person and payment may be by personal check. The complaint shall not have been complied with if a check is not honored for any reason, or the fine is not paid in full prior to the time specified in the notice to appear.

The municipal judge may authorize the clerk of the municipal court or some other person to accept by mail or in person such voluntary appearance, plea of guilty or no contest and payment of the fine imposed by the schedule or by TMC 2.110.280(a) and amendments thereto.

The city manager shall be authorized to secure outside counsel to defend any claim against the city workers compensation self-insurance fund.

(b) The city risk manager shall investigate or cause to be investigated each claim against the city workers compensation self-insurance fund. For the purposes of such investigations, the risk manager is authorized to obtain expert advice regarding the injuries, occupational diseases, disabilities and damages involved in such claims.

For any workers compensation settlement amounts in excess of $10,000, the city risk manager shall obtain the approval of the governing body, and any settlement made without governing body approval shall be invalid.

“Resident” shall mean a person who has established, at least 60 consecutive days prior to filing a declaration of domestic partnership with the office of the city designated by the city manager, a present and fixed residence within the city limits of Topeka, Kansas, where the person intends to remain for an indefinite period and to which the person intends to return following absence.

This prohibition does not apply if the previous domestic partnership ended because one of the partners died. (Ord. 19905 § 3, 5-20-14.)


2.150.040 Procedure and fees.

(a) The city manager shall develop procedures and standard forms for the “registration of domestic partnership” and “notice of removal from the domestic partnership registry.”

(b) The city manager, or his or her designee, shall determine a reasonable fee based upon the cost of processing the forms and the city shall charge these fees to the persons filing a declaration of domestic partnership. No fee shall be charged for filing a request for removal from the domestic partnership registry.

(b) Procedure. A domestic partnership registered with the city shall be removed from the registry in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) Within 90 days of the dissolution of the domestic partnership, at least one former partner shall file a request for removal from the domestic partner registry with an office of the city designated by the city manager pursuant to procedures adopted by the city manager. Upon receipt, the city shall provide the domestic partner who filed the request for removal from the domestic partner registry with two copies of the request marked “filed.” Unless the partners jointly file the request, the partner filing the request shall within five days send a copy of the filed request to the other partner’s last known address. This notice requirement does not apply if the removal request is due to a death of one of the domestic partners.

(2) The request shall be effective upon filing the request for removal from the domestic partner registry with the city by one or both partners or on the date of the death of one.

(3) A former domestic partner who has given a copy of the declaration of domestic partnership to any third party to qualify for any benefit or right, and whose receipt of that benefit or enjoyment of that right has not otherwise terminated, shall notify the third party in writing of the request for removal from the domestic partner registry, at the last known address of the third party.

(4) Failure to provide third party notice required in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall not delay or prevent the removal of the domestic partnership from the registry. The city shall have no duty to provide notice to third parties. (Ord. 19905 § 5, 5-20-14.)

The city manager shall develop procedures for the implementation of this section. (Ord. 19905 § 6, 5-20-14.)


2.150.070 Legal effect.

Registration pursuant to this chapter creates no legal rights, other than the right to have the registered domestic partnership included in the city’s domestic partner registry pursuant to this chapter. No parties are prohibited from extending rights or benefits to persons listed in the domestic partner registry. (Ord. 19905 § 7, 5-20-14.)


2.150.080 Other applicable laws – Kansas Open Records Act.

(a) This chapter shall not be interpreted nor construed to permit the recognition of a relationship that is otherwise prohibited by state law.

(b) The city workers compensation self-insurance fund shall be liable to pay:

(1) All workers compensation claims arising on and after February 17, 1981, and all other expenses required to be paid by the city as a self-insured employer under the workers compensation law of this state, as amended.

(2) The amount that the city is liable to pay of the carrier’s share of expense of the administration of the office of the state workers compensation director, as provided in K.S.A. 74-712 through 74-719, inclusive, for the period from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 1981, and for each fiscal year beginning January 1st thereafter.

(3) The cost of administering the city workers compensation self-insurance fund including the defense of such fund and any costs assessed to such fund in any proceeding to which it is a party, including administrative costs necessary for the operation of the city workers compensation self-insurance fund. For the purposes of workers compensation claims, all city departments and agencies are hereby deemed to be a single employer whose liability specified in this section is hereby imposed solely upon the city workers compensation self-insurance fund, and such employer is hereby declared to be a fully authorized and qualified self-insurer under K.S.A. 44-532, and any amendments thereto, and such employer shall be required to make any reports required thereafter, except that such fund shall not apply to the employment of any firefighters who are members of the firemen’s relief association and for whom a valid statement of election to exempt such members from the provisions of the Workers Compensation Act has been filed with the director of workers compensation by the city council of such firemen’s relief association as provided in K.S.A. 44-505d, and amendments thereto.

(c) The city council may act as a self-insurer under the state Workers Compensation Act (K.S.A. 44-501 et seq.). As the council has elected to act as a self-insurer, it shall by resolution create a separate fund in the budget and accounts of the city which shall be a reserve fund for the payment of workers compensation claims, judgments and expenses. Payments to such reserve fund may be made from moneys available to the city under provisions of K.S.A. 44-505c, and amendments thereto, and by the transfer of moneys from any other funds or accounts of the city in reasonable proportion to the estimated cost of providing workers compensation benefits to the employees of the city compensated from such funds. Any balance remaining in such reserve fund at the end of the fiscal year shall be carried forward into the reserve fund for succeeding fiscal years. Such fund shall not be subject to provisions of K.S.A. 79-2925 through 79-2937 inclusive, and acts amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto, except that, in making the budget of the city, the amounts credited to and the amount on hand in such reserve fund, and the amount expended therefrom, shall be included in the annual budget for the information of the residents. Interest earned on the investment of moneys in such fund shall be credited to such fund. If the city council shall determine on an actuarial basis that money which was credited to such fund, or any part thereof, is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was established, the council may transfer such amount not needed to the funds or accounts from which the money was received. Any money so transferred shall be budgeted in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 79-2925 through 79-2937 as amended and any other applicable state law provisions. This section shall be construed as supplemental to and as part of the state Workers Compensation Act.

(d) The legal department shall administer the city workers compensation self-insurance fund, and all payments from such fund shall be upon warrant checks of the city issued pursuant to vouchers approved by the director of administrative and financial services or designee.

(e) All moneys received for the city workers compensation self-insurance fund shall be remitted to the city treasurer. Upon receipt of any such remittances, the city treasurer shall deposit the entire amount thereof in the city treasury to the credit of the city workers compensation self-insurance fund.

In the manner as provided in this chapter and the rules and regulations established hereunder:

Additional newspapers or journals may be designated for such publication. Notices shall be sent to all active prospective bidders. All bids shall be sealed when received and shall be opened in public at the hour stated in the notice.

(b) All purchases or sales estimated to exceed $25,000, but not more than $50,000, shall be made after receipt of sealed bids following at least three days’ notice posted on a public bulletin board in City Hall and the city’s website. Sealed bids may also be solicited as provided in subsection (a) of this section.

(c) All purchases or sales estimated to be more than $5,000 but less than $25,000 may be made after receipt of three or more bid solicitations by telephone, telephone facsimile or sealed bid following at least three days’ notice posted in a public bulletin board in City Hall and the city’s website.

(d) All purchases or sales estimated to be less than $5,000 shall be made in accordance with written rules promulgated by the director of administration and financial services.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, sealed competitive bids shall not be required:

(1) For contractual services where no competition exists;

(2) For sales in an established market;

(3) When an emergency requires immediate delivery of supplies, materials or equipment, or immediate performance of services;

(4) When, in connection with the sale of property, it would be more advantageous to sell the property at a public auction;

(5) When a contract for supplies, services, or equipment was executed by a vendor with a state agency, municipality, or political subdivision whose procurement practices include competitive bidding; or

(6) When the director of contracts and procurement determines that negotiated procurement, pursuant to TMC 3.30.035, is appropriate for the purchase of services or products.

(f) Contracts and purchases shall in all cases be based on city specifications. When deemed applicable and feasible such specifications shall include either energy efficiency standards or appropriate life cycle cost formulas, or both. A contract or purchase may be rejected on the basis that a product is manufactured or assembled outside the United States. No such specification shall be fixed in a manner to effectively exclude any responsible bidder offering comparable supplies, materials, equipment or contractual services.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the director of the department of administrative and financial services may authorize city departments to contract for services and materials with other city departments, or with state agencies, federal agencies, or other political subdivisions of the state without competitive bids if:

(2) The obligations and duties imposed on the city department required to perform services or supply materials are within the normal scope of duties of the city department and the competence of the city department to perform the contracted services and to deliver the prescribed materials is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the purchasing officer; and

(3) Where the contract or service is financed entirely from money derived exclusively from the city general fund, the director of administrative and financial services must first determine that comparable materials or services are not reasonably available at a lower cost from responsible sources other than governmental agencies.

(h) Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no city department shall enter into any lease of real property without the prior approval of the director of the department of administrative and financial services. Such city department shall submit to the director of the department of administrative and financial services such information relating to any such proposed lease as the director may require. The director shall either approve, modify and approve or reject any such proposed lease.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, sales of retired motor vehicles, mowers, graders and other construction machinery and equipment from any department of the city shall be to the highest responsible bidder at either an advertised public auction or by sealed competitive bids or as otherwise authorized by this section. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a city department from trading in such vehicles and equipment when authorized. (Ord. 19543 § 1, 3-29-11.)

3.55.010 General objectives.

(a) The securing of private economic growth and development and the addition of new jobs within the community are important current and long-term objectives of this city. The granting of property tax exemptions is one of the tools available under state law to secure these public objectives. The benefit/costs analysis of tax exemptions is important in order to prevent the erosion of the city’s tax base and maintain the fiscal capacity to provide the public infrastructure and service necessary to promote economic development. Therefore, property tax exemptions will be linked to job creation and capital investment. For the purposes of this chapter, “job” is defined as a total of 2,080 hours annually at a qualified business facility. Employees with less than 2,080 hours annually may be combined with other employees until combined total hours equal 2,080 hours, meeting requirements for one job.

(b) The city council may exempt certain property used for economic development purposes from ad valorem taxes for a maximum of 10 years. This discretionary authority is subject to such limitations or prohibitions as may be enacted by the legislature of the state that are uniformly applicable to all cities and counties, and any requirements or conditions imposed by the council. The city may:

3.55.020 Application required.

The city will not consider the granting of any tax exemption under this chapter unless the business submits a full and complete application, and provides such additional information as may be requested by the council. The city manager or a designee is hereby authorized and empowered to prepare a standard application form which, upon completion, will provide the council with adequate and sufficient information to determine whether a tax exemption should be granted and the amounts thereof. The accuracy of the information provided in the application shall be verified by the applicant. Any misstatement of or error in fact may render the application null and void and may be cause for the repeal of any ordinance adopted in reliance on such information. No application shall be received or considered after the start of construction for improvement on which the exemption is sought; provided, however, that an applicant who misses the filing deadline may submit a written statement to the city manager requesting permission to file the application within the calendar year wherein the construction or improvement is commenced. The applicant must show excusable neglect and reliance upon the tax exemption as an incentive. Upon a finding by the city manager that there was excusable neglect and that the applicant relied upon the tax exemption as an incentive for the construction or improvement the application will be received and considered. (Ord. 18477 § 16, 7-12-05; Ord. 18365 § 1, 12-21-04; Ord. 17400 § 1, 9-7-99; Ord. 17270 § 2, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 2, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-32. Code 1995 § 138-77.)

3.55.030 Initial review procedure.

On receipt of the completed application form and the required fee, the city manager or a designee shall determine whether the application is complete and sufficient for review, and whether the applicant’s business is eligible for an exemption under the state Constitution, this chapter and any other applicable laws. If the application is incomplete, the city manager or a designee shall immediately notify the applicant, noting the need for such changes or additions as deemed necessary. If questions arise as to whether the business is legally eligible for an exemption, the matter shall be referred to the city attorney, who shall consult with the applicant. If the application is found complete, and is for a purpose which appears to be authorized by law, the city manager or a designee shall so notify the administrative review committee. (Ord. 18477 § 17, 7-12-05; Ord. 18365 § 2, 12-21-04; Ord. 17270 § 3, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 3, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-33. Code 1995 § 138-78.)

3.55.040 Administrative review committee.

There is hereby created an administrative review committee, which shall be composed of the city manager or a designee, who shall serve as chair, a representative of the affected school district, and the member of the city council whose district is affected by the request for tax exemption. The committee shall meet on call of the chair. The purpose of the administrative review committee shall be to receive and review requests and applications for tax exemptions, to gather and review such additional information as may be deemed necessary to conduct preliminary negotiations with the applicant business and to make such recommendations as deemed advisable to the council. Administrative review committee records, including applications for tax exemptions, may be withheld from public disclosure as provided for under the Open Records Act (K.S.A. 45-215 et seq.), but shall be available for public inspection when otherwise required by law. The committee is authorized to issue administrative letters of intent when requested by the applicant upon a finding that the public interest requires confidentiality in order to successfully negotiate the location of the prospective business within the city or an expansion of an existing business. Such administrative letters of intent shall not be binding on the council and shall be superseded by any final action of the council or by any letter of intent issued by the council. (Ord. 18477 § 18, 7-12-05; Ord. 18365 § 3, 12-21-04; Ord. 17270 § 4, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 4, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-34. Code 1995 § 138-79.)

3.55.050 Initial council action.

Upon receiving the recommendations of the administrative review committee, the council shall first determine whether to reject the requested exemption or to further the request.

The city clerk shall thereupon notify the board of county commissioners, the superintendent of the appropriate school district, and the clerk of any other taxing jurisdiction, excluding the state, which derives or could derive property taxes from the affected business, advising them of the scheduled public hearing and inviting their review and comment. Upon request, the city clerk shall provide any such public agency with a copy of the application. The applicant business shall be invited, but not required, to attend the public hearing.

3.55.070 Letter of intent.

Upon receiving the recommendations of the administrative review committee, the council may issue a letter of intent, setting forth in general terms its proposed plans for granting a tax exemption and any conditions thereto. Such letters of intent shall be issued only with the approval of the council, and as an expression of good faith intent, but shall not in any way bind the city to the granting of an exemption. Such letters of intent shall expire six months after issuance but may be renewed. A public hearing shall not be required prior to the issuance of letters of intent. No elected or appointed officer, employee or committee of the city, and no chamber, board, development council or other public or private body or individual, shall be authorized to speak for and commit the council to the granting of a tax exemption. Letters of intent issued by the council shall supersede any letters issued by the administrative review committee. (Ord. 17270 § 7, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 7, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-37.

3.55.080 Standards for determining benefits.

The city will consider granting tax exemptions only upon a clear and factual showing of direct economic benefit to the city through advancement of its economic development goals, including the creation of additional jobs and the stimulation of additional private investment. The city council, in determining the amount and term of exemption to be granted, shall consider various factors including, but not limited to, the following:

(a) The assessed valuation of the property in relation to the economic benefit to the city of increased employment.

(b) The gain in tax revenue which may result from the new or expanded business, including the increase in the property tax base upon the expiration of the exemption.

(c) The contribution that the new or expanded business will make towards increased employment and earnings within the community.

(d) The number of new jobs created directly by the business in relation to the amount of tax exemption granted.

(e) The kinds of jobs created in relation to the type of skills available from the local labor market.

(f) The utilization by the business of labor skills and abilities of unemployed persons in the community.

(g) The degree to which the business improves the diversification of the economy of the city and its environs.

(h) The degree to which the ultimate market products are outside the community, recognizing that outside markets bring in “new money” to the local economy.

(i) The potential of the business for future expansion and additional job creation.

(j) The beneficial impacts the business may have by creating any other new jobs and businesses, including the utilization of local products or other materials and substances in manufacturing.

(k) The beneficial economic impact the business will have on a particular area of the city, including designated enterprise zones and areas of needed revitalization or redevelopment.

(l) The compatibility of the location of the business with land use and development plans of the city and the availability of existing infrastructure facilities and essential public service.

(m) The extent to which additional direct or indirect public costs to the city and to other local units would be necessary, such as the cost of the extension of public facilities.

(n) The extent to which the economic and employment benefits of the tax exemption accrue to the residents and taxpayers of those taxing subdivisions which indirectly subsidize the business as a result of the foregone tax revenue. (Ord. 17270 § 8, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 8, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-38. Code 1995 § 138-83.)

3.55.090 Amount of tax incentive.

The two primary objectives of the city in granting tax exemptions for economic development are to provide needed jobs, and to expand the economic and tax base of the city. The city recognizes that a simple system of determining the amount of tax exemption to be granted to reach these objectives may not always be equitable if applied uniformly to different kinds of businesses. As a result, in determining the actual amount of tax exemption granted, the city shall consider the factors and criteria set forth in TMC 3.55.080. In addition, the city shall consider the following guidelines:

(a) Job Quantity Reduction. A job quantity reduction shall be determined at the rate of one percent exemption for each new full-time equivalent job created not to exceed 70 percent.

(b) Job Quality Reduction. A job quality reduction shall be determined by dividing the company’s average wage rate for the newly created jobs by the Shawnee County base wage rate.* The resulting factor shall be multiplied by 30 percent to determine the job quality payment exemption. The job quality exemption shall not exceed 30 percent.

(c) Capital Investment Reduction. A capital investment payment reduction may be calculated if the amount of the capital investment is significant, if the investment contributes to the potential for new job creation or to the retention of existing jobs, if the investment has a positive impact on a particular geographical area of the city where investment is needed, or if such capital investment adds to the general economic welfare of the city. The capital investment reduction shall be determined at the rate of one percent for each $100,000 in capital investment. The capital investment reduction shall not exceed 80 percent.

The city reserves the right to change the methodology of calculating the tax exemption. For those businesses which have applied for or received an exemption prior to May 1, 1991, the calculation shall be based upon the formula in Ordinance 15898. (Ord. 18365 § 4, 12-21-04; Ord. 17270 § 9, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 9, 7-23-91; Ord. 16349 § 9, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-39. Code 1995 § 138-84.)

*    The Shawnee County base wage rate is computed annually using the most recent County Business Patterns published by the U.S. Bureau of Census. The base wage rate is determined by averaging the hourly wage rate for all the county industries with the combined hourly wage rate for all manufacturing and wholesale trade industries.


3.55.100 Nominal tax determination.

All tangible property of a business receiving a tax exemption under this chapter shall be annually assessed by the county appraiser in the same manner as if it were not exempt, but only the amount thereof not exempted by this chapter shall be placed on the tax rolls. The amount of the property taxes which would be payable shall also be determined annually by the county clerk and treasurer, in the same manner as if the property were not exempt, but only such amounts not exempted by this chapter shall be placed on the tax rolls. Separate assessments and tax calculations shall be made for the land, for the improvements thereon, and for any tangible personal property associated therewith, of the exempt business. The appropriate county officers are requested to provide the city with this information as early as possible, but not later than November 15th of each year. (Ord. 17270 § 10, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 10, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-40. Code 1995 § 138-85.)


3.55.110 Minimum payment.

(a) Any applicant making an application and receiving an exemption pursuant to this chapter is required to pay taxes on the assessed valuation of the real estate, including either buildings together with land or land only, prior to the construction of new buildings or added improvements to buildings on such property or prior to the acquisition of the property by the business. This payment will ensure that the city, county, school district and any other taxing jurisdictions affected will not receive less tax revenue from the property than was received prior to the exemption.

(b) Additionally, each business will pay taxes equal to 20 percent of the tax otherwise due with respect to the exemption. If application of the formula as set forth herein yields a lesser payment, then the minimum payment of 20 percent will apply. For extraordinary reasons, such as when vacant buildings are acquired for a new business, when the market value of the property has decreased, or when the size of the project is exceptionally large (i.e., jobs created and/or new capital investment), this requirement may be waived in part or in whole by the council of the city of Topeka.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city council may reduce the amount of exemption under this section by the amount of one percent. The city’s pro rata share of the one percent tax savings may be used for economic development in the city of Topeka pursuant to the provisions of TMC 3.55.210. (Ord. 18365 § 5, 12-21-04; Ord. 18162 § 1, 1-13-04; Ord. 17270 § 11, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 11, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-41. Code 1995 § 138-86.)

    Cross References: City council – mayor, Chapter 2.15 TMC.


3.55.120 Annual renewal.

(a) The extent and term of any tax exemption granted shall be subject to annual review by the city council to ensure that the ownership and use of the property and any other qualifying criteria of the business for the tax exemption continue to exist. Information justifying the continued exemption will be submitted annually to the city manager or a designee for review and approval. The city manager will advise the council of all annual determinations. The city manager determinations may be reversed if the council places the matter on an agenda and so votes.

(b) Upon the failure of any business to fully and timely pay the taxes due as may be required or to provide reports or other information requested by the city and reasonably necessary for the implementation of this chapter, the city shall either revoke or not renew the authorization of such an exemption. (Ord. 18477 § 19, 7-12-05; Ord. 18365 § 6, 12-21-04; Ord. 17270 § 12, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 12, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-42. Code 1995 § 138-87.)

(Ord. 17270 § 14, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 14, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-44. Code 1995 § 138-89.)

    Cross References: City clerk, TMC 2.25.010.


3.55.150 Waiver of requirements.

The council reserves the right to grant or not to grant tax exemption under circumstances beyond the scope of this chapter or to waive any procedural requirement not mandated by state law. However, no such action or waiver shall be taken or made except upon a finding by the council that a compelling or imperative reason or emergency exists, and that such action or waiver is found and declared to be in the public interest. (Ord. 17270 § 15, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 15, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-45. Code 1995 § 138-90.)

    Cross References: City council – mayor, Chapter 2.15 TMC.


3.55.160 Transfer of ownership or use.

No tax exemption granted by the city shall be transferred as a result of a change in the majority ownership of the business. Any new owner shall file a new application for a tax exemption. Further, the city shall be notified by the business of any substantive change in the use of a tax exempt property. (Ord. 17270 § 16, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 16, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-46. Code 1995 § 138-91.)


3.55.170 Special assessments.

Any tax exemption granted for real property under this chapter shall not affect the liability of such property for any special assessments levied or to be levied against such property. (Ord. 17270 § 17, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 17, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-47. Code 1995 § 138-92.)


3.55.180 No exemptions for prior commencement or expansion.

No tax exemption shall be granted to any business which commenced operations prior to August 5, 1986, nor for the expansion of a business unless such expansion created new employment after August 5, 1986. (Ord. 17270 § 18, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 18, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-48. Code 1995 § 138-93.)


3.55.190 Jurisdiction.

The city shall grant tax exemptions only in regard to property located within the city. The city encourages the board of county commissioners to consult with the city as to applications outside the city and within the three-mile area of the city. (Ord. 17270 § 19, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 19, 7-23-91; Code 1981 § 42-49. Code 1995 § 138-94.)


3.55.200 Other policies.

The policy set forth herein with regard to property tax exemptions is considered separate and distinct from the city’s policy regarding payments in lieu of taxes and reduced payments in lieu of taxes in relation to industrial revenue bonds. In the event a property would qualify under both policies, then the property shall be eligible for only one incentive program which shall be at the election of the applicant. (Ord. 17270 § 20, 6-2-98; Ord. 16349 § 20, 7-23-91. Code 1995 § 138-95.)

Except as provided by subsection (f) of this section, the hearing shall be scheduled for not more than 14 days from the date of the notification, and the licensee shall be notified of the date, time and location of the hearing. The licensee may appear in person, or by counsel, or both. The chief of police may continue the hearing in his or her discretion.

The chief of police shall serve a copy of the order on the licensee.

The chief of police shall render an order, including a brief statement of findings of fact, conclusions of law and policy reasons for the decision if it is an exercise of the chief of police’s discretion, to justify his or her decision to take the specific action and the determination of an immediate danger. The chief of police shall give such notice as is practicable to persons who are required to comply with the order. The order is effective when rendered. After issuing an order pursuant to this section, the chief of police shall proceed as quickly as feasible to complete any proceedings pursuant to subsection (c) of this section that would be required if the matter did not justify the use of emergency proceedings.

6.15.170 Dangerous dogs.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to possess a dangerous dog or violate the provisions of this title. Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of this title shall be assessed, fined and the animal disposed of, as provided below:

(1) If the municipal court judge determines that a dog is dangerous pursuant to this chapter, the owner of the dangerous dog shall be required to comply with the following:

(i) Registration and Microchipping. The owner shall annually register the dangerous dog with the city, on such forms designated by the police chief, and shall have a microchip inserted into the dog by the humane society. The microchip shall detail the dangerous dog registration and such other information as may be appropriate to determine the ownership of the dog. The owner shall pay a $50.00 annual registration fee and shall pay all costs associated with the microchip procedure and registration of the dog. The owner shall be responsible for maintaining with the police department the address of the owner and the dangerous dog. The owner shall notify the police department within seven days of a change in address for the owner and dangerous dog.

(ii) Confinement – Muzzle/Restraint. All dangerous dogs shall be confined within a secure enclosure, which can be either a building (i.e., Morton building, shed or garage) or a dwelling/residence. It shall be unlawful for any owner to maintain a dangerous dog upon any premises that does not have a secure enclosure, unless the owner keeps the dangerous dog inside his or her dwelling/residence. It shall be unlawful for any owner to allow a dangerous dog to be outside of the dwelling/residence of the owner or outside the secured enclosure unless it is necessary for the owner (A) to obtain veterinary care for the dangerous dog; or (B) for the limited purposes of allowing said dangerous dog to urinate or defecate; or (C) to surrender the dangerous dog to the humane society to be euthanized by a certified veterinarian; or (D) to respond to such orders of law enforcement officials as may be required. In such event, the dangerous dog shall be securely and humanely muzzled and restrained with a leash not exceeding four feet in length, and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner of the dangerous dog. The muzzle shall be made and used in a manner that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration, but shall prevent it from biting any human or animal.

(iii) Sterilization. The owner shall pay for a licensed veterinarian to spay or neuter the dangerous dog before it will be released to the owner.

(iv) Transfer Prohibited. The owner shall not sell or give away the dangerous dog under any circumstances. If the owner no longer wishes to keep the dangerous dog, the dog must be surrendered to the humane society to be euthanized by a certified veterinarian.

(2) Upon conviction of keeping a dangerous dog, the owner shall comply with the provisions of this chapter within 15 days. The owner shall file proof of sterilization and microchipping, acceptable to the municipal court, with the clerk of the municipal court no later than 20 calendar days after conviction. Upon receipt, the clerk of the municipal court shall provide a copy of such proof to the legal department and the dog may then be released. If the owner fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter within the time provided, the dog shall be destroyed. If the owner or keeper of the dog contests the determination, he or she may appeal within 14 days of the finding to the district court pursuant to law.

(3) The municipal court shall impose a fine of at least $499.00 and not more than $1,000 on a person who has been convicted of possessing a dangerous dog for an attack on a human being pursuant to TMC 6.05.010(h)(3). The municipal court shall have no authority to suspend the fine or any portion of the fine.

(4) The municipal court shall impose a fine of $250.00 on a person who has been convicted of possessing a dangerous dog for an attack on a domestic animal pursuant to TMC 6.05.010(h)(3). The municipal court shall have no authority to suspend the fine or any portion of the fine.

(b) In the event that an animal control officer or law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a dog is dangerous, as defined by TMC 6.05.010, the animal control officer or law enforcement officer may seize and impound such animal at the animal shelter or humane society. If an animal is ordered to be impounded pursuant to this subsection, the person who owns, harbors, keeps or possesses such animal shall be entitled to a hearing in the municipal court within 14 days of such impoundment to review the propriety of such impoundment and whether a bond may be posted. Impoundment expenses shall be assessed as court costs against a convicted owner and any bond may be applied to such costs. If the owner is personally served with the citation and fails to make an appearance to answer the charges within 72 hours after the failure to appear, the court shall release the animal to the humane society or a proper holding facility. If the citation is mailed to a presumed owner, and the presumed owner fails to appear before the court to answer the charges, the court shall release the animal to the humane society or a proper holding facility 20 days after the failure to appear.

(c) Dogs seized in connection with dog fighting shall be housed in a secure enclosure with proper exercise and care and held as evidence in the case until the conclusion of the case and order from the court on the disposition of the dogs. Disposition and release of dogs is determined in accordance to K.S.A. 21-6412 and 21-6414 and any amendments thereto.

(d) Any police officer, reserve police officer or animal control officer of the city is authorized to issue a uniform complaint and notice to appear to any person who owns, harbors, keeps or possesses a dangerous dog when such officer has probable cause of an act or acts which are made unlawful by the provisions of this section have occurred.

(e) Dangerous Dog At-Large. Any dog that has been found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog under the previous Topeka City Code 18-8 or this section, that is not confined or registered as required pursuant to this chapter shall be impounded by an animal control officer or a law enforcement officer. Upon conviction, in addition to all costs for impoundment, the owner or keeper shall pay a fine of at least $250.00 but not more than $499.00. For a second offense within 24 months, in which the dog is not confined or registered as required pursuant to this section, in addition to all costs for impoundment, the owner or keeper shall pay a $499.00 fine and the animal control officer or law enforcement officer is empowered to impound the dog, and the dog shall be destroyed. The municipal judge shall have no authority to suspend the fine or any portion thereof.

(f) Dangerous Dog – Attack on Human. Upon conviction of this section, a dog may be destroyed if the dog attacks a human being which results in great bodily harm or death. Upon conviction of this section, the court may destroy a dog that has been previously determined to be a dangerous dog as defined at TMC 6.05.010.

(g) Dangerous Dog – Attack on Other Animal. Upon conviction of this section, a dog may be destroyed if the dog attacks a domestic animal which results in great bodily harm or death. Upon conviction of this section, the court may destroy a dog that has been previously determined to be a dangerous dog as defined at TMC 6.05.010.

(h) The impounded dog shall not be destroyed pending appeals of convictions under this chapter. The dog shall remain impounded pending the determination of the complaint. If the court shall find that there shall not have been a violation, such dog shall be released to the custody of the owner. In addition to the fines provided in this section, the municipal judge shall have the authority to sentence the person adjudicated guilty of this chapter to serve up to a maximum of six months in jail.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary and irrespective of whether the dog has been declared dangerous pursuant to this chapter, the municipal judge may order any dog destroyed if the municipal judge determines that the dog is an immediate threat to public health and safety and that confinement and registration of the dog by the owner or keeper of the dog as provided in this chapter will not adequately protect public health and safety. No person shall harbor, own, or possess a dog that is an immediate threat to public health and safety. In making such determination the municipal judge may consider the severity of the attack and such other relevant information. The municipal judge shall have the authority to sentence the person adjudicated guilty of this section to serve up to a maximum of six months in jail and to pay a fine not to exceed $1,000.

Article I. Generally


8.05.010 Definitions.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

“Alarm system” means an assembly of equipment and devices, or a single device such as a solid state unit which plugs directly into a 110-volt AC line, arranged to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to which police are expected to respond. The term “alarm system” shall include the terms “burglar alarm systems,” and “holdup alarm systems.” Fire alarm systems and alarm systems which monitor temperature, humidity or any other condition not directly related to the detection of an unauthorized intrusion into a premises or an attempted robbery at a premises are specifically excluded from the provisions of this chapter.

“Alarm user” means any person on whose premises an alarm system is maintained within the city, except for alarm systems on motor vehicles or proprietary systems. If, however, an alarm system on a motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a premises (other than a proprietary system), the person using such system is an alarm user. Also excluded from this definition and from the coverage of this chapter are persons who use alarm systems to alert or signal persons within the premises in which the alarm system is located, of an attempted unauthorized intrusion or holdup attempt. If such a system, however, employs an audible signal emitting sounds or a flashing light or beacon designed to signal persons outside the premises, such system shall be within the definition of alarm system and shall be subject to this chapter.

“Answering service” means a telephone answering service providing among its services the service of receiving on a continuous basis, through trained employees, emergency signals from alarm systems, and thereafter immediately relaying the message by live voice to the communication center of the police department.

“Automatic dialing device” means any alarm system which automatically sends over regular telephone lines, by direct connection or otherwise, a prerecorded voice message or coded signal indicating the existence of the emergency situation that the alarm system is designed to detect.

“Bank Protection Act” refers to United States Public Law 90-389 (Bank Protection Act of 1968), or amendments thereto.

“Burglar alarm system” refers to an alarm system signaling an entry or attempted entry into the premises protected by the system.

“Central station” means any facility, central station, modified central station or answering service operated by any person engaged in the occupation of selling, renting, leasing, installing, maintaining, operating or repairing an alarm system, which facility is manned at all times by operators employed to receive, record and validate alarm signals transmitted to such facility and to relay information about such signals to the police department by a direct telephone line.

“Direct connection” means an alarm system which has the capability of transmitting system signals to and receiving them at an agency maintained by the city; for example, a police communication center.

“Direct line” means a telephone line leading from a central station to the communication center of the police department that is for use only to report emergency signals on a person-to-person basis.

“False alarm” means an alarm signal eliciting a response by the police where an emergency situation does not in fact exist, but does not include an alarm caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm business operator or alarm user.

“Holdup alarm system” refers to an alarm system signaling a robbery or an attempted robbery.

“Interconnect” means to connect an alarm system to a voice grade telephone line, either directly or through a mechanical device that utilizes a standard telephone, for the purpose of using the telephone line to transmit an emergency message upon the activation of the alarm system.

“Local alarm system” means a signaling system which when activated causes an audible or visual signaling device to be activated in or on the premises within which the system is installed.

“Modified central station” means an office to which remote alarm and supervisory signaling devices are connected, where operators supervise the circuits. Such modified central stations are not listed by Underwriters’ Laboratories.

“Person” means any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization of any kind. It does not, however, include a governmental agency.

“Police” or “police department” means the publicly supported police department of the city, or any authorized agent thereof.

“Police chief” means the chief of police of the city, or a designated representative.

“Primary trunk line” means a telephone line leading directly into the communication center of the police department that is for the purpose of handling emergency calls on a person-to-person basis, and which is identified as such as a specific number included among the emergency numbers listed in the telephone directory issued by the telephone company and covering the service area within the police department jurisdiction.

“Proprietary system” means an alarm system sounding or recording alarm and supervisory signals to a control center located within the protected premises, the control center being under the supervision of the proprietor of the premises. If a proprietary system includes a signal line connected directly or by means of any automatic dialing device to a police communication center, a central station, modified central station or answering service, it thereby becomes an alarm system.

“Remote signaling system” means an alarm signaling system which when activated by an alarm device transmits a signal from an alarm signaling device to a central location, other than the police department, where appropriate action is taken to investigate and respond to the signal.

“Shall” is always mandatory, not merely directory.

“Signal line” means the transmission line through which the signal passes from one of the elements of the signal transmission to another.

“Special trunk line” means a telephone line leading into the communication center of the police department and having the primary purpose of handling emergency signals or messages originating either directly or through a central location from automatic dialing devices.

“Telephone company” means the utility that furnishes telephone services to the city. (Code 1981 § 34-141. Code 1995 § 62-91.)

(Code 1981 § 34-148. Code 1995 § 62-94.)


8.05.050 Notice of disruption of service.

When an alarm business’ service to subscribers is disrupted for any reason by the alarm business, or the alarm business becomes aware of such disruption, it shall promptly notify its subscriber by telephone that protection is no longer being provided. If, however, the alarm business has written instructions from its subscriber not to make such notification by telephone during certain hours, the alarm business may comply with such instructions. (Code 1981 § 34-149. Code 1995 § 62-95.)


8.05.060 Direct connections to police department.

Upon the favorable recommendation of the police chief and the approval of the council, alarms from government agencies and financial institutions may be terminated in the police department. No other alarms may terminate in the police department. (Code 1981 § 34-150. Code 1995 § 62-96.)

8.55.010 Definitions.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

“Alarm system” is any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an emergency activity requiring immediate attention and to which public safety personnel are expected to respond. Alarm systems that are designed only to alert persons other than public safety personnel to a medical emergency or to alert persons on the premises, including no outside detectable audible or visual signal and that do not cause undue annoyance of persons on adjoining properties, need not meet the requirements of this chapter.

“Alarm user” is any person in possession of any building, structure or facility, or part thereof, upon which an alarm system is located; any person who purchases, leases, contracts for or otherwise obtains an alarm system; any person who contracts for the servicing or maintenance of an alarm system; or any person who contracts with or hires an alarm business to monitor an alarm system. Alarm users who are in possession of any building or portion of any building designed/used exclusively for one-family and two-family residential dwellings need not meet the requirements of this chapter unless otherwise required by code to have an alarm system.

“CECC” is the Shawnee County Emergency Communications Center.

“False alarm” is an alarm signal eliciting a response by public safety personnel when a situation requiring an immediate response does not in fact exist. An alarm will not be considered a false alarm if the fire chief or designee determines that the alarm was caused by:

(1) Natural or manmade catastrophe or an act of God. Such events include tornadoes, floods, earthquakes or other similarly violent conditions.

(2) Vandalism causing physical damage to the premises.

(3) Telephone or data line malfunction verified in writing to the fire chief by an authorized telephone or digital service provider representative within seven days of the occurrence.

(4) Electrical service interruption verified in writing to the fire chief by an authorized electric utility representative within seven days of the occurrence.

(5) An actual emergency situation.

“Nuisance system” is an alarm system that has had 11 false alarms within a calendar year.

“Public safety personnel” are members of the Topeka fire department. (Ord. 20121 § 1, 5-15-18.)

    Cross References: Definitions generally, TMC 1.10.020.


8.55.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to reduce automatic alarm system activations where no emergency exists, thereby reducing unnecessary responses by public safety personnel to false alarms. This chapter is not intended to be punitive to the alarm user, but remedial. (Ord. 20121 § 2, 5-15-18.)


8.55.030 Registration requirements.

(a) Each alarm user shall be required to register any alarm system with the fire chief or designee before the alarm system is activated or placed into service; except that alarm systems placed into service before the effective date of this chapter shall be registered within 30 days of the effective date. A separate alarm registration is required for each premises served by the alarm system. Alarm system registrations are nontransferable.

(b) All registrations and renewals shall be completed using a form provided by the fire chief or designee.

(c) Alarm registrations shall expire one year after the date of issuance and shall be updated if the alarm user is no longer contracting with the alarm business identified on the registration form. The fire chief or designee shall notify the alarm user of the necessity to renew the alarm registration 30 days prior to the expiration date.

(d) Failure to obtain a valid registration for an alarm system under this section shall subject the alarm user to a nonregistration penalty of $50.00. (Ord. 20121 § 3, 5-15-18.)


8.55.040 Grace period.

After the effective date of this chapter, false alarms reported, or caused to be reported, within the first 60 days following installation of the alarm system shall not be subject to the fee assessment. (Ord. 20121 § 4, 5-15-18.)


8.55.050 Alarm system testing.

It shall be the responsibility of the alarm user to take the system out of service or notify the CECC prior to any alarm system testing. Failure of the alarm user to make proper notification may result in a system activation to be classified as a false alarm. (Ord. 20121 § 5, 5-15-18.)


8.55.060 Fee assessment.

(a) Any person using an alarm system that reports, or causes to report, false alarms shall be assessed a fee based on the number of responses to false fire alarms within a calendar year. Calendar year shall be deemed to be the remainder of 2018 following the effective date of this section and thereafter calendar year shall be from January 1st to December 31st.

	FALSE ALARM RESPONSES	 FEE

	0 – 3	No charge

	4 – 10	$50.00 per occurrence

	11 – 20	$100.00 per occurrence

	21 – 30	$150.00 per occurrence

	31 – 50	$200.00 per occurrence

	51 or more	$500.00 per occurrence

(b) An invoice assessing a false alarm fee will be delivered to the alarm user by regular mail or by email and the fee is due within 30 days of the date of the invoice assessing the fee.

(c) Any person who receives an invoice imposing a fee, charge or penalty may, within 10 business days from the date of the invoice, appeal all or part of the fee, charge or penalty in accordance with TMC 2.145.020. (Ord. 20121 § 6, 5-15-18.)


8.55.070 Alarm system certification.

(a) Any alarm system that has been designated a nuisance system may be required by the fire chief or designee to undergo a service inspection and certification by a fire alarm contractor with a current license in accordance with Chapter 5.15 TMC.

(b) Failure to provide a certification required by subsection (a) of this section may result in the fire chief or designee ordering a fire watch in accordance with adopted codes. (Ord. 20121 § 7, 5-15-18.)

Chapter 8.65 REGISTRATION OF VACANT PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS

Sections:

8.65.010    Purpose and intent.

8.65.020    Definitions.

8.65.030    Establishment of a registry.

8.65.040    Registration of property subject to mortgage foreclosure.

8.65.050    Registration of vacant property.

8.65.060    Maintenance requirements.

8.65.070    Security requirements.


8.65.010 Purpose and intent.

It is the purpose and intent of the Governing Body to establish a process to address the deterioration, crime, and decline in value of properties located in neighborhoods caused by properties with mortgages in foreclosure and to identify, regulate, limit and reduce the number of these properties. The Governing Body finds that occupied structures are generally better maintained when compared to vacant structures. Chronically vacant and unutilized structures or structures owned by individuals who are economically strained and unable to meet their mortgage obligations are often not properly or diligently maintained, which contribute to blight, lower property values, and have a negative impact on the residential areas where they are located. It is the Governing Body’s further intent to establish a registration program as a mechanism to help protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance of properties that are in foreclosure or are chronically vacant and unutilized. (Ord. 20223 § 1, 11-19-19.)

9.25.010 Policy.

The council recognizes the fact that many tenants hesitate to defend their right to a clean, safe and sanitary dwelling unit due to fear of eviction.

It shall be unlawful for any owner or landlord of any dwelling to commence any action or proceeding to recover possession of a dwelling unit from a tenant, demand an increase in rent from the tenant, decrease services to which the tenant has been entitled, or otherwise cause the tenant to involuntarily quit the dwelling unit within six months after any of the following acts have occurred:

(a) The tenant has complained, in good faith, either to the landlord or to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of statutes, ordinances or regulations pertaining to the maintenance of safe and sanitary dwellings, of conditions in or affecting his dwelling unit which constitutes a violation of any statute, ordinance or regulation pertaining to the maintenance of safe and sanitary dwellings; or a government official has filed a notice or complaint of such violation.

Article II. School Speed Zones

    State Law References: Authority for school speed zones, K.S.A. 8-1560(a)(4), 8-2002(a)(11).


10.20.130 Declaration of purpose.

It is hereby determined and declared that speed zones be established within the city for the purpose of safety of children attending school. (Ord. 17815 § 1, 4-9-02; Code 1981 § 43-323. Code 1995 § 142-211.)


10.20.140 Definitions.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(a) “Adjacent school speed zone” means that portion of any street where the speed limit is normally 30 miles per hour or less located within 150 feet, or where the speed limit is normally more than 30 miles per hour located within 250 feet, of the property boundary of any public or private school building or schoolyard housing elementary or middle school students.

(b) “Crosswalk school speed zone” means:

(1) That portion of any through street where the speed limit is normally 30 miles per hour or less located within 150 feet, or where the speed limit is normally more than 30 miles per hour located within 250 feet, in either direction of a marked crosswalk associated with a public or private school building or schoolyard housing elementary or middle school students.

(2) The crosswalk school speed limit zones set out in this section shall not apply to those designated crosswalks across state highways or on streets where pedestrian-actuated traffic signals are installed to aid the pedestrian in crossing.

For the purposes of this article, “school zone” means either an adjacent school speed zone or crosswalk school speed zone. (Ord. 17815 § 2, 4-9-02; Ord. 17190 § 1, 10-21-97; Code 1981 § 43-324. Code 1995 § 142-212.)


10.20.150 Posting of signs – Deviations authorized.

(a) The transportation operations division shall place and maintain signs at all adjacent school zones and crosswalk school zones where a reduced speed limit is necessary during certain hours of school days for the safety of children. Signs shall be in conformity with the standard size, color and height of other speed limit signs within the city. The signs shall state the maximum school zone speed limit of 20 miles per hour. The signs shall be positioned in a manner and at locations visible to approaching traffic, not to interfere with ingress to or egress from driveways, and not extend into a roadway. Placement of the signs may exceed the exact distances contained in TMC 10.20.140 when necessary due to obstructions at the exact location. Deviations from such distances shall not reduce the actual dimensions of any school zone.

(b) In each case where a deviation is necessary from the exact distances set out in TMC 10.20.140, its location and a statement of the reason for such deviation shall be indexed and filed as a public record within the transportation operations division.

(c) In addition to school zone speed limit signs, the transportation operation division may, in its discretion, also paint or attach upon the street pavement within any school zone or upon the approach to any school zone the words “School Speed Zone” or similar markings designed to alert oncoming motorists of the existence of the school zone. Such words or markings shall not expand nor reduce the actual dimensions of any school zone. The absence or obscured visibility of such words or markings shall not constitute a defense to a traffic charge of exceeding the posted school zone speed limit.

(d) In addition to school zone speed limit signs, the transportation operations division shall install and maintain a sign clearly displaying the times of day during which the school zone speed limit is in effect on school days, or at the city’s discretion, place and maintain flashing yellow lights above or beside school zone speed limit signs to alert oncoming motorists of the effective times of the school zone. When such flashing yellow lights are activated they shall establish or indicate the effective times of any school zone. A sign will be posted with the speed limit sign stating the school zone is in effect when flashing. Evidence that the lights were functioning properly before and after any violation of a school speed zone limit constitutes prima facie proof that the lights were functioning properly at the time of the violation. (Ord. 17815 § 3, 4-9-02; Code 1981 § 43-325. Code 1995 § 142-213.)

10.20.160 Maximum school zone speed limit.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to drive a motor vehicle in excess of 20 miles per hour in any school zone marked by effective times or flashing yellow lights as provided in TMC 10.20.140 and 10.20.150.

(b) The effective times of day for each school zone shall be established by the traffic operations division in conjunction with the school authorities of the affected schools. The traffic operations division shall maintain a public record of the established effective times for each school zone.

(c) It is permissible for the effective times of day and durations of school zones servicing any public or private elementary or middle school to vary from the effective times and durations of any or all other school zones within the city, as deemed necessary by the transportation operations division. The fact that the effective times and durations of a school zone vary from others within the city shall not constitute a defense to a traffic charge of exceeding that posted school zone speed limit. (Ord. 17815 § 4, 4-9-02; Ord. 17190 § 2, 10-21-97; Code 1981 § 43-327. Code 1995 § 142-214.)

10.20.170 Penalties for violation.

(a) Every person, upon a conviction of a moving violation, as defined in K.S.A. 8-249 and Kansas Administrative Regulations 92-52-9, in a school zone, shall be fined three times the amount on the fine schedule as set by the municipal court in accordance with TMC 2.110.330, with the exception of those offenses excluded by TMC 2.110.330; such fine shall not be paroled or otherwise reduced.

(b) The municipal court is hereby authorized to establish mandatory court appearances for any person charged with violating a school zone speed limit in an amount the court finds to be excessive. (Ord. 19652 § 3, 10-11-11.)

(a) The traffic engineer is hereby authorized to determine those intersections at which drivers of vehicles shall not make a right, left or U-turn, and shall place proper signs at such intersections. The making of such turns may be prohibited between certain hours of any day and permitted at other hours, in which event the same shall be plainly indicated on the signs or they may be removed when such turns are permitted.

(b) Whenever authorized signs are erected indicating that no right, left or U-turn is permitted, no driver of a vehicle shall disobey the directions of any such sign. (Code 1981 § 43-198. Code 1995 § 142-237.)

10.20.210 Left turns by franchised buses.

A left turn from a curb or righthand lane may be made by a licensed and franchised bus when such turn is made in connection with a regularly scheduled bus route which has been filed with the city, and such turn will not be considered a violation of this chapter. Such turns must be made with all due regard for the safety of other vehicles and drivers, and the bus shall yield the right-of-way to all other vehicles. (Code 1981 § 43-202. Code 1995 § 142-239.)


10.20.220 Turning left into alley or driveway prohibited – Exceptions.

Where posted, it shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle on a two-way, through highway or through street within the core area to turn left into an alley or private driveway; provided, such turn shall be lawful where a barrier median left-turn bay has been provided therefor. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the driver of any vehicle from turning left into an alley or private driveway from any other highway or street in the city after yielding the right-of-way to approaching vehicles and giving the signals required by law for turning left at intersections of streets having two-way roadways, unless prohibited by appropriate signs. (Code 1981 § 43-203. Code 1995 § 142-240.)

(a) No vehicle shall be towed away or otherwise taken into possession or custody by members of the police department unless and until the owner or person in possession of the private property on which the vehicle is abandoned shall sign a complaint and a hold-harmless agreement. The signing of the complaint shall be deemed conclusive of the complainant’s consent and promise to pay the costs of towing or removing the vehicle and the reasonable storage charges therefor if the complaint is withdrawn by the complainant or is found to have been made by mistake or error or if the vehicle is not claimed and the city is not otherwise reimbursed for such towing or removing or storage charges, in which latter event, the complainant shall be deemed liable to the city, as concerns towing, removing and storage costs, only to the extent the city is not so reimbursed.

(b) The purpose of the hold-harmless agreement required by this section shall be to make the complainant:

(1) Primarily liable, instead of the city, and to exonerate the city and hold it blameless and without liability to any person on account of any injuries or damages or other cause of action that might accrue to the owner of the vehicle or to any other person arising out of the towing, removing, storing or the taking and during the period of possession or custody of the vehicle by the city or its employees or agents; and

(1) Description of the vehicle;

(2) Date of abandonment;

(3) Address of the place of abandonment;

(4) Name of the owner or person in lawful possession of the property upon which the vehicle is abandoned;

(5) Name of the principal for whom an agent is acting, if applicable;

10.25.040 Notification of impoundment and procedure for claiming impounded vehicles.

(a) The city adopts the provisions of K.S.A. 8-1101 and 8-1102 and amendments thereto, with regard to impounding, storage, notification to owners and lienholders of record concerning the seizure and disposition of abandoned vehicles. Such notice is to be mailed before the close of the first full working day after the towing.

(b) Once a vehicle has been impounded, the owner/lienholder may:

(1) Immediately pay the accrued towing fee and storage charges, and thereby regain possession;

(2) Sign a signature bond in the amount of the accrued towing fee and storage charges, and thereby regain possession; or

(3) Refuse the options in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, and demand a hearing on the validity of the towing, to be held before the municipal court judge before the second full working day following such demand. Before the owner/lienholder can regain possession, however, the municipal court judge must determine whether or not there was probable cause for the towing. If there was probable cause, the judge will thereby order the owner/lienholder to comply with subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section before possession may be regained. If no probable cause for the towing can be shown, the vehicle shall be returned to the owner/lienholder.

No vehicle shall be returned until the owner/lienholder provides sufficient documentation to establish right to possession. After the vehicle is returned to the owner/lienholder pursuant to this subsection, trial on the traffic violation which led to the actual towing shall then be scheduled in accordance with the normal municipal court schedule. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the owner/lienholder from entering a plea of guilty, paying all fines and charges incurred and thus avoiding going to trial.

(c) Whenever a traffic violation is dismissed, or an owner/lienholder is acquitted, or it is otherwise determined that the towing of a vehicle was improper, and the owner/lienholder has already paid the towing fee and storage charges pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, such fees and charges shall be automatically refunded by the city. Refunds may be ordered by the municipal court, and the owner/lienholder shall not be required to resort to the procedure of submitting a claim for the city council’s consideration.

(d) The right of the owner/lienholder, in addition to being set forth in the certified letter as provided for in subsection (a) of this section, shall be made known by the posting of prominent signs in English and Spanish at the police department impoundment lot and also at the police headquarters where the owner/lienholder may inquire as to the status of such vehicle. (Ord. 16436 § 1(43-405), 3-17-92. Code 1995 § 142-269.)

10.25.060 Disposing of vehicles as junk.

(a) When. Any vehicle subject to the provisions of this chapter which has been impounded by the police department and which has been determined by the chief of police to be either not in a running condition or of a fair market value of less than $50.00 may be considered as junk, rather than a vehicle, and disposed of as provided by this section.

(b) Notice of Sale. If the owner of an impounded vehicle described in subsection (a) of this section is known, the owner shall be given notice by certified mail that the vehicle will be sold for junk in 10 days if the owner does not claim the vehicle. If the owner is not known, the vehicle can be sold for junk after one publication in the official city newspaper, stating that the vehicle will be disposed of for junk not less than 10 days following the publication and specifically describing the vehicle to be junked. Junked vehicles sold under this section may be sold individually or in lots and shall be sold only to a licensed junk dealer making the highest cash bid thereon and paying cash therefor. (Code 1981 § 43-407. Code 1995 § 142-271.)


10.25.070 Proceeds of sales.

Other tires or devices may be approved and recognized by the director of the public works department and the police department as being satisfactory devices or tires for the maintenance of traction under adverse climatic and street conditions. A list of other tires and devices which are approved by the director of the public works department and by the police department shall be available for inspection at the police department and at the office of the director of the public works department.

(1) Pay the indicated fine; or

(2) Submit the written materials to obtain an adjudication by mail; or

(3) Request an administrative hearing as enumerated herein to contest the charged violation.

A response by mail shall be deemed timely if postmarked within five work days of the issuance of the notice of the violation. A timely request for a hearing or adjudication by mail shall toll the running of work days for purposes of the fine schedule.

(b) If the respondent submits documentary evidence to obtain an adjudication by mail, the city traffic compliance administrator shall send the respondent a copy of the hearing officer’s determination in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.

(c) If the respondent requests an administrative hearing to contest the cited violation, the city traffic compliance administrator shall notify the respondent in writing of the location and time available for a hearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.

Where a respondent who has requested an administrative hearing either fails to pay the indicated fine prior to the hearing or fails to appear at the hearing, a determination of parking violation liability shall be entered in the amount of the fine indicated on the fine schedule. Upon the occurrence of a final determination of liability, any unpaid fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the city. The city traffic compliance administrator will cause a notice of hearing providing this information to be sent to the respondent in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.

(d) If no response is made in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the city traffic compliance administrator shall cause a second notice of violation to be sent to the respondent in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. The notice shall specify the date and location of the violation, the make and state registration number of the cited vehicle, the code provision violated, the applicable fine, and the time and manner in which the respondent may obtain an adjudication by mail or request a hearing to contest the violation. If the respondent requests an administrative hearing to contest the cited violation, the city traffic compliance administrator will cause a notice of hearing to be sent to the respondent as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

If the respondent fails to pay the indicated fine, submit documentary evidence to obtain an adjudication by mail, or request a hearing to contest the charged violation within 10 work days from the date of the second notice, final determination of liability shall be entered in the amount in accordance with the fine schedule. Final determination of liability, for the purposes of subsection (d) of this section, shall be entered automatically and shall not require additional written notice. Failure to pay the fine within 10 work days of issuance of the determination of liability will result in the imposition of enhanced penalty in accordance with the provisions of the fine schedule. Enhanced penalties will continue to accrue for unpaid fines in accordance with the provisions of the fine schedule. Upon the occurrence of a final determination of liability, any unpaid fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the city. The second notice of violation shall provide the above information.

(e) The city traffic compliance administrator shall serve the notice of hearing, the second notice of violation, the hearing officer’s determination, and the notice of final determination of liability, when required, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the vehicle as registered with the Division of Motor Vehicles, Department of Revenue, state of Kansas, or by hand delivery. If the vehicle is registered in a state other than Kansas, the city traffic compliance administrator shall send the appropriate notice to the address of the registered owner as recorded in such other state’s registry of motor vehicles.

All such notices will be delivered by first class mail and shall be deemed served as of the date of deposit in the U.S. mail.

(c) Immobilization Device Unusable. If the vehicle subject to immobilization cannot be fitted with a device because of the vehicle’s size or shape, then the vehicle may be impounded in accordance with the procedures for impoundment set forth in TMC 10.60.660. (Ord. 19589 § 2, 6-14-11.)


10.60.630 Unauthorized removal of vehicle or device prohibited.

This does not preclude the registered owner or lessee from subsequently contesting the immobilization pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section. If successful, the person will be reimbursed the amount of the removal charge.

(b) After payment of all fines and removal charges, the registered owner or lessee may contest the immobilization only if the registered owner or lessee submits, within five business days of the date the immobilization device was affixed to the vehicle, written materials to obtain adjudication by mail. Compliance with this time limit shall be a jurisdictional prerequisite. Failure to comply shall bar any contest.

(1) The request shall include an affidavit, signed by the owner and made subject to the penalties of perjury, that the owner denies there are three or more unpaid parking violations outstanding against the license plate on the vehicle at the time of immobilization.

(2) The notice affixed to the vehicle or a copy thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts specified therein.

(1) Administrative hearings shall be held before the city’s administrative hearing officer. The registered owner or lessee may appear with or without an attorney.

(7) The hearing officer shall determine whether there is proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the immobilization was warranted and shall notify, in writing, the owner or lessee. (Ord. 19765 § 3, 10-2-12.)


10.60.660 Vehicle impoundment – Procedure to reclaim vehicle.

(a) If a vehicle remains immobilized after 48 hours from the date of the notice in TMC 10.60.640, it will be subject to impoundment by the police department. Members of the police department are authorized to remove such vehicle to the nearest private garage or a place designated or maintained by the police department and hold it until the requirements for claiming the vehicle in subsection (c) of this section are satisfied.

(b) A written notice shall be sent by first class mail to the registered owner and lienholder of record within 48 hours of the vehicle’s removal advising such person(s) of the procedures available to regain possession of the vehicle and challenge the impoundment.

(c) Once a vehicle has been impounded, the registered owner or lienholder may:

(1) Regain possession by paying all charges associated with the impoundment, including but not limited to the removal fee, parking fines, towing fees, and storage charges;

(2) Regain possession by signing a signature bond in the amount of the charges in subsection (c)(1) of this section; or

(3) Request a hearing on the validity of the impoundment to be held before the municipal court judge before the seventh business day following such request. Before the registered owner or lienholder can regain possession, the municipal court judge must determine whether or not there was probable cause for the impoundment. If there was probable cause, the judge will order the registered owner or lienholder to comply with subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section before possession may be regained. If no probable cause for the impoundment can be shown, the vehicle shall be returned to the registered owner or lienholder. No vehicle shall be returned until the registered owner or lienholder provides sufficient documentation to establish right to possession.

(4) The purpose of the hearing in subsection (c)(3) of this section will be to determine whether the impoundment was warranted. If the impoundment was not warranted and the registered owner or lienholder has previously paid the charges identified in subsection (c)(1) of this section, such charges shall be refunded by the city. Refunds may be ordered by the municipal court and the registered owner or lienholder shall not be required to submit a claim to the city council.

(d) Personal property found in the vehicle may be released at any time to the owner of such property upon presentation of proof of ownership or right to possession of such personal property. (Ord. 19589 § 6, 6-14-11.)


10.60.670 Disposition of impounded vehicles by public sale.

(a) Disposition of vehicles which remain unclaimed by the registered owner or lienholder of record for a period of 30 days or more shall be done in compliance with the procedures for impoundment, notice and public auction provided by K.S.A. 8-1102(a)(2) and amendments thereto.

(b) Pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102 and amendments thereto, all moneys derived from the sale of motor vehicles, after payment of the expenses of impoundment and sale, shall be paid into the fund for construction and maintenance of streets. No moneys derived from the sale of motor vehicles shall be used for the payment of parking fines. (Ord. 19589 § 7, 6-14-11.)

When the charge is made for waiting time, no charge shall be made for stops occasioned by the driver or by reason of any defective or improper working conditions of the taxicab nor shall a charge be made because of premature arrival upon a call.

For each inspection made by the city as provided in this section, there shall be paid to the city clerk a fee of $10.00 by the owner or operator of such taxicab. In the event a taximeter fails to pass inspection, the fee for each reinspection shall be an additional $10.00. In case inspection is made upon complaint as provided in this section and such taximeter is found to be correct, such inspection fee shall be paid by the person making the complaint and not by the owner or operator of such taxicab.

12.30.010 Findings and purpose.

The city of Topeka holds the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries in trust for its citizens. The city and other public entities have invested public funds to build and maintain the rights-of-way.

The city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances. Although the citizens of Topeka bear the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way, a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is frequent excavation.

Right-of-way obstruction is a source of frustration for merchants, business owners and the citizenry who must avoid these obstructions or change travel or shopping plans because of them. Obstructions also have a detrimental effect on commerce. Entities whose equipment is within the right-of-way are the primary cause of these frequent obstructions.

In response to the foregoing facts, the city hereby enacts the following provisions relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this chapter, entities disturbing and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for their integrity. (Ord. 17587 § 1, 10-24-00.

12.30.120 Right-of-way repair and restoration.

(a) Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the repair and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under TMC 12.30.150.

In addition to repairing its own work the permittee must restore any disturbed surrounding area of the work, including the paving and its foundations, in accordance with the city of Topeka Standard Technical Specifications and Detail Drawings, latest edition. The permittee must also maintain this affected area in an acceptable condition for 36 months thereafter.

(b) Standards. The permittee shall perform repairs and restoration according to the city of Topeka Standard Technical Specifications and Detail Drawings, latest edition. The director shall prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and shall do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The director in exercising this authority shall be guided by the city of Topeka Standard Technical Specifications and Detail Drawings, latest edition, and the following considerations:

(1) The number, size, depth, and duration of the excavations, disruptions, or damage to the right-of-way.

(2) The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way and the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way.

(3) The preexcavation condition of the right-of-way and the remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation.

(4) Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance, or damage to the right-of-way.

(5) The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place.

(c) Guarantees. The permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 36 months following its completion. During this 36-month period it shall, upon notification from the director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the director. Said work shall be completed within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the director, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under TMC 12.30.150. The guarantee applies to faulty materials, quality of workmanship, the quality of compaction of the base, and subbase materials when performing excavations.

(d) Failure to Restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the director, the city, at its option, may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the restoration/performance bond. (Ord. 17587 § 5-8, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-683.)

12.30.130 Joint applications by registrants.

(a) Joint Application. Registrants may jointly apply for right-of-way permits at the same place and time.

(b) With City Projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled excavation undertaken by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the right-of-way permit fees.

(c) Shared Fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. Registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their application. (Ord. 17587 § 5-9, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-684.)


12.30.140 Supplementary applications.

(a) Limitation on Area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee who determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area: (1) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby; and (2) be granted a new permit or permit extension.

(b) Limitation on Dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time needed, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. The supplementary application must be done before the permit end date. (Ord. 17587 § 5-10, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-685.)


12.30.150 Other obligations.

(a) Compliance with Other Laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve the permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, authority and to pay all fees required by any other city, county, state, or federal rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including K.S.A. 1998 Supp. 66-1800 et seq. (“One call excavation notice system”). A permittee shall cause all work to be performed in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.

(b) Prohibited Work. Except in an emergency, no right-of-way excavation may be done when prohibited by weather conditions or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.

(c) Interference with Right-of-Way. A permittee shall not obstruct right-of-way so that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways is interfered with. Private vehicles may not be parked within or next to a permit area. The loading or unloading of trucks next to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the permit. (Ord. 17587 § 5-11, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-686.)


12.30.160 Denial of permit.

(a) Mandatory Denial. Except in an emergency, no right-of-way permit will be granted:

(1) To any person required by TMC 12.30.050 to be registered who has not done so;

(2) To any person required by TMC 12.30.070 to file an annual report but has failed to do so;

(3) For any project which requires the excavation of any portion of a right-of-way which was constructed or reconstructed within the preceding three years;

(4) If, in the discretion of the director, the issuance of a permit for the specified date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other public event. The director, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the right-of-way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.

(b) Discretionary Issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the director may issue a permit in any case where the permit is necessary: (1) to prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the permit applicant; or (2) to allow such customer to materially improve its utility service; or (3) to allow a new economic development project; or (4) otherwise required by law.

(c) Permits for Additional Next-Year Projects. The director may issue a permit to a registrant who was allowed under TMC 12.30.070 to submit an additional next-year project. Such permit shall be subject to all other conditions and requirements of law, including such conditions as may be imposed under TMC 12.30.100. (Ord. 17587 § 5-12, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-687.)

12.30.170 Installation requirements.

Permittee/registrant shall be required to participate in the construction of handicap ramps at intersections where the curb and/or sidewalk are disturbed due to permittee/registrant work. The city is responsible for installation of all new ramps. For new construction the permittee/registrant will replace any curb section removed with a handicapped accessible curb section. Temporary sidewalk will be provided by the permittee/registrant until the city can install the ramp. If the handicapped accessible curb section cannot be installed by the permittee/registrant due to design considerations related to the proper ramp installation, the permittee/registrant will be billed by the city for the pro rata cost of curb installation when completed. The permittee/registrant are responsible for total replacement of any existing ramps and curb sections that might be damaged during permittee/registrant installations or repairs. (Ord. 17587 § 5-13, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-688.)


12.30.180 Inspection.

(a) Site Inspection. The permittee shall make the work site available to the director and to all others as designated by the director for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.

(b) Authority of Director. At the time of inspection the director or designee may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public. The director may issue a corrective order to the registrant for any work which does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within 10 days after issuance of the order, the registrant shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to TMC 12.30.200. (Ord. 17587 § 5-14, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-689.)

12.30.190 Work done without a permit.

(a) Emergency Situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any major event regarding its equipment which it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.

If the director becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s equipment, the director will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the director may take whatever action deemed necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose equipment caused the emergency.

(b) Nonemergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way shall subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the city code, deposit with the director the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.

12.30.200 Revocation of permits.

(a) Substantial Breach. Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this chapter as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves the right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any condition of the permit. A breach by permittee shall include the following:

(1) The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;

(2) An evasion or attempt to evade any provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;

(3) Any misrepresentation of a material fact in the application for a right-of-way permit;

(4) The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance;

(5) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or

(6) The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to this chapter.

(b) Written Notice of Breach. If the director determines that the permittee has committed a breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the director shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a breach, as stated above, will allow the director to place additional or revised conditions on the permit.

(c) Response to Notice of Breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the director with a plan of correction, acceptable to the director; permittee’s failure to so contact the director, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.

(d) Cause for Probation. From time to time, the director may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for up to one year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of the permit.

(e) Reimbursement of City Cost. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

(f) Probationary Status. If a permittee is placed on probation, all subsequent permit fees shall be tripled. (Ord. 17587 § 5-16, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-691.)

12.30.210 Mapping data.

(a) Information Required. Except as provided for herein, each registrant shall provide to the director information indicating the horizontal and vertical (if available) location, relative to the boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it has control and which is located in any right-of-way (“mapping data”). Mapping data shall be provided with the specificity and in the format requested by the director for inclusion in the mapping system used by the director.

Within six months after the acquisition, installation, or construction of additional equipment or any relocation, abandonment, or disuse of existing equipment, each registrant shall supplement the mapping data required herein.

Each registrant shall, within six months after the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, submit a plan to the director specifying in detail the steps it will take to comply with the requirements of this section. Said plan shall provide for the submission of all mapping data (1) for the central business district within two years after the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and (2) for the remainder of the city as early as may be reasonable and practical, but not later than five years after the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, mapping data shall be submitted by all registrants for all equipment which is to be installed or constructed after the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter at the time any permits are sought under this chapter.

After six months following the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, a new registrant, or a registrant who has not submitted a plan as required above, shall submit complete and accurate mapping data for all its equipment at the time any permits are sought under this chapter.

(b) Telecommunication Equipment. Information on existing facilities and equipment of telecommunications registrants will be provided in a format that is compatible with the city geographical information system (GIS). Logistical records for underground facilities that indicate location within the right-of-way fulfill this requirement.

(c) Trade Secret Information. At the request of any registrant, any information requested by the director which qualifies as a “trade-secret” under K.S.A. 60-3320 et seq. shall be treated as trade secret information as detailed therein. (Ord. 17587 § 5-17, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-692.)

12.30.220 Location of equipment.

(a) Undergrounding. Unless otherwise permitted by an existing franchise, new utility construction undertaken by a registrant shall be installed underground or contained within buildings or other structures in conformity with applicable codes. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirement for underground utility location in the city shall be subject to the following exceptions:

(1) Temporary Exceptions. The public works director, or his or her designee, may grant a temporary exception to erect, construct, install or maintain poles, wires and other overhead structures for electrical power or communication service which is reasonably required for emergencies or for building construction purposes. The temporary exception may be granted for a period not to exceed 120 days. However, in the event the purpose for which the temporary exception referred to herein granted has not been remedied or the construction cannot be completed within the period herein provided, one additional 120-day temporary period may be granted to avoid undue hardship.

(2) Permanent Exceptions. The requirement for underground utility location shall not apply to any of the following:

(i) Three phase primary electric distribution or transmission lines with capacities of 12 kilovolts or greater that provide a primary electric source between substations or service areas and/or are utilized to transfer load to support the electric system which do not traverse a building site or subdivision which is subject to the underground utility location requirement except which are necessary to provide service thereto.

(ii) Poles, overhead wires, and associated overhead structures, for single phase electric distribution or transmission lines when part of an existing line originates in an area outside a building site or subdivision which is subject to the underground utility location requirement.

(iii) The replacement of poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures for single or three phase electric distribution or transmission lines as permitted in the aforementioned exceptions when necessary for the purpose of maintaining, altering, or upgrading the lines or service.

(iv) In-fill housing shall not be subject to the underground utility location requirement if the subdivision in which the in-fill housing is to be located is served by overhead utilities.

(v) Radio and television antennas.

(vi) Poles used exclusively for street or area lighting or for traffic control facilities.

(vii) Electric substations and the accompanying equipment and apparatus necessary to provide adequate electric service to those persons located within a building site or subdivision which is subject to the underground utility location requirement or in the surrounding area.

(viii) The public works director and planning director or their designees may jointly grant an exception from the underground utility location requirement to allow for construction of a residential or commercial structure. In granting such an exception, the following factors shall be considered:

(A) Whether a plat has been recorded.

(B) Percentage of adjacent homes constructed with above ground utilities.

(C) Location of existing above ground utilities.

(D) Location of roads or streets.

(E) Location of natural watercourses.

(F) Subsurface geological conditions.

(G) Topographical conditions.

(H) Excessive financial burden.

(b) Installation. Installation of necessary control equipment and line marker signs as required by city, state, and federal codes may be installed above ground.

(c) Corridors, Location of Utilities. The public works director or his or her designee may assign specific corridors or locations within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of equipment that is or, pursuant to current technology, the public works director or his or her designee expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation or other permits issued by the public works director or his or her designee involving the installation or replacement of equipment may designate the proper corridor for the equipment at issue. The public works director or his or her designee has final approval of all utility locations within the right-of-way.

(d) Hindrance. One year after the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, any equipment found in a right-of-way that has not been registered shall be deemed to be a hindrance to the orderly use of right-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the hindrance or taking possession of the equipment and restoring the right-of-way to a usable condition. Utility registrants may be liable for damages caused by abandoned utilities within the public right-of-way. Utility registrants exercising diligence under these conditions would be exempt from liability for damages.

(e) Limitation of Space. To protect health and safety, the public works director or his or her designee shall have the power to prohibit or limit placement of new or additional equipment within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of registrants or persons to occupy and use the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the public works director or his or her designee shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing equipment in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest. (Ord. 18177 § 1, 2-17-04; Ord. 17587 § 5-18, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-693.)

12.30.230 Relocation of equipment.

A registrant must promptly and at no expense to the city, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its equipment and facilities in the right-of-way whenever the director requests such removal and relocation, and shall restore the right-of-way to the same condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. The director may make such request to prevent interference by the registrant’s equipment or facilities with: (a) a present or future city use of the right-of-way, (b) a public improvement undertaken by the city, (c) an economic development project in which the city has an interest or investment, (d) when the public health, safety and welfare require it, or (e) when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a registrant shall not be required to remove or relocate its equipment from any right-of-way which has been vacated in favor of a nongovernmental entity unless and until the reasonable costs thereof are first paid to the registrant therefor. (Ord. 17587 § 5-19, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-694.)

12.30.240 Preexcavation equipment location.

(a) In addition to complying with the requirements of K.S.A. 1998 Supp. 66-1800 et seq. (“One call excavation notice system”) before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement, if known, of all said equipment. Any registrant whose equipment is less than 24 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface should notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its equipment and the best procedure for excavation.

(b) All locate marking shall be done using water based paint. Every effort shall be made to minimize the number and size of markings to avoid damaging city infrastructure or creating a graffiti like appearance in the public right-of-way. (Ord. 17587 § 5-20, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-695.)


12.30.250 Damage to other equipment.

If the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a registrant’s equipment to protect it, the director shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing.

Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any equipment in the right-of-way which it or its equipment damages. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the equipment of another registrant caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s equipment. (Ord. 17587 § 5-21, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-696.)

12.30.260 Right-of-way vacation.

(a) Reservation of Right. If the city vacates right-of-way which contains the equipment of a registrant, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of registrant’s equipment, the city may reserve, to and for itself and all registrants having equipment in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain and operate any equipment in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.

(b) Relocation of Equipment. If the vacation of right-of-way requires the relocation of registrant’s equipment; and (1) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the registrant, the registrant must pay the relocation costs; or (2) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the registrant must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city and the registrant; or (3) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons other than the registrant, such other person or persons must pay the relocation costs unless such costs are otherwise covered by franchise or other contractual agreement. (Ord. 17587 § 5-22, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-697.)


12.30.270 Indemnification and liability.

(a) Limitation of Liability. By reason of the acceptance of a registration or the grant of a right-of-way permit, the city does not assume any liability: (1) for injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service claims by parties other than the registrant or the city, or (2) for claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of equipment by registrants or activities of registrants.

(b) Indemnification. By registering with the director, a registrant agrees, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a permittee is required, to defend, indemnify, and hold the city whole and harmless from all costs, liabilities, and claims for damages of any kind arising out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its equipment, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a right-of-way permit. It further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the city for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its equipment, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether or not the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a right-of-way permit. The foregoing does not indemnify the city for its own negligence except for claims arising out of or alleging the city’s negligence where such negligence arises out of or is primarily related to the presence, installation, construction, operation, maintenance or repair of said equipment by the registrant or on the registrant’s behalf, including, but not limited to, the issuance of permits and inspection of plans or work. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the registrant or to the city; and the registrant, in defending any action on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf. (Ord. 17587 § 5-23, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-698.)

12.30.280 Abandoned and unusable equipment.

(a) Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue its operations in the city must either:

(1) Provide information satisfactory to the director that the registrant’s obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another registrant; or

(2) Submit to the director a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its equipment to the city. If a registrant proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option:

(i) Purchase the equipment; or

(ii) Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove it; or

(iii) Require the registrant to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the equipment.

(b) Abandoned Equipment. Equipment of a registrant who fails to comply with the above and which for two years remains unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a hindrance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limited to: (1) abating the hindrance, (2) taking possession of the equipment and restoring it to a usable condition, or (3) requiring removal of the equipment by the original registrant.

(c) Removal. In the central business district (defined in TMC 3.40.010) registrants who have unusable and abandoned equipment in any right-of-way may be required to remove it during the next scheduled excavation. (Ord. 17587 § 5-24, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-699.)

12.30.300 Right-of-way repair and restoration.

(a) Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the repair and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable as provided herein.

In addition to repairing its own work the permittee must restore any disturbed surrounding area of the work, including the paving and its foundations in accordance with the city of Topeka Standard Technical Specifications and Detail Drawings, latest edition. The permittee must also maintain this affected area in an acceptable condition for 36 months thereafter.

(b) Standards. The permittee shall perform repairs and restoration according to the city of Topeka Standard Technical Specifications and Detail Drawings, latest edition. The director shall prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and shall do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The director in exercising this authority shall be guided by the city of Topeka Standard Technical Specifications and Detail Drawings, latest edition, and the following considerations:

(1) The number, size, depth, and duration of the excavations, disruptions, or damage to the right-of-way.

(2) The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way and the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way.

(3) The preexcavation condition of the right-of-way and the remaining life expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation.

(4) Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance, or damage to the right-of-way.

(5) The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place.

(c) Guarantees. The permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 36 months following its completion. During this 36-month period it shall, upon notification from the director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the director. Said work shall be completed within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the director, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under TMC 12.30.320. The guarantee applies to faulty materials, quality of workmanship, the quality of compaction of the base, and subbase materials when performing excavations.

(d) Failure to Restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the director, the city, at its option, may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. (Ord. 17587 § 6-2, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-727.)

12.30.310 Supplementary applications.

(a) Limitation on Area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee who determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area: (1) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby, and (2) be granted a new permit or permit extension.

(b) Limitation on Dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time needed, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. The supplementary application must be done before the permit end date. (Ord. 17587 § 6-3, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-728.)


12.30.320 Other obligations.

(a) Compliance with Other Laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve the permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, authority and to pay all fees required by any other city, county, state, or federal rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including K.S.A. 1998 Supp. 66-1800 et seq. (“One call excavation notice system”). A permittee shall cause all work to be performed in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.

(b) Prohibited Work. Except in an emergency, no right-of-way excavation may be done when prohibited by weather conditions or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.

(c) Interference with Right-of-Way. A permittee shall not obstruct right-of-way so that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways is interfered with. Private vehicles may not be parked within or next to a permit area. The loading or unloading of trucks next to permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the permit. (Ord. 17587 § 6-4, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-729.)


12.30.330 Inspection.

(a) Site Inspection. The permittee shall make the work site available to the director and to all others as designated by the director for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.

(b) Authority of Director. At the time of inspection the director or designee may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public. The director may issue a corrective order to the registrant for any work which does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within 10 days after issuance of the order, the registrant shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to TMC 12.30.340. (Ord. 17587 § 6-5, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-730.)

12.30.340 Revocation of permits.

(a) Substantial Breach. Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this chapter as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves the right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any condition of the permit. A breach by permittee shall include the following:

(1) The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;

(2) An evasion or attempt to evade any provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;

(3) Any misrepresentation of a material fact in the application for a right-of-way permit;

(4) The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance;

(5) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or

(6) The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to this chapter.

(b) Written Notice of Breach. If the director determines that the permittee has committed a breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the director shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a breach, as stated above, will allow the director to place additional or revised conditions on the permit.

(c) Response to Notice of Breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the director with a plan of correction, acceptable to the director. Permittee’s failure to so contact the director, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.

(d) Cause for Probation. From time to time, the director may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for up to one year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of the permit.

(e) Reimbursement of City Costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

(f) Probationary Status. If a permittee is placed on probation, all subsequent permit fees shall be tripled. (Ord. 17587 § 6-6, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-731.)

Article IV. Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers


12.30.350 Lawful rights reserved.

The city by the granting of a right-of-way permit, or by registering a person under this chapter does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights which it has now or may be hereafter granted to the city under the Constitution and statutes of the state of Kansas (or the Charter of the city) to regulate the use of the right-of-way by the permittee; and the permittee by its acceptance of a right-of-way permit or of registration under this chapter agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A permittee or registrant is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such powers.

Any conflict between the provisions of a registration or of a right-of-way permit and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city’s regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter. (Ord. 17587 § 7, 10-24-00. Code 1995 § 130-751.)

12.30.360 Severability.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, nonappealable order that any permit, right or registration issued under this chapter or any portion of this chapter is illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit, right or registration granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving 60 days’ written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit’s right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the permit and the right of termination. If a permit, right or registration shall be considered a revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must acknowledge the authority of the city to issue such revocable permit and the power to revoke it. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein. (Ord. 17587 § 8, 10-24-00.

Article II. Construction Work in City Right-of-Way

    Editor’s Note: Ord. No. 18916, § 1, adopted June 26, 2007, amended the title of this article to read as herein set out. Formerly, said article was entitled “Construction Work.”


12.45.040 Application and permit required.

(a) Application.

(1) Any person desiring to obtain the city’s permission to access the city’s right-of-way or easements for the following purposes, including but not limited to: excavation; boring or tunneling; repair, construction or maintenance of a driveway, driveway approach or sidewalk; connection or disconnection with a water line or sewer line; or construction, repair or maintenance of an underground or overhead utility, shall first make application to the development services director or designee and secure a permit therefor.

(2) The application shall be on a form supplied by the development services director and shall contain the following:

(i) The specific location by each street address or place at which the work is to be performed;

(ii) The purpose for which the work is intended;

(iii) The dimensions: length, breadth and depth thereof;

(iv) The time when the work is to be commenced thereon;

(v) The time required to complete the work;

(vi) An agreement that the applicant shall hold the city harmless from any and all claims for injury or damages whatsoever to persons or property that may result from the contractor’s activities in the right-of-way or easement; and

(vii) An agreement that the applicant shall repair any defective work done by the applicant. Further, the applicant shall agree to reimburse the city for any costs incurred by it to repair or replace the defective work should the applicant fail to do so.

(viii) That the applicant holds a current contractor’s license under Chapter 5.63 TMC to do the work for which the permit is sought. Provided, however, any permit required by this article for the construction, repair or replacement of sidewalk, driveway or driveway approach may be issued to an unlicensed individual, provided the work to be done is for work at the applicant’s single-family dwelling, including accessory building, used exclusively for living purposes, the individual is the owner of the premises, and occupies such premises. The individual shall be responsible for all materials, labor and obtaining all necessary inspections and shall submit plans that have to be approved prior to the issuance of a permit.

(b) Permit.

(1) If the application is approved by the development services director under this article, the development services director shall issue the permit applied for upon the payment of a fee as established in a schedule maintained by the public works director or his or her designee, therefor to cover in part the expense of regulating work in the right-of-way and issuing permits therefor, and such fee shall be paid to the development services director.

(2) Where any work as set forth in this article, for which a permit is required, is commenced or proceeded with prior to obtaining such permit, the fee specified in this section shall be doubled, but the payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this article in the execution of such work, nor from any penalties prescribed in this article.

(3) Permits issued pursuant to this article shall be valid for a period of seven calendar days. The seven-day period shall include an allowance of four days for inclement weather conditions. If work delay due to inclement weather exceeds four days, the development services director may grant an extension of time. In emergency situations where excavation work must be started prior to obtaining a permit, such as during holidays or evenings, the contractor or utility company shall obtain the permit the next working day. If the work is not completed within seven days of the issuance of the permit, the permit may be extended by the development services director for an additional fee equal to the amount of the original permit fee. Where the work is estimated to exceed seven days, not more than four days shall be granted for inclement weather delays.

(c) If any person shall persistently fail, refuse or neglect to comply with the provisions of this article, or any reasonable orders and directions of the development services director in reference thereto, the development services director may refuse to issue any further permits to such party. (Ord. 18916 § 2, 6-26-07; Code 1981 § 40-48. Code 1995 § 130-156.)

No permit shall be granted under this article unless the applicant shall present to the development services director evidence of a satisfactory, public liability insurance policy covering all operations of $300,000 combined single limit for liability and property damage. Such policy may be written to allow no more than $1,000 for a paid deductible. Should any policy be cancelled, the city shall be notified of such cancellation at least 10 days prior to such cancellation becoming effective, and provisions to that effect placing upon the company writing such policy the duty to give such notice shall be incorporated in such policy. If any such insurance policy at any time fails, in the opinion of the public works director or his or her designee, to comply with the provisions of this section or to afford reasonably satisfactory protection to the persons intended to be protected thereby, he/she shall in writing so notify the applicant and the city clerk, and failure to maintain the insurance required by this section shall be grounds for revocation of any such permit and refusal to grant any further permit until such insurance requirement is met. (Ord. 18916 § 3, 6-26-07. Code 1995 § 130-157.)

12.55.010 Purpose and intent.

This chapter is for the purpose of requiring that new development pays for its fair share of public trafficways through the imposition of trafficway impact fees which will be used to finance, defray or reimburse the city for all or a portion of the costs of public trafficways which serve such development. The amount of each impact fee shall be calculated based upon the gross square footage of nonresidential development, number of residential dwelling units, type or density or intensity of use, or other appropriate methodology which ensures that the fee is roughly proportional to the impacts of new development on public trafficways. The city assumes responsibility for and will pay for with general city revenues all public trafficway needs for existing development. (Ord. 18273 § 2, 6-22-04. Code 1995 § 130-761.)


12.55.020 Findings.

The city council hereby finds that:

(a) The city assumes the responsibility for and is committed to providing public trafficway at levels necessary to cure any existing deficiencies in already developed areas.

(b) Trafficway impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall not be used to cure existing deficiencies in public trafficways.

(c) New residential and nonresidential development imposes increased and excessive demands upon the city’s public trafficways.

(d) Planning, economic and demographic studies project that new development will continue and will place ever-increasing demands on the city to provide public trafficways to serve the new development.

(e) The development potential and property values of properties in the designated trafficway benefit areas are strongly influenced by city policy as expressed in the comprehensive plan and as implemented by the city zoning ordinance and map.

(f) To the extent that new development in designated trafficway benefit areas places demands upon the public trafficways, those demands should be satisfied by creating a partnership between the development community and the city to provide trafficways funded by the development creating the demands.

(g) Further, the city council recognizes the benefits of new development and wishes to encourage the orderly growth and harmonious development of the city. Consequently, the city council recognizes the benefits of partnering with the development community to improve and pay for trafficway infrastructure serving the new development.

(h) The city council, after careful consideration, and the experience of other similarly situated cities, recognizes that new development requires and places demands on trafficway infrastructure. The city council finds that it is fair and equitable for new development to finance through trafficway impact fees, major trafficways that serve designated trafficway benefit areas.

(i) The city council, after careful consideration and the experience of other similarly situated cities, finds that the imposition of trafficway impact fees to finance specified major public trafficways in designated trafficway benefit areas, the demand for which is created by new development, is in the best interests of the general welfare of the city and its residents, is equitable, and does not impose an unfair burden on new development. (Ord. 18273 § 3, 6-22-04. Code 1995 § 130-762.)


12.55.030 Applicability.

Unless expressly excepted or exempted, this chapter applies to all trafficway impact fees imposed by the city to finance public trafficways attributable to new development. (Ord. 18273 § 4, 6-22-04. Code 1995 § 130-763.)


12.55.040 Effect on other taxes, assessments or fees.

The payment of a trafficway impact fee under this chapter does not relieve a developer or other property owner from paying:

(a) Taxes and special assessments;

(b) Fees for permits or inspections;

(c) Fees for connections to utilities;

(d) Taxes, assessments or fees imposed, levied or collected by other governmental agencies including subdivisions of the state and federal government. (Ord. 18273 § 5, 6-22-04. Code 1995 § 130-764.)

13.05.060 ERU rate.

(a) There is hereby established for purposes of calculating the stormwater drainage fee the equivalent residential unit (ERU). The ERU is hereby established to be 2,018 feet of impervious area.

(b) The ERU rate to be charged for stormwater drainage fees for each ERU is hereby established as follows:

	ERU rates per month:	Feb. 1, 2018	Jan. 1, 2019	Jan. 1, 2020

	Single-family residence:

	Less than 1,500 sq. ft.	$2.92	$3.07	$3.22

	All other residential	$4.50	$4.75	$5.00

	All nonresidential	$4.50	$4.75	$5.00

(c) The following enumerated factors and review process are hereby adopted by the city to evaluate any reductions of stormwater utility fees charged to properties which are located within a duly created drainage district:

(1) Quantify the functional activities and frequency for the activities that are being performed within a drainage district’s boundary within the city’s service area by the city.

(2) Quantify the functional activities and frequency for the activities that are being performed within a drainage district’s boundary within the city’s service area by the drainage district.

(3) If an identical function is being performed by the drainage district and is not replicated by the city within the drainage district’s service area, quantify the specific unit of service, including but not limited to length, cross-section area, surface area, number of structures, rehabilitation activities and the frequency for this performance.

(4) Compare the same function and frequency with the costs appropriate for the city staff to perform an identical activity utilizing the city’s budget for that specific function.

(5) Utilizing the city’s cost for a function and the specific units accomplished in the drainage district’s boundary, extend the unit cost times the units accomplished to obtain the total annual cost for all identical functions.

(6) Utilizing the total costs for all functions provided by the drainage district based upon city unit costs, divide this total cost by the ERUs within the drainage district (divided by 12 to obtain monthly) and obtain a “drainage district ERU equivalent cost.”

(7) For all parcels within the specific drainage district boundary and within the city limits, subject the “drainage district ERU equivalent cost” from the city’s stormwater ERU rate (monthly).

(d) The utilities department is directed to annually review, utilizing the factors and process referenced herein, and determine monetary savings, if any, to the city for stormwater services provided by duly created drainage districts. The utilities department shall report its determination of savings to the stormwater utility, if any, to the governing body by June 15th of each year. Rate reductions for properties within duly created drainage districts shall be adopted by separate ordinance and be based upon savings to the stormwater utility.

(e) Utilizing the enumerated factors and review process adopted herein, the stormwater rate reduction for the following duly created drainage districts is as follows:

	Shunganunga Drainage District    	0

	Kaw River Drainage District    	0

	North Topeka Drainage District (per ERU, per month)    	$0.83

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the utilities director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of Chapters 13.15, 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC. (Ord. 20089 § 36, 10-17-17.)

Article II. Administration and Enforcement


13.15.100 Powers and duties of the utilities director. 

The utilities director shall have the responsibility and authority to ensure compliance with the NPDES permits issued to the city in order to protect the waters of the state of Kansas and the United States.

(a) Specifically, the utilities director is authorized to perform the necessary construction, repair, maintenance and rehabilitation as is necessary in his judgment to ensure the safe and efficient functioning of the POTW system. Additionally, the utilities director shall be responsible for the efficient and safe treatment of all waste at the POTW and the treatment, application or disposal of solid waste. The utilities director shall also have the authority to regulate significant industrial users and the hauling and disposal of liquid waste.

(b) The utilities director is authorized to perform the construction, repair, maintenance and rehabilitation as is necessary in his or her sole judgment to ensure the MS4 system functions safely and efficiently to limit erosion and protect water quality. This authority shall include the authority for bank stabilization and clearing obstructions in natural channels and streams. Additionally, the utilities director shall have the authority to implement drainage correction to alleviate surface water flooding or erosion. The utilities director shall have the authority to regulate construction activities, stream buffer regulation, and excavation. 

(c) The remedies provided for in this code are not exclusive. The utilities director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan. However, the utilities director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the utilities director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (Ord. 20089 § 37, 10-17-17.)


13.15.110 Notice of violation.

(a) Contents of Notice. Whenever the utilities director finds that any user has violated or is violating any provisions set forth in Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC, the utilities director may, in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan, serve notice upon such user which contains the following:

(1) The street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the premises at which the violation is occurring.

(2) A clear statement of violation and code section in violation.

(3) If applicable, notice may contain a statement of the corrective action required to be taken as determined by the utilities director.

(b) Service of Notice. The notice and any amended or supplemental notice shall be served upon the owner of record, and one copy thereof shall be served on each of the following, if applicable, if known or disclosed from official public records: (1) the tenant in possession or (2) the contractor or other individual named in the permit upon which work is being done on the premises. The failure of the utilities director to serve any person required herein to be served shall not invalidate any proceedings hereunder as to any other person duly served or relieve any such person from any duty or obligation imposed by the provisions of this section.

(c) Method of Service. Service of the notice shall be made upon all persons entitled either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each such person at their address as it appears on the register of deeds, Shawnee County records or at the address listed in the permit or under which the work is being done. If the location of such person is unknown or if no address of such person so appears after diligent effort, then copies of such notice shall be mailed by first class mail to the individual at the address of the real property at which the violation is occurring, and a copy of such notice shall be published once in the official city paper. The failure of any such person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this section. Service by certified mail in the manner herein provided shall be effective on the date of receipt. (Ord. 20089 § 38, 10-17-17.)


13.15.120 Enforcement methods. 

The following enforcement methods shall apply to provisions set forth in Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC.

(a) Abatement of Nuisance. Once the property owner has been given notice and opportunity to correct the violations and then failed to do so, the city shall be authorized to abate the violation in accordance with K.S.A. 12-1617e, as amended, which may result in a service assessment and lien imposed pursuant to TMC 3.45.090 et seq. or K.S.A. 12-6a17 and amendments thereto.

(b) Emergency Provisions.

(1) Immediate Abatement. The utilities director is authorized to require immediate abatement of any violation of the provisions set forth in Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC that constitutes an immediate threat to the health, safety or well-being of the public. If any such violation is not abated immediately as directed by the utilities director, the city may abate the violation. Any costs of abating incurred by the city shall be fully reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible party. Any relief obtained under this section shall not prevent the city from seeking other and further relief authorized under this article.

(2) Emergency Shut-Off Water. In addition to any other remedies available under this article, the utilities director shall be authorized to order the shut-off of water to the property to eliminate an immediate threat to the health, safety, or well-being of the public.

(3) Placarding. Whenever the utilities director determines that there has been a violation of any provisions set forth at Chapter 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 or 13.35 TMC or has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred that is an immediate threat to the health, safety, or well-being of the public, the utilities director shall have the authority to order the immediate removal of persons from their property and shall give notice to the owner or the person or persons responsible therefor in the manner prescribed below. Such written notice shall contain the following:

(i) The street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the premises at which the violation is occurring.

(ii) A clear statement of violation and code section in violation.

(iii) If applicable, notice may contain a statement of the corrective action required to be taken as determined by the utilities director.

(4) Stop Work Order.

(i) Authority. Whenever the utilities director finds any construction activity being performed is either in violation of the provisions set forth in Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC, applicable permit, or is dangerous or unsafe, the utilities director is authorized to issue a stop work order.

(ii) Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent, or to the person doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order, and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.

(iii) Unlawful Continuance. It shall be unlawful for any person to continue to work after having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition.

(5) Injunctions. Whenever a violation of the provisions set forth in Chapter 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 or 13.35 TMC causes or threatens to cause a condition of contamination, pollution or nuisance, the utilities director may petition the district court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such violation. 

(6) Injunctive Relief. When the utilities director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utilities director may petition the district court through the city attorney or such other attorney engaged by the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The utilities director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

(7) Administrative Orders. The utilities director may issue an order directing a user to take certain action to resolve any violations. Orders may contain any requirements reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the installation of treatment technology, conducting additional self-monitoring and implementing best management practices. Orders may include a consent order, compliance order, show cause order, or a cease and desist order. 

(8) The utilities director shall annually publish in the official city newspaper or such other official city publication a list of the industrial users that were in significant noncompliance of any pretreatment requirements or standards, during the previous calendar year. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against an industrial user, by the city, during the same 12 months. (Ord. 20089 § 39, 10-17-17.)


13.15.130 Administrative search warrants.

If the utilities director has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and if the utilities director has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of the provisions set forth in Chapter 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 or 13.35 TMC or that there is a need to inspect the property to verify compliance with the provisions of Chapter 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 or 13.35 TMC or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then, upon application to a district court judge, the utilities director shall obtain an administrative search warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the administrative warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the utilities director. (Ord. 20089 § 40, 10-17-17.)


13.15.140 Administrative monetary penalties.

When the utilities director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utilities director may impose on such user an amount not to exceed the maximum penalty as outlined below. Such administrative monetary penalties shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, administrative monetary penalties shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. The utilities director shall have the authority to impose the following administrative monetary penalties:

(a) The following administrative monetary penalty shall apply to violations of the provisions relating to construction activity, erosion and sediment control and stormwater management practices in Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC:

(1) Fifty dollars per violation for a first violation.

(2) One hundred dollars per violation for a second violation within a continuous 12-month period of the first violation.

(3) Two hundred dollars per violation for a third or subsequent violation within a continuous 12-month period of the two previous violations.

(b) The following administrative monetary penalty shall apply to violations of the provisions relating to the introduction of industrial or hazardous waste into the POTW:

(1) One hundred dollars per violation for a first violation.

(2) Five hundred dollars per violation for a second violation within a continuous 12-month period of the first violation.

(3) One thousand dollars per violation for a third or subsequent violation within a continuous 12-month period of the two previous violations. 

(c) Notwithstanding the forgoing, the utilities director shall have the authority to impose an administrative monetary penalty of up to $1,000 for a single violation which materially inhibits or disrupts the POTW or causes it to violate a requirement under its NPDES permit. (Ord. 20089 § 41, 10-17-17.)


13.15.150 Criminal prosecution.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provisions of Chapter 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 or 13.35 TMC.

(b) Any person violating this section may be punished by:

(1) A fine of not more than $499.00;

(2) Imprisonment in jail for not more than 179 days; or

(3) Both such fine and imprisonment not to exceed these limits. (Ord. 19625 § 9, 8-23-11.)


13.15.160 Appeal.

Appeals from notices of violation and administrative hearings shall be in accordance with the administrative appeal procedure set forth in Chapter 2.145 TMC. (Ord. 19496 § 16, 12-21-10.)

Article I. Sewer Construction and Connections


13.20.100 Connection required – Enforcement.

(a) It shall be the duty of every person owning any dwelling house or any other building within the city to make connections with the public sanitary sewer for the purpose of disposing of all substances from any such building, affecting the public health which may be lawfully and properly disposed of by means of such sewer. Connection with the public sanitary sewer is required when the main or lateral sewer is adjacent to the property and one or more of the following conditions exist:

(1) The septic system serving the property constitutes a public nuisance. The utilities director for the city is hereby designated to determine when a septic system is a public nuisance; and/or

(2) The property changes ownership; and/or

(3) Modifications are made to the main structure located on the property that requires issuance of a building permit; and/or

(4) Within five years of the construction of the public main or lateral sanitary sewer, such time not starting any sooner than the effective date of this chapter.

(b) Failure to Connect/Service Assessment. If any person shall fail, neglect or refuse to connect any such building with the sewer system as provided by this article for more than 30 calendar days or in the case of public nuisance for more than 10 days after being notified in writing by the department of public works or their designee to do so, the city may advertise for bids for the construction and make contracts therefor to the lowest responsible bidder and may cause such buildings or premises to be connected with the sewer system and may assess the cost of expense including any applicable connection fees thereof against the property and premises so connected, such assessment to be made in the same manner as other special assessments are made. The city and its designated representatives shall have the right of entry onto properties for the purposes set forth in this article.

(c) Extension of Time to Connect. The city manager may extend the time to make connection with the public sanitary sewer if city administered loan money for qualifying property owners is not available at the written request of the person owning the dwelling or other building and the requester is a qualified property owner. (Ord. 20089 § 42, 10-17-17.)

    Cross References: Public works department, TMC 2.30.110.


13.20.110 Defective private service line or septic system.

It shall be unlawful to permit or allow the leakage of water, sewage or other matter from a private service line, septic system including septic tank, piping, or lateral line, or onto private or public property thereby creating unhealthy conditions that constitute an immediate threat to the health, safety, or well-being of the public. (Ord. 19496 § 32, 12-21-10.)


13.20.120 Size, location, plans.

The utilities director shall have the city engineer or other engineer lay out and determine the size, location and grade, and make all necessary plans, specifications, requirements and estimates, for all sewers within the main sewer districts and sewer subdistricts heretofore designated or hereafter created and designated and file the same in the engineer’s office for the use of the city, and at the expiration of the term of office deliver the same intact to the successor. When the city engineer or other engineer does not have sufficient staff or the improvement is of such nature as to require special knowledge or experience, the utilities director may enter into a contract with consulting engineers for the engineering work, such work to be approved by the city engineer or other engineer. (Ord. 20089 § 43, 10-17-17.)

    Cross References: City engineer, TMC 2.30.110.


13.20.130 Permit – Required.

(a) No sewer or drain of any kind shall be connected with the sewers constructed under authority of the city within any of the main sewer districts or sewer subdistricts of the city, except by written permission of the city engineer and by compliance with all the rules, regulations and specifications provided for the proper construction and maintenance of such sewers or drains.

(b) Any person owning property within the city limits, which property is not within any lateral sanitary sewer district theretofore created, desiring to make connection to the sanitary sewage system, shall make application for a permit to the utilities department. (Ord. 20089 § 44, 10-17-17.)

    Cross References: City engineer, TMC 2.30.110.


13.20.140 Permit – Conditions.

All permits granted under this article shall expressly state that the applicant, and any grantees, devisees, heirs, administrators and assigns, agree and consent that the property covered in the permit may thereafter be included in any sanitary sewage district whenever created in accordance with law. (Ord. 19496 § 35, 12-21-10; Ord. 16388 § 5.4, 11-5-91. Code 1995 § 146-239. Formerly 14.80.230.)


13.20.150 Sanitary sewer failures and repair responsibilities.

(a) The maintenance and repair of a building service line and its connection with the city sewer main is the responsibility of the owner of the property it serves. It is therefore the responsibility of the property owner to make repairs if there is a failure in the building service line or the wye connection to the city sewer main and the responsibility of the city if there is a failure in the city sewer main. The first indication of sewer failure or potential failure may vary. It is the intention of the water pollution control division to cooperate with the individual property owners and the plumbers in the resolution of these sanitary failures within the following guidelines.

(b) Sewer Failure – Excavation.

(1) Settlement of Ground Surface. In some cases failure of a sewer line is first indicated by settlement of the ground surface near a failure. This can happen before there is any apparent malfunction in either the building service line or the city sewer main. When this occurs over or near the connection of the building service line to the city sewer main, it is not always possible to determine before excavation whether the failure is in the building service line, the city sewer main, or both. If there is no indication at this time that the building service line has failed, the water pollution control division will make an attempt to determine the problem by inspection of the city sewer main. If the problem is with the city sewer main, or if the city is unable to inspect the city sewer, the division will make the initial excavation to determine the source of the problem.

(2) Sewer Stoppage/Backup. If the backup of sewage is the first indication of failure, the water pollution control division will assist by investigating to determine if there is a stoppage in the city sewer main.

(i) If the city sewer main has deteriorated to the point where it appears to be the source of the problem or if the city sewer main contains a stoppage that cannot be removed by conventional methods, then the water pollution control division will make the initial excavation to determine the extent of the failure.

(ii) If the city sewer main is not obstructed, but is open and flowing, and the private sewer line has failed, it then becomes the responsibility of the property owner to make the necessary repairs within seven days. In this case, the water pollution control division will not make the initial excavation.

(3) Excavation Requirement. It shall be the total responsibility of the party making the excavation to make it of adequate size for water pollution control division personnel to work safely for inspection of the sewer and/or repairing of the wye connection.

(c) Sewer Repairs.

(1) City Sewer Is Broken. If the city sewer main is broken or in such poor condition that it is impractical to make a new wye connection (except where the city sewer main was broken during excavation by others), then the water pollution control division will provide the following services:

(i) Make the additional excavation required to remove the damaged pipe and replace the broken section(s) of pipe.

(ii) Install a new wye connection thereto and pour a concrete base under the city sewer or provide adequate support.

(iii) If the material removed from the hole is unacceptable for backfilling, the water pollution control division will furnish new backfill material.

(iv) Haul off any excess dirt or other material unacceptable for backfill.

(v) Remove any debris left on city property.

(vi) Replace the surfacing.

(vii) If the initial excavation was made by the property owner(s), the water pollution control division may share in the cost, depending upon the reason for the initial excavation.

(2) Broken Wye. If the wye connection itself is broken at the city sewer main, the private sewer line has also failed and the city sewer is in good condition, the water pollution control division will also haul off any excess dirt or other material unacceptable for backfill and remove any debris left on city property. The water pollution control division may participate in the cost of additional items of work where the cost is excessive due to surfacing or deep sewers. It is the responsibility of the property owner(s) to hire a plumber to install the private sewer line(s), replace the backfill material and compact it in accordance with engineering department standards.

(3) City Sewer Intact.

(i) If the city sewer main and the wye connection itself are intact and only the private sewer line(s) is damaged, the water pollution control division has no responsibility and therefore will not assist in or pay for any portion of the repair work. In such cases, the utilities director or designee shall direct the property owner, from which the building service line extends, to repair the service line within seven days.

(ii) The property owner may, through written request, authorize the water pollution control division to cause the private sewer line to be repaired and reimburse the water pollution control division for any cost and expenses incurred therewith.

(iii) The water pollution control division shall exercise diligence, including sending a certified letter, return receipt requested, in attempting to locate and direct the property owner to repair the service line. However, if said property owner cannot be located or if said property owner fails to secure the service of a contractor to repair the private sewer service line within 72 hours of having received notice from the utilities director, then the water pollution control division may cause the private sewer line, situated in the public right-of-way, to be repaired and excavation backfilled. The said property owner shall be responsible for any cost and expenses incurred in connection with said repair.

(iv) The water pollution control division shall submit a bill to the owner of any property for which it caused a private sewer line to be repaired. In the event the owner of any property for which the water pollution control division has caused replacement or repair of a private sewer service line shall neglect, fail or refuse to pay the cost or expenses incurred by the water pollution control division, such charges shall constitute a lien upon the real estate from which the private sewer line extends, and shall be certified by the city clerk to the county clerk, to be placed on the tax roll for collection, subject to the same penalties and collected in like manner as other taxes are by law collectable.

(v) The officials of the utilities department shall be authorized to inspect any sewer repair work done in public right-of-way or easement pursuant to the provisions of this section. (Ord. 20089 § 45, 10-17-17.)

    Cross References: City clerk, TMC 2.30.010.


13.20.160 Settling, collapse of public ways due to faulty sewer installation – Repairs – Costs.

(a) Whenever officials of the city’s utilities department investigate any localized settlements or collapses in public streets, easements, alleys or rights-of-way and determine that such settlement or collapse has occurred due to inadequacies of a public sewer line, then the water pollution control division may make or cause to be made immediate repairs and backfill the excavation. However, if the settlement or collapse is found to have resulted from inadequacies in a private sewer line, then the utilities director or designee shall direct the property owner from which the building service line extends to repair the service line within seven days.

(b) The property owner may, through written request, authorize the water pollution control division to cause a private sewer line to be repaired and reimburse the water pollution control division for any cost and expenses incurred therewith.

(c) The water pollution control division shall exercise diligence, including sending a certified letter, return receipt requested, in attempting to locate and direct the property owner to repair the service line. However, if such property owner cannot be located or if such property owner fails to secure the service of a contractor to repair the private sewer service line within 72 hours of having received notice from the utilities director, then the water pollution control division may cause the private sewer line situated in the public right-of-way to be repaired and excavation backfilled. The property owner shall be responsible for any cost and expenses incurred in connection with such repair.

(d) The water pollution control division shall submit a bill to the owner of any property for which it caused a private sewer line to be repaired. If the owner of any property for which the water pollution control division has caused placement or repair of a private sewer service line shall neglect, fail or refuse to pay the cost or expenses incurred by the water pollution control division, such charges shall constitute a lien upon the real estate from which the private sewer line extends, and shall be certified by the city clerk to the county clerk, to be placed on the tax roll for collection, subject to the same penalties and collected in like manner as other taxes are by law collectable.

(e) The officials of the utilities department shall be authorized to inspect any sewer repair work done in public rights-of-way or easements pursuant to the provisions of this section. (Ord. 20089 § 46, 10-17-17.)

(a) Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge and/or slug loads of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter. Users shall submit oral notice to the water pollution control division immediately from the time the user becomes aware of the accidental discharge, slug discharge or treatment bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain:

(1) A description of the accidental discharge, slug load or treatment bypass and its cause;

(2) The exact date and time of the accidental discharge, slug load or treatment bypass;

(3) The exact date and time of correction and volume of the accidental discharge, slug load or treatment bypass;

(4) If the accidental discharge, slug load or treatment bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and

(5) Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the accidental discharge, slug load or treatment bypass.

(b) The notification required by this section will not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss or damage to the sewer system, treatment plant or treatment process, or for any fines imposed on the water pollution control division on account thereof by any public, state or federal agency.

(c) The water pollution control division may issue various notices and information directed towards more effective water pollution control. Such notices and information shall be made available to employees of the user for their information and to solicit their cooperation. A notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board advising employees whom to call in case of an accidental discharge in violation of this chapter.

(d) Any possible connection or entry point for a persistent or deleterious substance to be discharged to the user’s plumbing or drainage system shall be appropriately labeled to warn operating personnel against discharge of such substance in violation of this chapter.

(e) In any case where an industrial user knows in advance of the need to bypass and/or discharge a slug load, it shall submit prior notice to the utilities director at least 10 days before the date of bypass and/or discharge of a slug load. Such notice shall include information which identifies the time and date of the start and stop of the discharge, the estimated volume of the discharge, as well as any proposed primary treatment to be applied to the discharge.

(f) Upon the request of the utilities director, any industrial user may be required to submit to the division of water pollution control a slug control plan. The plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:

(1) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

Trade secrets which must be divulged by the user for the effective implementation of this chapter may be submitted separately from any other information required under this chapter, and, if so submitted, shall be captioned by the user, “TRADE SECRET.” Trade secrets shall be maintained by the division in a locked and secure manner. It shall be the division’s responsibility to establish a system of limited access to trade secrets so as to eliminate the possibility of public disclosure.

(b) No person while an official or employee of the city, or thereafter, shall use to their own advantage, or reveal, other than to the authorized representatives of the United States government, the state, or other government, in their official capacity, or as ordered by a court in a judicial proceeding, any information acquired under the authority of this chapter concerning any matter which is entitled to protection as a trade secret. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential or subject to the trade secret limitations. (Ord. 19496 § 72, 12-21-10; Ord. 16388 § 8.10, 11-5-91. Code 1995 § 146-311. Formerly 14.80.600.)


13.20.520 Reporting requirements.

(a) Baseline Monitoring Report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a categorical determination, industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit a report which contains the following information:

(1) Identifying information including the name and address of the facility with the name of the operators and owners.

(2) A list of environmental control permits held by the user.

(3) A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification carried out by the user.

(4) Flow measurements showing the measured average and maximum daily flow.

(6) Certification statement reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user as outlined in 40 CFR 403.12(l).

(7) Compliance schedule if additional pretreatment and/or operations and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards.

(8) Such report shall also contain a certification statement signed by an authorized representative.

(b) Ninety-Day Compliance Report. Within 90 days following the date of final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater to the POTW, any user subject to the pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the utilities director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for the process units in the user’s facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards and requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, what additional operations and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. Such report shall also contain a certification statement signed by an authorized representative.

(c) Periodic Compliance Reports.

(1) Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge of waste to the POTW, shall submit to the utilities director reports as required by the permit. Such reports shall also contain a certification statement signed by an authorized representative. In no case will the report cover a period in excess of six months for categorical industries.

(2) Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the water pollution control division at least once every six months a description of the nature, concentration and flow of the pollutants required to be reported in accordance with the wastewater treatment discharge permit issued.

(3) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with TMC 13.20.525.

(d) Monitoring and Sampling Requirements.

(1) The monitoring reports required in subsection (c) of this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration or mass limitations, where requested by the utilities director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the utilities director, in lieu of the industrial user. Where the utilities director performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the industrial user will not be required to submit the compliance certification required in the baseline monitoring and 90-day reports, required in 40 CFR 403.12. In addition, where the utilities director collects all the information required for these reports, including flow data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the same information.

(2) If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the utilities director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the utilities director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. However, the industrial user is not required to resample if:

(i) The utilities director performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or

(ii) The utilities director performs sampling at the industrial user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.

(3) The monitoring reports submitted to the utilities director shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis, performed during the period identified in the permit and shall be representative of discharge occurring during the reporting period. The utilities director shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by the industrial user, with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(4) All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the EPA in accordance with 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the EPA. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the utilities director or other parties approved by EPA.

(5) If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the utilities director and uses approved wastewater sampling and analytical methods, the results of this monitoring shall be included in their monitoring report.

(e) Sample Collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report and based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.

(1) Except as indicated in subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the utilities director. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the utilities director, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the utilities director, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.

(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsections (a) and (b) of this section (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the utilities director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(f) Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the utilities director of any significant changes to the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or 10 percent change in the volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before its introduction.

(g) Reports of Potential Problems.

(1) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the utilities director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.

(2) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the utilities director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.

(3) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (g)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(4) Significant industrial users are required to notify the utilities director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

(h) Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in TMC 13.20.450.

(i) Compliance Schedule Progress Report. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by TMC 13.20.450:

(1) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);

(2) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;

(3) The user shall submit a progress report to the utilities director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and

(4) In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the utilities director. (Ord. 20089 § 73, 10-17-17.)


13.20.525 Certification statements.

Certification of Permit Applications and User Reports. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with TMC 13.20.430, users submitting baseline monitoring reports and periodic compliance reports under TMC 13.20.520. The following certification statement must be signed by an authorized representative:

I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

(Ord. 20089 § 74, 10-17-17.)


13.20.530 Notice of hazardous waste discharge.

(a) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self monitoring requirements of this section.

(b) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.

(c) In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the utilities director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.

(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

(e) This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by Chapters 13.20, 13.25, 13.30 and 13.35 TMC, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. (Ord. 20089 § 75, 10-17-17.)


13.20.540 Significant noncompliance.

It shall be unlawful for any industrial user to be in significant noncompliance with the pretreatment requirements set forth in this article. An industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:

(a) Chronic Violations. Sixty-six percent or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a six-month period (any magnitude of exceedance).

(b) Technical Review Criteria or “TRC” Violations. Thirty-three percent or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit by more than the TRC in a six-month period.

There are two groups of TRCs: BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, where the TRC is 1.4; and group II for all other pollutants, where the TRC is 1.2 except pH. No TRC will be used for pH.

(c) Any other violation of an effluent limit (average or daily maximum) that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference (e.g., slug loads) or pass-through; or endangered the health of the sewage treatment personnel or the public.

(d) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health/welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the POTW’s exercise of its emergency authority, as found in the ERP, to halt or prevent such a discharge.

(e) Violations of compliance schedule milestones, contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order, for starting construction, completing construction, and attaining final compliance by 90 days or more after the schedule date.

(f) Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-monitoring data, or categorical standards (baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, and periodic reports) within 30 days from the due date.

(g) Failure to accurately report noncompliance.

(h) Any other violation or group of violations that the utilities director considers to be significant. (Ord. 20089 § 76, 10-17-17.)


13.20.545 Upset.

(a) For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

(b) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met.

(c) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

(3) The user has submitted the following information to the utilities director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:

(i) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;

(ii) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

(iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

(d) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

(e) Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.

(f) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 20089 § 77, 10-17-17.)


13.20.550 Record keeping.

Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this title, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs established under TMC 13.20.300. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.

Article VI. Sewage Connection and Disposal Charges


13.20.680 Connection fees and monthly rates/charges established.

(a) Rates and charges for sewer maintenance, sewage transportation, and sewage treatment shall be established by ordinance in amounts sufficient to pay costs and expenses of the following three general classifications:

(1) Sewage disposal and treatment; and

(2) Sewage transportation; and

(3) Sewer operation and maintenance.

All such rates shall be reviewed at least every five years or more frequently at the discretion of the city, except rates for sewage disposal and treatment, which rates shall be reviewed, altered, or amended as other rates within the city limits.

(b) At the discretion of the city manager or governing body, the connection fees listed in this section may be waived for economic development projects which, due to their unusual nature or magnitude, offer extraordinary benefits to the community. The city manager may waive up to 25 percent of the fees. Governing body approval shall be required for approval for any waiver in excess of 25 percent.

(c) The utilities director shall determine the system connection fee for each consumer making application for a new service connection. The system connection fee shall be paid prior to connection as part of the application process. Such system connection fees shall be based on the system’s value, total capacity, and associated water meter size. Applications for sewer connections for which there is no associated water service application shall have a sewer connection fee which is calculated on the basis of projected flows from other sources approximating the water service size. System connection fees are in addition to other rates, charges, deposits, or fees established by law. The system connection fees for all classifications and meter sizes shall be paid prior to connection. These fees shall include all materials and labor by city personnel.

The system connection fees for meters larger than eight inches shall be determined by the utilities director based on projected flows. (Ord. 20089 § 89, 10-17-17.)

    Cross References: City council – mayor, Chapter 2.15 TMC.


13.20.690 Calculation of charges and classification of users.

All industrial users shall be classified by assigning each one to a standard classification category according to the principal activity conducted on the premises. The purpose of such classification is to facilitate the regulation of wastewater discharges based on quality, quantity, and rate of flow to provide an effective means of source control, and to establish a system of wastewater service charges and fees which will ensure an equitable recovery of the city’s cost. The elements of quality may include but are not limited to the following: suspended solids, BOD, COD, oil and grease, and chlorine demand. (Ord. 19496 § 90, 12-21-10; Ord. 18272 § 8, 6-22-04; Code 1981 § 44-296. Code 1995 § 146-342. Formerly 14.80.780.)


13.20.700 Standard classification charges.

(a) For the purpose of calculating wastewater service charges, the minimum standard classification charge shall be based upon the average strength of domestic wastewater, and for this purpose the average strength of domestic wastewater is hereby defined as containing not more than the following:

Three hundred mg/l suspended solids (SS);

Four hundred mg/l chemical oxygen demand (COD);

Three hundred mg/l biochemical oxygen demand (BOD);

Fifty mg/l oil and grease (O&G) (animal or vegetable origin);

Ten mg/l phosphorous (P);

Thirty mg/l Kjeldahl nitrogen;

Seven hundred mg/l total solids (TS);

Additional elements of wastewater strength as may be deemed necessary by the director.

(b) Any person desiring to discharge wastewater to the city sewage collection system having a concentration greater than 300 mg/l suspended solids or 300 mg/l biochemical oxygen demand shall receive written permission from the director before allowing such discharge. (Ord. 19496 § 91, 12-21-10; Ord. 18272 § 9, 6-22-04. Code 1995 § 146-343. Formerly 14.80.790.)


13.20.710 Treatment of liquid waste – Setting of rate.

The utilities director shall have the authority to accept liquid waste for treatment at the plant and to establish the rate for treatment of any class of liquid waste. The utilities director shall take certain factors into consideration in setting the rates for treatment of liquid waste including, but not limited to, surcharge rate, documented waste strength, special treatment requirements, special handling and administrative costs. Nothing contained herein shall limit the utilities director’s ability to refuse to accept any liquid waste for treatment. (Ord. 20089 § 90, 10-17-17.)


13.20.720 Special treatment conditions.

Any stronger sewage or sewage objectionable because of interference with the normal biological treatment processes of the plant is subject to acceptance by the utilities director upon terms worked out between the city and the proposed customer seeking an outlet for strong sewage wastes. (Ord. 20089 § 91, 10-17-17.)


13.20.730 Special metering conditions.

(a) Whenever, due to unusual conditions, the amount of water consumed and the amount of wastewater generated are significantly different, the owners of any property served by the wastewater collection system may make application to the water pollution control division to have their wastewater service charge calculated on the basis of wastewater generated in lieu of the volume of water consumed. This amount must be determined by one of the following methods:

(1) Actual measurement of the wastewater discharged to the city sewer.

(2) Measurement by a water meter of the water consumed that is discharged to the sanitary sewer.

(3) Measurement by water meter of the water consumed that is not ultimately discharged to the sanitary sewer. The wastewater service charge shall then be based on the difference between the total water consumed and the amount not discharged to the sanitary sewer.

(b) Water that is used in a single-pass air conditioning cooling tower (no recirculation of cooling water) may be discharged to the storm sewer system. All water used in this method and disposed of in the storm sewer may be deducted from the water consumed to obtain a volume on which to charge wastewater service charges.

(c) Water that is used in a recirculating type air conditioning cooling tower may be deducted from the water consumed; provided, that the amount of blow-down discharged to the sanitary sewer is measured or reasonably estimated and is not deducted from the water consumption, to determine the wastewater service charge.

(d) All costs associated with the installation and maintenance of metering facilities shall be the responsibility of the customer desiring the adjustment. Responsibility for obtaining and reporting monthly or bimonthly meter readings, on a form supplied by the water pollution control division, will be the responsibility of the customer. Failure to report meter readings will be justification for eliminating the credit for water consumed but not discharged to the sanitary sewer.

(e) The water pollution control division will make an annual inspection of each metering facility to determine its suitability and the correctness of the meter reading.

(f) Contracts that were in effect at the time this section became effective will be allowed to expire. Exemption for water consumed but not discharged to the sanitary sewer, after the expiration date of the contract, will not be allowed except as measured in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. (Ord. 19496 § 94, 12-21-10; Code 1981 § 44-299.1. Code 1995 § 146-345. Formerly 14.80.810.)


13.20.740 Rendering of bills.

The customer services office of the utilities department shall render bills monthly to all persons whose premises are connected to the sanitary sewer system of the city. The customer service office shall not assume responsibility for speedy and safe delivery or the failure to receive such bills. A duplicate may be obtained by calling in person at the customer service office or by telephoning the office requesting a duplicate bill. (Ord. 20089 § 92, 10-17-17.)


13.20.750 Effective date for charges.

(a) The sewage service charge fixed by this article shall become effective with the first billing date for city water services. The following time schedule within a billing period shall determine the proportional part of the monthly or bimonthly rate that shall apply:

	Length of service	Monthly percent	Bimonthly percent

	0 – 7 days	0	0

	8 – 15 days	50	25

	16 – 30 days	100	50

	31 – 45 days	–	75

	46 – 60 days	–	100

(b) All persons whose premises are connected to the sanitary sewer during the time they receive water service shall pay a sewer service charge in accordance with the above schedule. (Ord. 19496 § 96, 12-21-10; Code 1981 § 44-301. Code 1995 § 146-347. Formerly 14.80.830.)


13.20.760 Payment required – No discrimination.

No person shall be allowed the use of the sanitary sewers of the city without the payment of the sewage service charge, nor shall there be any discrimination among users of like classes as to rates. (Ord. 19496 § 97, 12-21-10; Code 1981 § 44-302. Code 1995 § 146-348. Formerly 14.80.840.)


13.20.770 Sewage disposal system fund.

(a) All amounts billed and collected for sewage service charged by the department of finance and revenue shall be segregated in a separate account designated as the sewage disposal system fund. This fund shall be used only for the purpose of paying the costs of the operation, maintenance and administration of the sewage treatment system of the city, for providing an adequate depreciation fund, and for paying the principal and interest of the revenue bonds issued and principal and interest of general obligation bonds now outstanding, which have heretofore been issued against the sewage treatment plant, as and when the principal and interest become due and payable according to the terms and conditions of the outstanding bonds.

(b) If there shall be any balance remaining in the fund after payment of the items provided in this section, then the balance may be used to pay the cost of extending and improving the sewage treatment system; provided, that there has been set aside therefrom an amount sufficient to pay one year’s principal and interest on the revenue bonds issued under this chapter in addition to the current year’s principal and interest. (Ord. 19496 § 98, 12-21-10; Code 1981 § 44-303. Code 1995 § 146-349. Formerly 14.80.850.)


13.20.780 Certification of names of water users without sewage connection.

The utilities director shall compile a list, at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the sewage service charges fixed by this article, the names of all water users who do not have connections with sanitary sewers, and shall certify monthly thereafter the names of all persons who become users, whose premises are connected with a sanitary sewer system. (Ord. 20089 § 93, 10-17-17.)


13.20.790 Failure to pay bill.

If a sanitary sewer account becomes delinquent, water service may be discontinued and shut off pursuant to K.S.A. 12-860, as may be amended. (Ord. 19496 § 100, 12-21-10; Ord. 19370 § 100, 3-23-10. Code 1995 § 146-351. Formerly 14.80.870.)


13.20.800 Charges for restoring service.

If water service shall be discontinued under authority of this article, the water service shall not be restored until all bills have been paid and a delinquent service fee, as provided for in TMC 13.10.560, has been paid by the person whose water service has been turned off. Such delinquent service fee is to be retained by the water division; provided, that the water pollution control division shall be responsible for remitting the appropriate fee to the water department if not collected from the person. (Ord. 19496 § 101, 12-21-10; Ord. 19370 § 101, 3-23-10. Code 1995 § 146-352. Formerly 14.80.880.)

Article I. Generally


13.25.010 General.

The Federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq., requires certain political entities, such as the city, to implement stormwater management programs within prescribed timeframes.

The Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq., has published rules for stormwater outfall permits. The state has adopted stormwater management legislation which encourages proper management of stormwater runoff and water quality.

The city desires to develop a stormwater utility to be responsible for the operation, construction and maintenance of stormwater devices; for stormwater system planning and for review of development plans for compliance with stormwater management codes.

The cost of operating and maintaining all stormwater management systems and the financing of existing and future necessary repairs, replacements, improvements, and extensions thereof, should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the benefits enjoyed and services received therefrom.

The city has determined that the adoption of this chapter, and the creation of a stormwater utility, under the terms, conditions and criteria set forth hereunder, is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens, residents and inhabitants of the city. (Ord. 19496 § 117, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 13, 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-376. Formerly 14.85.010.)


13.25.020 Statement of intent.

The city declares its intention to be responsible for the operation, construction, maintenance and repair of stormwater system facilities and for stormwater system planning and management. (Ord. 19496 § 118, 12-21-10; Ord. 17985 § 3, 3-25-03; Ord. 17059 § 14, 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-377. Formerly 14.85.020.)


13.25.030 Findings, determinations and powers.

It is hereby found, determined and declared that those elements of the system which provide for the collection, treatment, storage and disposal of stormwater are of benefit and provide services to all property within the incorporated city limits, including property not presently served by the storm elements of the system. The beneficiaries of the system include all real properties within the city which benefit by the provision, operation and improvement of the system. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, the provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of stormwater; the reduction of hazards to property and life resulting from stormwater runoff; improvements in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable stormwater conditions; and improvements to the water quality in the stormwater and surface water system and its receiving waters. The utility, under the direction of the director thereof, shall have the power to:

(a) Administer the acquisition, design, construction, maintenance and operation of the utility system, including capital improvements designated in the capital improvement program;

(b) Administer and enforce this chapter and all regulations and procedures adopted relating to the design, construction, maintenance, operation and alteration of the utility system including, but not limited to, the quantity, quality and/or velocity of the stormwater conveyed thereby;

(c) Review private systems as necessary to determine the compliance of such systems with this chapter;

(d) Advise the mayor, city council, city manager and other city departments on matters relating to the utility;

(e) Prepare and revise a comprehensive drainage plan for adoption by the city council periodically;

(f) Review plans and approve or deny, inspect and accept extensions and connections to the system;

(g) Enforce regulations to protect and maintain water quality within the system in compliance with water quality standards established by state, regional and/or federal agencies as now adopted or hereafter amended;

(h) Analyze the cost of services and benefits provided, and the system and structure of fees, charges, fines and other revenues of the utility annually. (Ord. 19496 § 119, 12-21-10; Ord. 18477 § 26, 7-12-05; Ord. 17059 § 16, 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-379. Formerly 14.85.040.)

    Cross References: City council – mayor, Chapter 2.15 TMC; utilities department, TMC 2.30.120.


13.25.040 Operating budget.

The city shall adopt an operating budget for each fiscal year. The operating budget shall set forth for such fiscal year the estimated revenues and the estimated costs for operations and maintenance, extension and replacement and debt service. (Ord. 19496 § 120, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 13, 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-380. Formerly 14.85.050.)

Article II. Stormwater Drainage Fee


13.25.050 Fee established.

Subject to the provisions of this chapter, there is hereby imposed on each and every residential developed property and nonresidential developed property, other than exempt property, and the owners and nonowner users thereof, a stormwater drainage fee. In the event the owner and nonowner users of a particular developed property are not the same, the liability for each the owner and nonowner user for the drainage fee attributable to that developed property shall be joint and several. The drainage fee shall be a monthly service charge and shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter and the ERU and ERU rate. (Ord. 19496 § 121, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 18(A), 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-396. Formerly 14.85.060.)


13.25.060 Fee for residential developed property.

The drainage fee for residential developed property shall be the ERU rate multiplied by the number of individual dwelling units existing on the property. In the event of a newly constructed dwelling unit, the charge for the drainage fee attributable to that dwelling unit shall commence upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for that dwelling unit or final inspection by the division of building inspection or the commencement of water service, or in the event construction has been halted, then on the date the director or director’s designee determines in his reasonable judgment that the impervious area of such development is substantially established. (Ord. 19496 § 122, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 18(B), 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-397. Formerly 14.85.070.)

    Cross References: Utilities department, TMC 2.30.120.


13.25.070 Fee for nonresidential developed property.

(a) The drainage fee for nonresidential developed property shall be the ERU rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of a nonresidential developed property by the number of square feet in one ERU. The minimum drainage fee for any nonresidential developed property shall be equal to one ERU rate.

(b) In the event of newly developed nonresidential development property, the charge for the drainage fee attributable to that development shall commence, or increase in the case of additional development to property which is already developed property, upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for such additional development, or in the event that no certificate of occupancy will be issued for that development, or in the event development has halted, then on the date the director or the director’s designee determines in his reasonable judgment that the impervious area of such development is substantially established.

(c) In the event of separately metered nonresidential developed property with joint users of common impervious areas, the director shall calculate and allocate the pro rata drainage fee among the users. Any owner or nonowner user disagreeing with the director’s calculation or allocation may appeal such determination as provided in this article. (Ord. 19496 § 123, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 18(C), 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-398. Formerly 14.85.080.)

    Cross References: Utilities department, TMC 2.30.120.


13.25.080 Dwelling unit and impervious surface calculation – Generally.

The director or director’s designee shall initially, and thereafter as deemed reasonably necessary, determine the number of dwelling units located on residential developed property in order to establish the drainage fee provided by this article. Nonresidential real property in the city shall have its square footage impervious area calculated in order to establish the drainage fee provided in this article. The director or director’s designee shall make the calculation from such information and data deemed pertinent by the director or director’s designee. (Ord. 19496 § 124, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 18(D), 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-399. Formerly 14.85.090.)

    Cross References: Utilities department, TMC 2.30.120.


13.25.090 Dwelling unit and impervious surface calculation – Appeal.

Any person disagreeing with the calculation of the stormwater drainage fee, as provided in this article, or seeking a stormwater drainage fee adjustment based upon stormwater management practices, may appeal such fee determination to the director within 30 days from the date of the last bill containing stormwater drainage fee charges. Any appeal shall be filed in writing and shall include a survey prepared by a land surveyor showing dwelling units, total property area, impervious area or nonresidential developed area, as appropriate, and a depiction of the stormwater management practices, as appropriate. The filing of an appeal with complete information shall stay the payment of the stormwater drainage fee. Any person seeking a stormwater drainage fee adjustment based upon stormwater management practices shall be current in the payment of the stormwater drainage fee. The director may request additional information from the appealing party. Stormwater drainage fee adjustments for stormwater management practices may be considered for: reductions in stormwater release rates and provision of additional storage volume; reductions in runoff volume (including discharging to a noncity drainage system); and properly designed, constructed and maintained existing detention facilities. The maximum fee adjustment for internally drained areas or runoff reduced to zero is 40 percent. The maximum fee adjustment for drainage to a noncity system is 40 percent. The maximum fee adjustment for existing detention facilities meeting applicable city design standards and subject to proper maintenance and operation as determined by the city is 15 percent. The maximum fee adjustment for detention, discharge/volume improvements and operation and maintenance is 25 percent if the release rate is limited to the two-year predeveloped flow and 15 percent for 100-year storage volume. Based upon the information provided by the utility and the appealing party, the director shall make a final calculation of the stormwater drainage fee. The director shall notify the parties, in writing, of the director’s decision. (Ord. 19496 § 125, 12-21-10; Ord. 17134 § 1, 6-24-97; Ord. 17059 § 18(E), 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-400. Formerly 14.85.100.)

13.25.100 Collection of fee.

(a) The drainage fee for all property shall be billed and collected monthly. All such bills for drainage fees shall be rendered monthly by the water division. The drainage fee for those properties utilizing city utilities is part of a consolidated statement for utility customers which is generally paid by a single payment. In the event that a partial payment is received, the payment shall be applied pro rata to each account billed on the consolidated statement in the proportion that an individual account bears to the total consolidated statement of all current charges for all accounts. In the event of a partial month’s service, the bill shall be calculated based upon the number of days served. All bills for drainage fees shall become due and payable upon receipt and may be collected as any other account due and owing to the city.

(b) Drainage fees shall be subject to a five percent per month, not to exceed 25 percent, late fee. The city shall be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees incurred in collecting delinquent drainage fees. Any charge due under this article which shall not be paid when due may be recovered in an action at law by the city. The employees of the city shall, at all reasonable times, have access to any premises served by the city for inspection, repair or the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

(c) All drainage fees assessed pursuant to this chapter may be certified to the county clerk as a lien upon the property to which such fee is associated from the date such fee becomes due until such fee is paid. The owner of every building, premises, lot or house shall be obligated to pay the fee for all service provided to the premises, which obligation may be enforced by the city by action at law or by suit to enforce the lien, in the same manner as other taxes due and owing to the city. In the event of such action, the city shall be entitled to recover all court costs and reasonable attorney fees for such collection. In the case that a tenant in possession of any premises or buildings shall pay such fees, it shall relieve the landowner from such obligation and lien; but the city shall not be required to look to any person whatsoever other than the owner for the payment of such fees. No changes of ownership or occupation shall affect the application of this chapter, and the failure of any owner to be advised that he purchased property against which a lien for drainage fees exists shall in no way affect his responsibility for such payment. (Ord. 19496 § 126, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 19, 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-402. Formerly 14.85.110.)


13.25.110 Program responsibility.

It shall be the duty of the utilities director to administer the stormwater utility and the director may delegate such duty and responsibility within the utilities department as is necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. The department shall keep an accurate record of all persons using the services and facilities of such stormwater management system of the city and to make changes in accordance with the rates and charges established in this chapter. (Ord. 20089 § 101, 10-17-17.)

    Cross References: Utilities department, TMC 2.30.120.


13.25.120 Stormwater utility enterprise fund.

(a) All stormwater drainage fees collected by the city shall be paid into an enterprise fund which is hereby created, to be known as the “stormwater utility fund.” Such fund shall be used for the purpose of paying the costs of operation, administration and maintenance of the stormwater drainage facilities of the city and to carry out all other purposes of the utility. To the extent that the stormwater drainage fees collected are insufficient to construct the needed stormwater drainage facilities, the cost of the same may be paid from such city fund as may be determined by the city council, but the city council may order the reimbursement of such fund if additional fees are thereafter collected. When the fund has surplus dollars on hand in excess of current needs, the surplus dollars will be invested to return the highest yield consistent with proper safeguards. Any interest earned on invested surplus dollars shall be placed in the stormwater utility fund.

(b) The fees and charges paid and other income received shall not be used for general or other governmental or proprietary purposes of the city, except to pay for the equitable share of the cost of accounting, management and government thereof. Other than as described above, the fees and charges shall be used solely for the purposes stated herein. (Ord. 19496 § 128, 12-21-10; Ord. 17059 § 21, 12-17-96. Code 1995 § 146-404.

13.30.070 General provisions.

Responsibility to Implement Best Management Practices. Notwithstanding the presence or absence of requirements of this chapter, any person engaged in activities or operation, or owning facilities or property which will or may result in pollutants entering stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. shall implement best management practices to the extent they are technologically achievable to prevent and reduce such pollutants.

(a) Any person undertaking land disturbance activities shall comply with the requirements and standards set forth in this chapter. Permit requirements for land disturbance activities are set forth in this chapter.

(b) Applicability. Regardless of whether or not a land disturbance activity requires a permit, any person engaged in any land disturbance activity shall comply with the spirit and intent of this chapter. At a minimum, such persons shall employ BMPs for erosion and sediment control in proportion to the scale of the activity to reduce the amount of sediment or other pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with those activities.

(c) Responsible Person(s). When the term “responsible person(s)” is used in this chapter, it shall mean the landowner of the property upon which a land disturbance activity takes place and any person(s) performing a land disturbance activity. When a permit is issued, a landowner is responsible for land disturbance activities from permit issuance to closure, unless the city approves a transfer of responsibility to a new landowner when land is sold. 

(d) Time Requirement. Where land disturbance activities have temporarily or permanently ceased on a portion of a project site for over 14 consecutive days, the disturbed areas shall be protected from erosion by stabilizing the areas with mulch or other similarly effective soil stabilizing BMPs, unless the timeframe for compliance is extended by the utilities director. Where implementation of stabilization measures is precluded by snow cover, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable. (Ord. 20089 § 104, 10-17-17.)

    Cross References: Utilities department, TMC 2.30.120.


13.30.080 Permit.

(a) No person shall receive any permit for building, grading or other land development without meeting the requirements of this title and obtaining a land disturbance activity permit. Additionally, no responsible person shall initiate any grading or other land disturbance activity without first obtaining a land disturbance activity permit.

(b) Application – Requirements. A land disturbance activity permit shall be required when any of the following occur:

(1) The removal, increase or stockpiling of any materials exceeds either 3,000 square feet or 100 cubic yards.

(2) The grading, excavation or stockpiling of any earthwork significantly changes a recognized, established watercourse or results in a significant change in drainage or runoff conditions to an established drainage easement of record.

(3) The land disturbance activity exceeds one acre in area.

(4) The utilities director determines that a land disturbance activity permit is required because of unique circumstances and a potential impact on the environment.

(c) The land disturbance activity permit shall be obtained prior to clearing of land in preparation for any of the activities set out in this section. When the area exceeds one acre, the land disturbance activity permit must be applied for at least 90 days prior to beginning construction.

(d) Application – Exceptions. A land disturbance activity permit shall not be required for the following:

(1) The removal or increase of earthwork in conjunction with any construction project of less than 3,000 square feet for which a building or construction permit has been issued, provided the removal or increase of earthwork is contained on the parcel of property at which the land disturbance activity is taking place. Property adjoining the parcel of property for which a building permit or construction permit has been issued may be used for the temporary storage of fill material, provided written permission has been obtained from the adjoining property owner and the storage of fill materials ends at the completion of the permitted work. However, the work will conform to the standards and other requirements of this chapter and other applicable city ordinances.

(2) Cemetery graves.

(iii) For disturbed areas less than 10 acres, sedimentation basins are encouraged, but not required. The responsible person shall install erosion and sediment controls at locations directed by the utilities director. Minimum requirements include silt fences, rock check dams, or other equivalent control measures along slopes. Silt fences, rock check dams, etc., must be regularly inspected and maintained.

(8) Sediment Basins Related to Impervious Surface Area. Where a project’s ultimate development replaces surface vegetation with one or more cumulative acres of impervious surface, and all runoff has not been accounted for in the city of Topeka’s existing stormwater management plan or practice, runoff from the one-half-inch 24-hour storm event shall be treated unless discharge is to a special water where runoff from the one-inch 24-hour storm event shall be treated.

(9) Silt Fence. Silt fence shall be properly installed by being trenched and buried at least six inches into the soil. Generally, sufficient silt fence will be required to contain sheet flow runoff generated at an individual site.

(10) Stockpile Protections. For soil stockpiles greater than 10 cubic yards the toe of the pile must be more than 25 feet from a road, drainage channel or stormwater inlet. If left for more than seven days, erosion from stockpiles must be controlled with perimeter control devices such as silt fence. If the physical features on the site prevent stockpiling at least 25 feet from a road drainage channel or stormwater inlet, the utilities director may allow stockpiling within 25 feet, provided the stockpile must be controlled with perimeter control devices immediately.

(11) Vehicle Entrances. Temporary rock construction entrances must be installed and maintained wherever vehicles enter and exit a site. The design of this entrance shall take into consideration the amount of traffic that will be entering and exiting the site. Construction entrances shall be stabilized with at least two-inch clear aggregate or an approved equal as determined by the utilities director. On sites with high traffic, the utilities director may require wash racks, wash ponds or other means of minimizing sediment leaving the site.

(12) Street Cleaning. Streets shall be cleaned and swept within 24 hours whenever tracking of sediments occurs and before sites are left idle for weekends and holidays.

(13) Dewatering Treatment Required. Sediment laden water that is being removed from the site by pumping or trenching shall be treated to remove a minimum of 80 percent of suspended solids before discharge. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion to receiving channels or flooding of the discharge site.

(14) Storm Drain Protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected during construction with control measures as approved by the utilities director. These devices shall remain in place until final stabilization of the site. A regular inspection and maintenance plan shall be developed and implemented to assure these devices are operational at all times. Storm drain protection shall be removed and area inlet shall be cleaned of debris following site stabilization.

(f) Modification of Plan. The responsible person must amend the erosion control plan or SWPPP as necessary to include additional requirements such as additional or modified BMPs designed to correct problems identified or address situations whenever:

(1) A change in design, construction, operation, maintenance, weather, or seasonal conditions that has a significant effect on the discharge of pollutants to surface waters or underground waters.

(2) Inspections indicate the erosion control plan or SWPPP is not effective in eliminating or significantly minimizing the discharge of pollutants to surface waters or underground waters or that the discharges are causing water quality standard exceedances.

(3) The SWPPP is not achieving the general objectives of controlling pollutants or is not consistent with the terms and conditions of this permit. (Ord. 20089 § 106, 10-17-17.)

PERMIT COMPLETION

R110.1 Use and occupancy.

It shall be the duty of the permit holder to request all required inspections and to complete the permit by passing the final inspection prior to occupancy or use of the building. No change in the existing occupancy classification of a building or structure or portion thereof shall be made until all required inspections and permits have been completed and approved by the building official. Completion of a permit shall not be construed as an approval of a violation of the provisions of this code or of other ordinances. 

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) and absent a waiver pursuant to subsection (c), a final inspection shall not be completed and passed unless driveway approaches have been installed and sidewalks constructed along all adjoining rights-of-way of the subject lot or all lots or portions thereof joined to it or are the subject of a contract as part of a benefit district created pursuant to K.S.A. 12-6a01 et seq. or Title 18 of the Topeka Municipal Code.

(2) The sidewalk is the subject of a waiver granted in conjunction with approval of the subdivision plat.

(3) Unique circumstances exist where the public works director or designee determine that the subject sidewalk link would not be part of a viable sidewalk system in that community or conditions exist whereby construction of the sidewalk is impractical.

(4) The home is located on a corner lot or double-frontage lot and the sidewalk link along one of the lot’s two frontages meets one of the waiver criteria in subsection (c).

(5) Weather conditions prevented installation of the driveway approaches or construction of the sidewalks. However, in such event, the property owner shall install driveway approaches and construct sidewalks within 90 days from the date of the final inspection.

R110.2 Change in use. Changes in the character or use of an existing structure shall not be made except as specified in Sections 3406 and 3407 of the International Building Code. 

R110.3 Temporary occupancy. The building official is authorized to allow use and/or occupancy before the completion of the entire work covered by the permit, provided that such portion or portions shall be occupied safely. The building official may upon the request of the permit holder set a time period during which the temporary use and/or occupancy is valid. The conditions of temporary use and/or occupancy and specified time period shall be in writing. The permit holder is responsible for permit completion per R110.1. 

R110.4 Revocation. The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke use and/or occupancy allowed under the provisions of this code, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or where it is determined that the building or structure or portion thereof is in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this code.

Article I. Generally


17.05.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard life, limb, property and the public welfare by regulating grading and excavation on public and private property. (Ord. 16432 § 1, 3-10-92. Code 1995 § 66-86.)


17.05.020 Scope.

This chapter sets forth rules and regulations to control grading, excavation and earthwork construction, including fills, embankments and clearing of land in preparation for these activities; establishes the administrative procedure for approval of plans, issuance of permits, and inspection of the project before, during and upon final completion of the work. (Ord. 16432 § 2, 3-10-92. Code 1995 § 66-87.)


17.05.030 Penalty for violation of chapter.

Violation of this chapter shall be deemed to be a violation of the code of the city of Topeka and may be prosecuted as such in municipal court. (Ord. 16432 § 10, 3-10-92. Code 1995 § 66-88.)


17.05.040 Grading inspections.

(a) Generally. All grading operations for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the public works department.

(b) Grading Designations. All grading in excess of five acres or 5,000 cubic yards shall be performed in accordance with the approved grading plan prepared by a civil engineer, and shall be designated as “engineered grading.” Grading involving less than five acres or 5,000 cubic yards shall be designated “regular grading” unless the permittee, with the approval of the public works director, chooses to have the grading performed as engineered grading.

(c) Engineered Grading Requirements.

(1) For engineered grading, it shall be the responsibility of the civil engineer who prepares the approved grading plan to incorporate all recommendations from the soils engineering and engineering geology reports into the grading plan. The civil engineer shall also be responsible for the professional inspection and approval of the grading within his area of technical specialty. This responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to, inspection and approval as to the establishment of line, grade and drainage of the development area.

(2) The civil engineer shall act as the coordinating agent in the event the need arises for liaison between the other professionals, the contractor and the public works department. The civil engineer shall also be responsible for the preparation of revised plans and the submission of as-graded grading plans upon completion of the work. The permit holder shall submit in a form prescribed by the development coordination office a statement of compliance to such as-built plan.

(3) During grading all necessary reports, compaction data and soil engineering and engineering geology recommendations shall be submitted to the civil engineer and the development coordination office by the soils engineer and the engineering geologist. The soils engineer’s area of responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to, the professional inspection and approval concerning the preparation of ground to receive fills, testing for required compaction, stability of all finish slopes and the design of buttress fills, where required, incorporating data supplied by the engineering geologist. The engineering geologist’s area of responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to, professional inspection and approval of the adequacy of natural ground for receiving fills and the stability of cut slopes with respect to geological matters and the need for subdrains or other groundwater drainage devices. He shall report his findings to the soils engineer and the civil engineer for engineering analysis.

(4) The public works department shall inspect the project at the various stages of the work requiring approval to determine that adequate control is being exercised by the professional consultants.

(d) Regular Grading Requirements. The development coordination office may require inspection and testing by an approved testing agency. The testing agency’s responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to, approval concerning the inspection of cleared areas, benches to receive fill, and the compaction of fills. When the development coordination office has reason to believe that geologic factors may be involved, the grading operation will be required to conform to engineered grading requirements.

(e) Notification of Noncompliance. If, in the course of fulfilling the responsibility under this chapter, the civil engineer, the soils engineer, the engineering geologist or the testing agency finds that the work is not being done in conformance with this chapter or the approved grading plans, the discrepancies shall be reported immediately in writing to the person in charge of the grading work and to the public works director. Recommendations for corrective measures, if necessary, shall also be submitted.

17.30.020 Penalties for violation of chapter.

(a) Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not to exceed $499.00 and, in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

(b) Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the city or other appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 19627 § 3, 8-23-11.)


17.30.030 Statutory authorization.

The legislature of the state of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 19627 § 4, 8-23-11.)


17.30.040 Findings of fact.

(a) Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(b) General Causes of the Flood Losses. Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

(c) Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps.

(1) Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. The base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator’s FIS, and illustrative materials dated September 29, 2011, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.

(2) Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.

(3) Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point.

(4) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.

(5) Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. (Ord. 19627 § 5, 8-23-11.)


17.30.050 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in TMC 17.30.040; to establish or maintain the city of Topeka’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this chapter to:

(a) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;

(b) Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and

(c) Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. (Ord. 19627 § 6, 8-23-11.)


17.30.060 Compliance.

No development located within the special flood hazard areas of the city shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. (Ord. 19627 § 7, 8-23-11.)


17.30.070 Lands to which this chapter applies.

(a) This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city identified as numbered and unnumbered A, AE, AO, and AH zones, on the index map dated September 29, 2011, of the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as amended and any future revisions thereto and the flood insurance study (FIS). In all areas covered by this chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or its designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in Article III of this chapter.

(b) In addition, this chapter shall also apply to those lands which, based on the most accurate information available to the development services director, fall within the ultimate 100-year floodplain. (Ord. 19627 § 8, 8-23-11.)

17.30.080 Abrogation.

It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. (Ord. 19627 § 9, 8-23-11.)


17.30.090 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes. (Ord. 19627 § 10, 8-23-11.)


17.30.100 Warning; disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 19627 § 11, 8-23-11.)


17.30.110 Severability.

If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. (Ord. 19627 § 12, 8-23-11.)


17.30.120 Amendments.

The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this chapter may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973; provided, however, that no such action may be taken until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties of interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the public hearing. A copy of such amendments will be provided to the FEMA Region VII office. The regulations of this chapter are in compliance with the NFIP regulations. (Ord. 19627 § 13, 8-23-11.)

(Ord. 19627 § 18, 8-23-11.)


17.30.180 General standards.

(a) No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial improvements, and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes, within any numbered or unnumbered A, AE, AO, and AH zones, unless the conditions of this article are satisfied.

(b) All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within unnumbered A zones is subject to all provisions of this chapter. If flood insurance study data is not available, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources.

(c) Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted within any unnumbered or numbered A zones, or AE zones on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

(d) All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments shall require:

(1) Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;

(2) Construction with materials resistant to flood damage;

(3) Utilization of methods and practices that minimize flood damages;

(4) All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other service facilities be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;

(5) New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination from them during flooding; and

(6) Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, located within special flood hazard areas are required to assure that:

(i) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning. (Ord. 19627 § 19, 8-23-11.)

Article III. Flood Hazard Reduction


17.30.190 Specific standards.

(a) In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A, AE, and AH zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in TMC 17.30.170(b), the following provisions are required:

(1) Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above base flood elevation. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.

(2) Nonresidential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be dry floodproofed to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in TMC 17.30.140(i).

(3) Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(i) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and

(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. (Ord. 19627 § 20, 8-23-11.)


17.30.200 Manufactured homes.

(a) All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A, AE, and AH zones on the community’s FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

(b) Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A, AE, and AH zones, on the community’s FIRM on sites:

(1) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;

(2) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

(3) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

(4) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.

(c) Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A, AE and AH zones, on the community’s FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, be elevated so that either:

(1) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of one foot above the base flood level; or

(2) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer. (Ord. 19627 § 21, 8-23-11.)


17.30.210 Areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones).

Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in TMC 17.30.070 are areas designated as AO and AH zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply:

(a) AO Zones.

(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that level so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.

(3) Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

(b) AH Zones.

(1) The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation has been provided shall be required as set forth in TMC 17.30.190.

(2) Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 19627 § 22, 8-23-11.)


17.30.220 Floodway.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in TMC 17.30.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:

(a) The city shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.

(b) The city shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(c) If subsection (b) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III of this chapter.

(d) In unnumbered A zones, the city shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in TMC 17.30.180(b). (Ord. 19627 § 23, 8-23-11.)


17.30.230 Recreational vehicles.

(a) Recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A, AE, AH, and AO zones on the community’s FIRM shall either:

(1) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

(2) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or

(3) Meet the permitting, elevation, and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this chapter.

(b) A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 19627 § 24, 8-23-11.)

Article IV. Floodplain Management Variance Procedures


17.30.240 Establishment of appeal board.

(a) The board of zoning appeals (board) shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management requirements of this chapter.

(b) Where an application for a floodplain development permit is denied by the floodplain administrator, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit directly to the board.

(c) The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

(d) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the district court as provided in K.S.A. 12-759 and 12-760. (Ord. 19627 § 25, 8-23-11.)

    Cross References: Board of zoning appeals, TMC 2.45.010.


17.30.250 Floodplain management variance criteria.

In reviewing applications for variances, the board shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following criteria:

(a) Danger to life and property due to flood damage;

(b) Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(c) Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

(d) Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(e) Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(f) Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use;

(g) Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(h) Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(i) Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(j) Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and

(k) Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. (Ord. 19627 § 26, 8-23-11.)

    Cross References: Board of zoning appeals, TMC 2.45.010.


17.30.260 Conditions for approving variances.

(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, providing subsections (b) through (f) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(b) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, repair, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure’s continued historic designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(c) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood discharge would result.

(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(e) Variances shall only be issued upon: (1) showing of good and sufficient cause, (2) determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (3) determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(f) The development services director shall notify the applicant that: (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. (Ord. 19627 § 27, 8-23-11.)

(b) Illumination. Illumination for types of signs is regulated in TMC 18.10.130, 18.10.160, and 18.10.180. In no case shall the light from an illuminated sign create a negative effect on residential uses in direct line-of-sight of the sign.

(c) Sight Distance at Intersections. No sign that obstructs the view is allowed within the sight distance triangle of a street intersection.

(d) Other Applicable Regulations.

(1) All signs shall be installed, erected, constructed, hung, or altered in accordance with the building and fire codes adopted by the City.

(2) Any structure that is built or constructed and supports or is capable of supporting a sign shall be constructed in compliance with the building and fire codes adopted by the City.

(3) A sign structure shall include the foundation and base, the poles or pylons that support the sign, any structural extensions that support a sign or sign cabinet, and any structural framework that supports a sign, sign face, or sign cabinet.

(4) Design documents for the structure that have been prepared, sealed, signed and dated by a structural engineer and designed in accordance with the building code must be submitted for review and approval with the sign permit application.

(5) All signs projecting over the public right-of-way (PROW) vertical clearance must be maintained as required by the currently adopted codes and ordinances for use of the PROW in accordance with the building code.

(6) All signs projecting over walkways, sidewalks, or other areas in front of a building, or other active area where pedestrians have access, shall maintain a minimum of eight feet of vertical clearance and as required by the currently adopted codes and ordinances for use of the PROW in accordance with the building code.

(7) Projecting wall signs shall project only as allowed in compliance with the building code.

(8) Awnings, canopies, awning signs, and canopy signs shall be securely attached to and supported by the building to which they are attached and shall properly be maintained in such manner. (Ord. 20207 § 8, 9-10-19.)


18.10.080 Sign area and height measurements.

(a) Sign Area – Freestanding Signs.

(1) Generally. For a sign with one sign face, sign area is computed by means of the smallest square or rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any panel or material forming an integral part of the background of the display against which it is placed, other than structural supports, but including structural supports for temporary or incidental signs.


[IMAGE]


(2) Computation of Area of Multi-Faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face is computed by adding together the area, measured as provided in this subsection (a), of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area is computed by measuring one of the faces as provided in this subsection (a).
[IMAGE]


(b) Sign Area – Attached Signs.

(1) Where sign size is prescribed as a percentage of wall area, the “wall area” is a continuous portion of a building facade below the roofline or major architectural feature as viewed by a person approaching the building.

(2) Where sign size is prescribed as a factor of building frontage, the “building frontage” is the width of the exterior wall on which the sign is located as viewed by a person approaching the building. For the purpose of measurement the wall used as building frontage need not be on the same wall plane.
[IMAGE]


(3) For an attached sign which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area and dimensions include the entire portion within the background or frame.
[IMAGE]


(4) For an attached sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure with no distinct mounting surface (such as a board or plastic face) other than the wall, the area is calculated by applying the smallest regular geometric shape possible (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.) around all letters, figures or elements.

(5) When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which comprises all of the display areas, including the space between different elements.

(6) The sign area does not include any supporting framework, bracing, artistic elements not part of the sign copy, or decorative fence or wall when the fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
[IMAGE]



[IMAGE]


(c) Sign Height. The height of a freestanding sign means the vertical distance from the top of the highest part of a sign, whether the highest part be the sign copy or support structure on which the sign is placed, to the adjoining sidewalk, improved surface, or ground surface within a three-foot horizontal distance of the base of the sign. In the event the surface is sloped the average of the height of the adjoining surface shall be used. For signs with artistic elements exceeding the allowed height, the Planning and Development Director may determine if artistic elements shall be excluded when measuring sign height.
[IMAGE]


(d) Vertical Clearance. Vertical clearance for detached and projecting signs is measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments.
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 20207 § 9, 9-10-19.)


18.10.090 Maintenance.

(a) Generally. All signs shall be maintained in good condition. A sign with missing or visibly damaged face panels, exposed internal lights and related internal hardware, visible deteriorating paint and rust, or structural damage that may be hazardous to the public is not in good condition and shall be repaired or removed within a reasonable time as determined by the Planning and Development Director.

(b) Unsafe Signs. The Planning and Development Director shall notify the property owner or person maintaining any sign which has become insecure or in danger of falling, or is otherwise unsafe. Upon receipt of such notice, the property owner or person maintaining the sign shall proceed immediately to place the sign in a safe and secure manner and condition as approved by the Planning and Development Director or the property owner shall remove the sign. (Ord. 20207 § 10, 9-10-19.)


18.10.100 Abandoned signs.

(a) An abandoned sign is any sign for which the use to which it had applied has changed or the property containing the use has become vacant.

(b) A property owner shall either: (i) remove an abandoned sign that has been located on the property for more than six months; or (ii) shall cover the sign. For the purpose of this section, “covered” shall mean all sign copy including graphics is rendered invisible by being painted over, removed, replaced, or shielded by a rigid and opaque material.

(c) For a nonconforming abandoned sign that has been located on the property for more than 24 months, the property owner shall remove it.

(d) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, a property owner shall remove a nonconforming abandoned sign immediately when the primary building on the property is demolished or removed.

(e) Any abandoned sign shall comply with this section on or after October 1, 2020.

(f) Upon removal, all parts of the sign, including structural supports, shall be removed. (Ord. 20207 § 11, 9-10-19.)


18.10.110 Nonconforming signs.

(a) All nonconforming signs that were lawful prior to October 1, 2019, and not abandoned may continue without being brought into conformance with this chapter if no alterations are proposed to the sign or property. Except as provided in this section, a nonconforming sign may not be altered in such a manner as to augment the nonconforming condition, nor may illumination be added.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the sign shall conform to the standards of this chapter if the sign is altered, other than a reface or sign maintenance. As an alternative to compliance with the dimensional standards in TMC 18.10.130, any freestanding sign at a nonconforming height or area may be altered provided its height and area are reduced by 34 percent or more of its current height and area.

(c) In addition, any reface or alteration of copy shall at a minimum achieve partial compliance by reducing its corresponding sign area or height by at least 34 percent if the change accompanies one of the following events on or after October 1, 2019:

(1) Rezoning of the property at the request of the owner.

(2) Fifty percent or more of the primary structure is damaged or rendered not usable.

(3) Any major building addition/expansion that requires site plan approval.

(4) Any major facade renovation that requires approval of building elevation design.

(5) Any property that is included in a neighborhood revitalization plan, a tax-increment financing district or a community improvement district.

(d) Any sign height reduced to 25 feet or less in height must conform to monument sign requirements.

(e) The Planning and Development Director may allow alterations to a sign determined to be a historic sign in accordance with TMC 18.10.150 without requiring conformance with this chapter, provided the sign is safe and properly maintained in accordance with TMC 18.10.090.

(f) Effective October 1, 2039, any freestanding sign that was nonconforming on October 1, 2019, shall be removed, replaced, or altered in a manner that conforms to the standards applicable to freestanding signs in this chapter. (Ord. 20207 § 12, 9-10-19.)


18.10.120 Variances.

Any person seeking a sign permit not meeting the dimensional and design standards of this chapter may request a variance pursuant to Chapter 2.45 TMC. (Ord. 20207 § 13, 9-10-19.)


18.10.130 On-premises sign standards by type and district.

(a) All sign copy shall pertain only to the business, industry or other pursuit conducted on or within the premises on which such sign is erected or maintained except as provided in TMC 18.10.180 (Off-premises signs).

(b) This section establishes standards for individual attached sign types, including standards for:

(1) Illumination.

(2) Whether the particular sign type is permitted in a particular zoning district.

(3) The maximum number of signs per building or parcel.

(4) Maximum sign area allocation for wall signs, awning and canopy signs, roof signs, and projecting signs.

(5) For freestanding signs, the maximum number per street frontage, maximum height, maximum area, and notes and exceptions specific to freestanding signs.

(6) Incidental signs.

(c) Illumination. Internal, external, and halo lit illumination are allowed except where expressly prohibited. Direct illumination is allowed in C-2, C-3, C-4, I-1, I-2, X-1, X-3, D-1, and D-3 zoning districts, and is prohibited in all other zoning districts.

(d) Wall Signs.

(1) Definitions.

(i) Wall Sign. A sign, other than a projecting sign, roof sign or window sign, that uses a building wall as its primary source of support and that (A) is placed directly on and contained totally within the dimensions of the outside wall; and (B) does not extend more than 18 inches from a building surface.

(f) Pole Banners. Decorative banners are exempt from the maximum number, dimensions, and location requirements of TMC 18.10.130 if they are: (1) mounted on a pole that provides a separate functional purpose such as street lighting in the right-of-way; (2) contain no commercial message or advertising or other elements of a “sign” as defined in this chapter; and (3) are allowed by the City in the right-of-way. (Ord. 20207 § 16, 9-10-19.)


18.10.160 Electronic message centers (EMCs).

(a) Electronic message center signs may be erected in the following zoning districts: RR, R, M, O&I, C, I, U-1, MS-1 and X, only if the sign is allowed in the respective district and the sign meets all of the following standards:

(1) Brightness. An EMC shall utilize automatic dimming technology to adjust the brightness of the sign relative to ambient light so that at no time shall an EMC exceed a brightness level of 0.3 foot-candle above ambient light, as measured using a foot-candle (lux) meter calibrated within the past 36 months and in conformance with the following process:

(i) Light measurements shall be taken with the meter aimed perpendicular to the sign message face or at the area of the sign emitting the brightest light if that area is not the sign message face, at a preset distance depending on sign size. Distance shall be determined by taking the square root of the product of the sign area and 100. For example, using a 12-square-foot sign: √(12 x 100) = 34.6 feet measuring distance.

(ii) An ambient light measurement shall be taken using a foot-candle meter at some point between the period of time between 30 minutes past sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise with the sign turned off to a black screen.

(iii) Immediately following the ambient light measurement taken in the manner required by this subsection, an operating sign light measurement shall be taken with the sign turned on to full white copy.

(iv) The brightness of an EMC shall comply with the brightness requirements of this subsection if the difference between the ambient light measurement and the operating sign light measurement is 0.3 foot-candle or less.

(2) Movement. The following display features are prohibited: flashing, strobing, blinking, fluttering, spinning, rotating, bouncing, animation, scrolling and chasing.

(i) Exception: An EMC located within the I, C-2, C-3, C-4, or C-5 district which is not within 125 feet of a residential or open space district may have animation, scrolling text, and frame effects.

(3) Right-of-Way, Portable EMCs. An EMC shall not overhang into a public right-of-way and shall not be included in a portable sign.

(4) Audio Messages. An EMC shall not include any audio message, tones or music.

(5) Dwell Times – C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 and I. EMCs located within a C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 or I district and within 125 feet of a residential or open space district may only display static images having a dwell time of at least four seconds and a transition time of two seconds or less and this transition may use frame effects without illusionary or simulating movement.

(6) Dwell Times – Signs for Nonresidential Uses in Residential Districts. EMCs incorporated into signs for nonresidential uses in residential districts shall have a dwell time of at least eight seconds.

(7) Dwell Times – O&I, C-1, U-1, MS-1, X-1, X-2. EMCs located within an O&I, C-1, U-1, MS-1, X-1, or X-2 district may only display static images having a dwell time of at least four seconds and a transition time of two seconds or less and this transition may use frame effects without illusionary or simulating movement.

(8) Compliance Assurance. No permit shall be granted unless the applicant provides sufficient proof from the manufacturer that the sign has the technical capacity to comply with all applicable regulations governing EMCs and that the sign owner and/or operator has reviewed and understands the applicable regulations pertaining to the EMC and agrees not to violate the regulations.

(b) Nonconforming EMCs. An EMC in existence on July 16, 2013, that did not meet the standards regarding audio messages, movement, and brightness in Ordinance No. 19830 shall have complied with the requirements of Ordinance No. 19830 by September 1, 2013. (Ord. 20207 § 17, 9-10-19.)

18.40.010 Classification of subdivisions.

Subdivisions are classified as follows:

(a) Class A. All subdivisions located within the corporate limits of the city.

(b) Class B.

(1) All subdivisions adjoining or touching the corporate limits of the city;

(2) All subdivisions adjoining or touching the boundaries of a tract or area for which annexation proceedings have been commenced by the city;

(3) All subdivisions touching or adjoining an approved subdivision which touches or adjoins the corporate boundaries of the city; and

(4) All subdivisions outside of the city limits, but within three miles thereof, that do not adjoin or touch the boundaries of the city and do not adjoin or touch a subdivision that adjoins or touches the boundaries of the city but lie adjacent to a major traffic thoroughfare.

(c) Class C. All subdivisions lying within three miles of the corporate limits of the city that do not adjoin or touch the boundaries of the city, and do not adjoin or touch the boundary of a subdivision that does adjoin or touch the boundaries of the city, and do not lie adjacent to a major traffic thoroughfare. (Code 1981 § 41-89. Code 1995 § 134-131.)


18.40.020 Size and shape determined by availability of water and sewer facilities.

(a) Generally. In all classes of subdivisions, the size and shape of the lots will be determined by the availability and adequacy of public sewer and public water facilities as follows:

(1) The determination of whether or not city water is available in adequate quantities to serve the subdivision shall be made in the following manner:

(i) A copy of the preliminary plat shall be sent to the department of public works for recommendation.

(ii) Upon receipt of the recommendation by the department, the subdivision committee shall report the facts to the planning commission.

(iii) The planning commission shall make its recommendation on the plat and on the availability and adequacy of city water to the council after the public hearing on the final plat.

(2) The determination of whether or not a public water company can furnish water in adequate supply to the subdivision shall be determined in the following manner:

(i) If the subdivider desires to use the facilities of a public water company, the subdivider shall submit an affidavit subscribed and sworn to by an official of the public water company, stating that the company is ready, willing and able to supply water in sufficient quantities to serve the subdivision.

(ii) Upon receipt of the affidavit and preliminary plat, the subdivision committee shall receive it and report the facts to the planning commission.

(iii) The planning commission shall make its recommendation, on the plat, on the availability and adequacy of water to the council after a public hearing on the final plat.

(b) Class A Subdivisions. For class A subdivisions:

(1) If the proposed subdivision is serviced with city water and public sewer or a community type sewage treatment plant, approval of the plat shall be subject to the minimum requirements set forth in this subsection (b).

(2) If the proposed subdivision is serviced with city water but not with a public sewer system or a community type sewage treatment plant, a preliminary plat will be submitted on the basis of one-half acre lots and shall be subject to the approval of the health department, which shall make soil percolation tests for each lot and make recommendations to the planning commission regarding lot sizes. The lots will be so proportioned as to permit future replatting consistent with good subdivision design.

(3) If the proposed subdivision is serviced by a public sewer system and not with city water and the developer will use a private water supply, the preliminary plat will be submitted on the basis of one-half acre lots, subject to the approval of the health department, which may make recommendations as to lot sizes. The lots shall be so proportioned as to permit future platting consistent with good subdivision design. The suggested desirable proportion is 160 feet frontage by 270 feet depth.

(4) If the proposed subdivision is not serviced with either city water or a public sewer system and the developer will be using a private water supply with septic tank sewage disposal, the subdivider shall submit the preliminary plat on the basis of one acre lots, subject to the approval of the health department, which shall make soil percolation tests and submit its recommendation regarding lot sizes to the planning commission. The lots will be so proportioned as to permit future replatting consistent with good subdivision design. Such plat shall carry a restriction prohibiting the installation of septic tank lateral fields within 25 feet of any property boundary line or private water supply, and the minimum lot dimensions in any direction shall be 150 feet.

(c) Class B Subdivisions. For class B subdivisions:

(1) If the proposed subdivision is serviced with a public water supply and a public sewage system or a community type sewage disposal treatment plant, the plat shall be subject to the minimum requirements set forth in this subsection (c).

(2) If the proposed subdivision is serviced with a public water supply but not with a public sewage system or a community type sewage disposal treatment plant, the plat shall be submitted on the basis of building site areas that are determined by soil percolation tests as performed by the health department. The health department shall make a recommendation to the planning commission on the building site areas based on the results of the soil percolation tests.

(3) If the proposed subdivision is serviced by a public sewage system or a community type sewage treatment plant and not with a public water supply, the plat shall be subject to the minimum requirements set forth in this subsection (c). However, the building site areas shall contain a minimum dimension of 100 feet at the front building line.

(4) If the proposed subdivision is not serviced with a public water supply, a public sewage system or a community type sewage treatment plant, the plat shall be submitted on the basis of building site areas that are determined by soil percolation tests as performed by the health department. The health department shall make a recommendation to the planning commission on the building site areas based on the results of the soil percolation tests; provided, however, the minimum building site areas shall contain at least one acre in area and have minimum dimensions of 125 feet at the front building line.

(5) In those class B subdivisions which touch or adjoin the corporate limits of the city or touch or adjoin an area on which annexation proceedings have been commenced, then the owner shall submit a written consent to annexation of the subdivision to the city along with the preliminary plat.

(d) Class C Subdivisions. The requirements and regulations pertaining to class C subdivisions are the same requirements as those applied to class B subdivisions, with the exception that in class C subdivisions the subdivider shall not be required to submit a written consent to annexation of the proposed subdivision. (Code 1981 § 41-90. Code 1995 § 134-132.)

	 	Building site area	Soil percolation rate

	(1)	One-half acre	One inch per hour

	(2)	One acre	One-half inch per hour

	(3)	One and one-half acres	One-quarter inch per hour

	(4)	Three acres	Less than one-quarter inch per hour

(c) Each building site in the subdivision shall be subject to the following restrictions:

(1) The minimum distance from any septic tank and lateral field to:

	(i)	Water supply    	50 feet

	(ii)	Watercourse    	25 feet

	(iii)	Dwelling or property line    	10 feet

(2) The minimum distance from water wells and underground storage reservoirs to:

18.40.040 Block dimensions.

(a) Length. In general, intersecting streets that determine block lengths shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets or customary subdivision practices in the neighborhood. In residential districts, where no existing plats are recorded, the blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length, except that in outlying subdivisions a greater length may be permitted where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block, and such pedestrian ways or easements shall have a minimum width of 10 feet.

(b) Width. In residential development the block width shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as may be considered most suitable for the prospective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. (Code 1981 § 41-92. Code 1995 § 134-134.)

(d) Right Angle Intersections. Under normal conditions, streets in subdivisions shall be laid out to intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other conditions justify a variation from the right angle intersection, the minimum angle shall be 60 degrees.

(e) Streets Adjacent to a Railroad Right-of-Way, Limited Access Freeway or Other Major Thoroughfares. A marginal access street or frontage road in a subdivision shall be provided parallel and adjacent to the boundary of rights-of-way of railroads, limited access freeways and major traffic thoroughfares; however, a street may be provided at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such street and such rights-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separation or for lot depths.

(f) Half-Streets. Dedication of half-streets will not be approved except where such streets are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity with other requirements of this division.

(g) Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that this requirement may be waived where other definite and assured provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided wherever possible, but if unavoidable, such dead-end alleys may be approved if adequate turnaround facilities are provided at the closed end. (Code 1981 § 41-93. Code 1995 § 134-135.)

(3) All fees shall be deposited in the city’s parkland acquisition and development fund by planning area. Fees collected shall be used for the acquisition and improvement of new or undeveloped parkland within the same planning area as which the fee is collected, including the improvement of undeveloped land within existing parkland.

(4)(i) Except as described in subsection (c)(4)(ii) of this section, upon application of the property owner, the county shall refund that portion of any parkland development fee which has been on deposit over seven years and which is unexpended and uncommitted. The refund shall be made to the then-current owner or owners of lots or units of the development project or projects.

(ii) If fees in any parkland development fee account are unexpended or uncommitted for more than six calendar years after deposit, the county commission shall make findings by resolution on or before December 31st of the sixth calendar year after receipt of the fee and annually thereafter until the funds are expended or committed. For so long as the county retains the fees, the resolution shall identify the purpose to which such fees shall be put and to show a roughly proportional and reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was collected. If the county commission makes such findings, the fees are exempt from the refund requirement.

(d) Credit for Parkland Dedications. Developers may dedicate a portion of their land for public parkland. In such instances where parkland is accepted for dedication, a credit equal to $15,000 per acre, or fraction thereof, of dedicated parkland shall be applied against the balance of parkland acquisition costs required under this section for the subdivision. Provided, however, such dedication shall not reduce the payment for parkland improvement costs as reflected in the minimum fee schedule listed in subsection (c)(2) of this section.

(e) Credit for Parkland Improvements in a Benefit District. In addition to dedicating a portion of their land, developers may also petition the city to include the cost of public parkland improvements within a benefit district for the service area. Where such dedication occurs and public parkland is approved for inclusion in a benefit district, a credit equal to 100 percent of the required parkland improvement cost defined under this section shall be applied to the subdivision within the benefit district.

(f) Dedication Criteria. The parks and recreation director, after consultation with the planning director, shall determine the suitability of the land for parkland, and determine any improvements required to bring the land into usable condition. Factors to be considered in evaluating potential parkland sites shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

(1) All land proposed for dedication as a park or other recreational site shall contain a minimum of five acres.

(2) Not more than 10 percent of the park or open space shall contain stormwater detention/retention facilities, floodplain, or wetland, unless such area is part of a linear trail system, or is accepted by the parks and recreation director.

(3) The park or open space shall not have an average slope greater than 10 percent.

(4) Undisturbed natural open space may be accepted for a portion of the dedication requirements at the ratio of four acres of undisturbed natural open space, for each one acre of active parkland dedication.

(5) The parks and recreation director shall have the authority to waive or modify any or all of the above listed criteria.

(6) The park or open space shall be consistent with design policies/standards of the city’s comprehensive plan.

(g) Trail Dedication. Where the Topeka-Shawnee County trails and greenways plan identifies a trail planned for an area within a proposed subdivision, the property owner or developer shall be required to dedicate that portion of land for a public trail easement or trail right-of-way. Any such dedication shall receive a credit as specified in subsection (d) of this section.

(h) Other Considerations Prior to Deeding. The parks and recreation director may require that any dedicated parkland be improved prior to dedication. Factors that may be considered shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

(1) To the greatest extent possible, the developer may be required to preserve existing trees or other species of vegetation, or other natural features on the land to be dedicated for a park, trail, or recreational space. Significant trees lost during the construction process may be required to be replaced with suitable species and of suitable size as determined by the parks and recreation director.

(2) Grass or other quick establishing vegetative ground cover may be required to prevent soil erosion, according to the specifications determined by the parks and recreation director.

(3) The developer may be required to bring utilities to the boundary of the proposed park or open space and shall cap them off at no cost to the city. Utilities may include, but shall not be limited to, gas, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, and electricity. The location where such utilities are to be brought shall be determined by the city engineer and the parks and recreation director.

(i) Dedication Process.

(1) Land to be accepted as a park or trail under this section shall be designated as public park area or trail on the final plat.

(2) Prior to the dedication of parkland, the owner or developer shall provide the county with evidence of title in a form acceptable to the Shawnee County counselor or a title insurance policy insuring the county’s interest in the property. In any dedication of required land, the developer must have good and marketable title to the land, free and clear of any mortgages, liens, encumbrances, or assessments, except easements or minor imperfections of the title acceptable to the county.

(3) The parkland or trail shall be dedicated at the time of approval of the final plat. However, the county shall not accept the parkland or trail until the completion of required improvements and the approval of the parks and recreation director.

(j) Credit for Private Open Space. Property owners or developers may choose to reserve a portion of a subdivision for use as private open space for the benefit of subdivision residents. In such instances, a credit of 25 percent shall be applied against the parkland development fee as required by this division. All land proposed for reservation as private open space must be deemed usable and accessible by all residents within the proposed subdivision, as determined by the planning director, and approved by the planning commission. (Ord. 19715 § 2, 3-20-12.)

18.40.140 Adopted plans.

Subdivisions shall meet the design standards and development policies contained in the adopted elements of the comprehensive plan for the city of Topeka, including, but not limited to, the land use and growth management plan, the transportation plan, and the neighborhood plan elements adopted for the various areas of the city of Topeka. (Ord. 18266 § 7, 6-15-04. Code 1995 § 134-201.)


18.40.150 Stream buffers.

(a) Purpose. The creation and maintenance of stream buffers benefits the environment by protecting water quality and riparian ecosystems. This section shall, to the greatest extent possible, incorporate the city’s stream buffer requirements contained in TMC 17.10.010, et seq.

(b) Definitions. The terms, words and phrases used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to them in TMC 17.10.020.

(c) Plat Requirements.

(1) All plats prepared for recording shall clearly:

(i) Show the extent of any buffer on the subject property by metes and bounds.

(ii) Label the buffer.

(iii) Provide a restriction stating, “There shall be no clearing, grading, construction or disturbance of vegetation except as permitted under TMC 17.10.060 or as approved by the public works director or his or her designee.”

(2) The public works director and planning director may mutually adopt administrative guidelines that more specifically illustrate text and graphics to be contained on the plat as referenced in this subsection.

(3) A dedication of a stream buffer area to the city shall not be interpreted to mean that this conveys to the general public the right of access to this area.

(4) Stream buffers situated adjacent to public streets add value to neighborhoods. In order to provide an incentive to locate buffers adjacent to public streets, the city will allow the dedicated right-of-way width as contained in the city’s design criteria adjacent to the improved street to be included within the outer zone of the stream buffer. Also, the city may through its platting process accept the dedication of buffer areas located adjacent to streets and maintain the same as public property. (Ord. 19430 § 5, 6-15-10.)

Whenever there is to be a change in general use classification of any building or land subsequent to the effective date of these regulations the same shall only be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of these regulations and in a district in which it is permitted. All existing structures or buildings, the use of which is in accordance with the use regulations of the district in which they are located, are hereby declared to be in conformity with the dimensional requirements of the assigned district herein upon the date of adoption of these regulations. Provided further, all single-family dwelling buildings, existing as legal conforming uses, upon the adoption of these regulations and the use of which is not in accordance with the use regulations of the assigned district in which they are located, may be enlarged, structurally altered, and accessory structures erected, and are hereby declared to be in conformity with the dimensional requirements herein upon the date of adoption of these regulations.

NOTES:

[1] If the recorded plat of subdivision provides greater setbacks, the provisions of the plat shall prevail.

[2] The side yard of a corner lot and rear yard of a double frontage lot shall conform to the minimum front yard requirements of its district.

[3] In RR-1 district, the minimum lot size is 20 acres unless the lot meets minimum compliance with subdivision regulations.

[4] In R-3 district: First number represents front setback when an attached garage is designed for side entry. Second number represents front setback when attached garage is designed for front entry.

[5] In R-3 district: District allows zero-foot side yard setback on one side; 10-foot on other side with a minimum of 10 feet between principal buildings. Accessory buildings for a zero lot line dwelling shall not be located in the required 10-foot side yard.

[6] For single-family attached dwellings in M districts, a zero-foot side yard setback is allowed along the lot line separating the two units; a five-foot setback is required on the other lot line.

[7] In M-1 and M-1a districts, the minimum lot area of 4,500 square feet is “per unit.”

[8] Accessory structures shall not be located within a required front yard or beyond the front face of the principal structure, whichever is more restrictive. However, a minimum setback of 20 feet from all street rights-of-way shall be provided for roadside stands, garages and carports. If, in the judgment of the planning director, construction of a roadside stand, garage or carport is compatible with the neighborhood, in respect to availability of land for public sidewalks, right-of-way needs, and the location of structures within the block, then such construction may occur with revised minimum setback(s) as determined by the planning director.

[9] An unenclosed carport located less than six feet from the principal building may extend to within three feet of a side property line.

[10] Setback from Principal Building. No portion of an accessory building, except for a carport, shall be located closer than six feet to the principal building or another accessory building on the same lot. However, an unenclosed breezeway may be extended between the principal structure and the accessory structure for the purpose of providing a covered walkway. In no event shall the construction of a covered walkway or a detached carport located next to another building be deemed to join the principal and accessory structures into one principal structure.

[11] Maximum Height. Accessory buildings and structures shall not exceed 15 feet when the principal building is one story or 20 feet when the principal building is two stories or more.

[12] Reverse Corner Lot. On a reversed corner lot in a residential district, and within 15 feet of any adjacent property to the rear in a residential district, no detached accessory building or portion thereof located in a required rear yard shall be closer to the side lot line abutting the street than a distance equal to the least depth which would be required under this division for the front yard on such adjacent property to the rear. Further, in the above instance, all such accessory buildings shall meet the minimum side yard requirements of such adjacent property which coincides with the side lot line or portion thereof of property in any residential district.

[13] Attached Accessory Buildings. Attached accessory buildings, except for side yards for carports as outlined above, shall be located pursuant to the requirements for principal buildings. Attached garages and carports shall be located on a lot so that a minimum 20-foot-length “aisle” between the building and the street right-of-way line is provided.

[14] The minimum lot area in the R-4 district is the combined area needed for 10 contiguous lots.

NOTES:

[1] If the recorded plat of subdivision provides greater setbacks, the provisions of the plat shall prevail.

[2] The side yard of a corner lot and rear yard of a double frontage lot shall conform to the minimum front yard requirements of the district.

[3] During site plan review, side yard setbacks may be reduced to zero feet where the buildings are attached along a common lot line.

[4] Accessory structures shall not be located within a required front yard or beyond the front face of the principal structure, whichever is more restrictive. However, a minimum setback of 20 feet from all street rights-of-way shall be provided for garages and carports. If, in the judgment of the planning director, construction of a garage or carport is compatible with the neighborhood, in respect to availability of land for public sidewalks, right-of-way needs, and the location of structures within the block, then such construction may occur with revised minimum setback(s) as determined by the planning director.

[5] Height restrictions of airport overlay district may be more restrictive.

[6] Height shall not exceed the height of its principal structure.

NOTES:

[1] If the recorded plat of subdivision provides greater setbacks, the provisions of the plat shall prevail.

[2] The side yard of a corner lot and rear yard of a double frontage lot shall conform to the minimum front yard requirements of the district.

[3] Height restrictions of airport overlay district may be more restrictive.

[4] I districts: 10-foot rear or seven-foot side yard setback where that yard abuts any residential dwelling district.

[5] I districts: Where the frontage along one side of the street in that block abuts a residential district, then the front yard requirements of the residential district shall apply.

[6] U-1 district: Minimum yard requirements and maximum height shall be in accordance with the approved master development plan.

[7] MS-1 district: The side setbacks are five feet for buildings up to 50 feet in height and 10 feet for buildings taller than 50 feet in height.

[8] MS-1 district: Any other building or structure that is not a hospital shall not exceed a height of 100 feet; however, if located within 150 feet of the boundary of the district, it shall not exceed a height of 50 feet.

[9] X districts: Setbacks with a range are determined at the discretion of the planning director.

[10] X-2 district: Side and rear yard setbacks may be reduced if not abutting residential uses, as determined at the discretion of the planning director.

[11] Accessory structures shall not be located within a required front yard or beyond the front face of the principal structure, whichever is more restrictive. However, a minimum setback of 20 feet from all street rights-of-way shall be provided for roadside stands, garages and carports. If, in the judgment of the planning director, construction of a roadside stand, garage or carport is compatible with the neighborhood, in respect to availability of land for public sidewalks, right-of-way needs, and the location of structures within the block, then such construction may occur with revised minimum setback(s) as determined by the planning director. If more restrictive than provided above, setbacks as set forth by plats of subdivision shall apply to any and all accessory structures.

[12] Setback from Principal Building. No portion of an accessory building, except for a carport, shall be located closer than six feet to the principal building or another accessory building on the same lot. However, an unenclosed breezeway may be extended between the principal structure and the accessory structure for the purpose of providing a covered walkway. In no event shall the construction of a covered walkway or a detached carport located next to another building be deemed to join the principal and accessory structures into one principal structure.

[13] Maximum Height. In the MS-1, X, and D-2 districts, accessory buildings and structures shall not exceed 15 feet when the principal building is one story or 20 feet when the principal building is two stories or more.

[14] The accessory building (detached) side and rear setbacks only apply to residential uses in the X and MS-1 districts.

[15] An unenclosed carport located less than six feet from the principal building may extend to within three feet of a side property line.

[16] (i) In D-1 district, no building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall exceed a height at the street line which is greater than the width of the street right-of-way times a factor of three. On corner lots, and where the widths of the two intersecting streets are varied, the larger street width shall be used to determine the height of any building or structure.

(ii) Exception. Within the state zoning area, as defined by K.S.A. 75-3620, the height of structures and buildings shall be regulated in accordance with the following provisions: no building shall exceed a height at the street line of six stories or 75 feet, but above the height permitted at the street line three feet may be added to the height of the building for each one foot that the building or portion thereof is set back from all sides of the lot, except that the cubical contents of such building shall not exceed the cubical contents of a prism having a base equal to the area of the lot and a height equal to two times the width of the street; provided, however, that a tower with a base not to exceed 20 percent of lot area not to have any side greater than 60 feet nor to have any wall closer than 20 feet to any lot line may be constructed without reference to the above limitations. Any applicable provisions of Chapter 18.225 TMC shall apply to buildings erected in this district.

[17] D-1 district: Refer to Downtown Topeka Urban Design Guidelines.

There are three classifications of mixed use districts as follows:

(a) X-1 Mixed Use District. This district facilitates a compatible mixed use activity center within a traditional residential neighborhood and, to a limited extent, in areas envisioned for mixed use development by the comprehensive plan. The district includes a balance of compatible residential, office, civic, and neighborhood commercial retail/service uses of low to moderate intensity that complement and support dense neighborhood residential areas and pedestrian usage with quality urban design.

(b) X-2 Mixed Use District. This district facilitates a mixed use area that transitions from a higher intensity industrial use area to lower intensity neighborhood-scale residential areas and includes a balance of compatible residential, office, commercial service, and light industrial uses.

(c) X-3 Mixed Use District. This district facilitates a destination-oriented mixed use district in the area known as the North Crossings area of North Topeka that serves as the northern entertainment/cultural anchor of downtown. The objectives of the district include:

(1) Improving the area as a 24-hour destination for urban, cultural, entertainment, community, and residential experiences; and

(2) Retention and attraction of businesses, workplaces and residences through adaptive reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings as a preference; and

(3) Redeveloping vacant and under-utilized properties through appropriately scaled in-fill development; and

(4) High quality development and urban design standards that maintain a sense of history, human scale, and pedestrian orientation. (Ord. 20062 § 23, 4-18-17.)

(a) The X districts shall only be permitted on an area-wide basis as designated by a specific land use policy set forth in the comprehensive plan for that area. The X district shall be identified as an area that merits special design considerations, involving a variety of property owners and uses within a developed urban environment. The X district shall be sufficiently cohesive and substantial to achieve a common objective as identified in the comprehensive plan.

(b) The procedure for amending the district map to include X mixed use districts shall be in accordance with the procedures of TMC 18.245.020.

(c) Properties in the X districts may be allowed more than one principal structure per zoning lot and more than one use per building. (Ord. 20062 § 24, 4-18-17.)

18.190.010 Purpose – Intent.

This district is established to permit greater flexibility and more creative, innovative and imaginative design for the development of areas that are generally not possible under the strict application of the regulations of the other districts. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land while providing for a pleasing and harmonious development and environment, including opportunities to provide for a high level of urban amenities, and the preservation of open spaces. The regulations of this district are intended to encourage the use of this district in order to integrate multiple uses into the development; to adapt the proposed use(s) to meet the conditions of the site; and to affect certain economics in public facilities.

Due to the nature and implications of a district zone which provides for such a broad spectrum of land use and a more challenging responsibility of the delivery of public services, considerations and quasijudicial deliberations relating to the compatibility of the district to a particular site shall permit greater discretionary review and broad latitude in applying conditions and limitations for a permitted development. The compliance with all standards set forth in this division and the submittal of all specified documents and data shall not entitle an applicant to this district classification. (Ord. 19997 § 1, 5-3-16.)


18.190.020 Regulations generally.

The regulations set forth in this chapter or set forth elsewhere in this title when referred to in this chapter are the district regulations for the PUD planned unit development district. A development plan shall not be inconsistent with the following general standards for use of land, and the use, type, bulk, design and location of buildings, the density or intensity of use, the common open space, the public facilities and the development by geographic division of the site as well as with the surrounding or adjacent properties.

One or more use groups, referring to one or more of the zoning districts, shall be established on the master plan. The use regulations, dimensional requirements, off-street parking regulations and sign regulations for each of the use groups shall be as set forth in each of the corresponding zoning districts contained in this code, unless other requirements are specifically set forth on the master plan or the site plan. (Ord. 19218 § 1, 2-3-09. Code 1995 § 48-24.01.)


18.190.030 Use regulations.

(a) Permitted Uses. A planned unit development district may provide for any use or combination of uses that are listed in the use regulations of the various districts contained in this division, subject to applicable limitations, provisions or conditions specified therein and in accordance with the following regulations:

(1) All approved permitted uses of this district shall be geographically designated and grouped by category on all plans in like manner as other districts contained in this division, either by individual group or in combination therewith.

(2) Permitted use categories and any approved conditional uses provided by the individual categories shall be specifically designated on all approved plans and shall be set forth in the adopting ordinance or resolution.

(3) Provided, that all applicable limitations, provisions and conditions specified by use and set forth in this district are complied with, there may be use changes or relocations within each group category; provided, that the approved plan is not modified except as otherwise provided for by the procedures of this district.

(b) Setback and Height Regulations. The height and front, side and rear yard setbacks for individual structures within the planned unit development shall be determined in conjunction with the final approval of the planned unit development plan.

(c) Off-Street Parking Regulations. The provisions of Chapter 18.240 TMC, Off-Street Parking Requirements, shall apply to the planned unit development district in all respects except for the specified standards establishing the required number of spaces. Off-street parking regulations shall be based on the applicable requirements for each proposed use as set forth in this code. The planning director can provide a downward variance from this requirement based on factors provided by the applicant, including, but not limited to, the use of shared parking, nearby public parking or other factors that justify a lesser parking requirement.

(d) Signs. The number, location, size, area, height and type of signs shall be determined in conjunction with the approval process. (Ord. 19218 § 2, 2-3-09. Code 1995 § 48-24.02.)

18.190.040 Requirements and development standards for the planned unit development district.

The following performance criteria shall be required of all planned unit developments and shall be addressed by the master plan:

(a) Size of Parcel.

(1) One Acre. Except as provided in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the minimum site size for a planned unit development district shall be one acre.

(2) Less Than One Acre. 

(i) Less Than One Acre – Transition Area. Parcels containing less than one acre may be reclassified to a planned unit development district where the planning director determines the proposed PUD to be a “transition area,” defined as an area that separates a nonresidential use group classification (O&I, C, or I districts alone or within a PUD) from another nonresidential use group classification or a residential use group classification (R or M districts alone or within a PUD). The determination of the planning director may be appealed to the planning commission.

(ii) Less Than One Acre – Reuse of Building – Zoning Change. Parcels containing less than one acre may be reclassified to a planned unit development district where the plan includes a reuse of an existing building and the proposed use would require a zoning change to a less restrictive classification. Conditional uses may be allowed as indicated in TMC 18.190.030(a)(2).

(b) Additional Standards and Requirements for Projects on Less Than One Acre.

(1) The use group category assignment of the planned unit development will be compatible with surrounding properties in the neighborhood. Restrictions may be imposed to ensure the proposed use is compatible with surrounding properties or uses.

(2) The density and design of the planned unit development shall be compatible in use, size and type of structure, relative amount of open space, traffic circulation and general layout with adjoining land use, and shall be integrated into the neighborhood.

(3) The development shall not have any greater impact on existing streets and utilities than that anticipated for a conventional development of the site.

(4) The development shall not adversely affect views, light and air, and use and enjoyment of neighboring properties any more than would a conventional development.

(5) The master planned unit development plan shall also include building elevations for all structures and details of materials to be used for external construction, when determined necessary by the planning director. The determination of the planning director may be appealed to the planning commission.

(c) Property Owners’ Association. Areas within the planned unit development which are designated as private streets, private utility services, common areas, recreation areas, or other open space set aside for the benefit of tenants and property owners, shall be maintained by the property owners’ association or, in the alternative, property owners within the planned unit development. In the event the property owners’ association or property owners within the planned unit development fail to maintain such areas, the governing body may proceed under applicable ordinances and/or resolutions to maintain such areas. All costs incurred by the governing body in maintaining such areas shall be assessed against the lots within the planned unit development as provided for by law. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as creating a duty on behalf of the governing body to enforce any of the duties, obligations, or responsibilities of the property owners’ association or, in the alternative, individual property owners.

(d) Platting. Building or zoning permits shall not be issued nor any development initiated on any property designated as planned unit development until such time that the property has been platted as a subdivision; or replatted as a subdivision when determined by the planning director that conditions and circumstances relating to utility extension and service, street or alley right-of-way, topographic and drainage factors, easements, or vehicular access warrant said replat.

(e) Access.

(1) All drives, lanes, streets, culs-de-sac, and other accessways within the planned unit development shall be owned and maintained by the property owners’ association or owners within the planned unit development unless it is determined by the planning commission that there is a public need for local streets and/or major trafficways to transverse the district. In such instances, the transversing streets and/or trafficway right-of-way shall be dedicated by the developer in accordance with the plat subdivision regulations.

(2) All drives, lanes, streets, culs-de-sac and other privately owned accessways providing accessibility to individual structures, buildings, and uses within the planned unit development shall, by the nature and intent of the district, be considered and serve as mutual rights of access for owners, tenants, invited guests, clients, customers, support and utility service personnel and emergency service providers, including law enforcement, fire protection and ambulance services. No gates, structures or other barriers shall be constructed across said accessways which may impede, limit, or restrict the above rights of access.

(3) The site will be accessible from public streets which are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development. Streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents, occupants, or users of the proposed development. Traffic control signals will be provided without expense to the city when such signals are required to prevent traffic hazards or congestion in adjacent streets.

(4) All drives, lanes, streets, culs-de-sac, accessways, and parking lots shall comply with all applicable provisions of Chapter 18.240 TMC in respect to surfacing, design, screening, lighting, and drainage.

(f) Other Standards. Other developmental standards, requirements, and provisions of applicable jurisdictional units including but not limited to those of public works, fire and water district, law enforcement, utilities, and parks and recreation, and which may not be specifically set forth in this division, shall apply and the master and final planned unit development plans should account for such and reflect a development design accordingly; provided, that variances and waivers are not granted by the appropriate authority. (Ord. 19997 § 2, 5-3-16.)

18.190.060 Planned unit development approval by the governing body.

(a) Form of Ordinance. An ordinance approving a planned unit development and establishing a planned unit development district shall specify the restrictions that will, pursuant to the development plan, apply in the planned development district and shall describe the boundaries of such district or set such boundaries out on a map that is incorporated and published as a part of such document. Such document shall also specify the conditions and restrictions that have been imposed by the governing body on the planned development and shall designate geographic areas by use group category. Prior to consideration of an ordinance by the city council, the applicant shall submit the plan on a permanent-type drafting film material on sheets 24 inches by 36 inches suitable for recording.

(b) Recording. For those proposals which are approved to be reclassified to the planned unit development district, the master plan, and site plan (if concurrent approval is requested by the applicant) as approved by the governing body with all conditions, revisions, and restrictions as set forth or imposed by said action of the governing body shall be recorded within 60 days of the action date of the city council by the applicant with the register of deeds. Failure by the applicant to record the plan within the prescribed time period or provide the planning department 15 copies of the recorded plan within 90 days of the action by the governing body shall deem the zoning petition as null and void. The planning director upon written request of the applicant and for good cause shown may extend this time period an additional 30 days. Upon recordation, any changes, revisions, or modifications to the plan shall be in accordance with this division and again recorded in a similar manner; provided, however, if the cause of the delay was one of circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, the planning director may grant an additional extension of 90 days.

(c) Site Development Plan Review. If the site plan was not submitted and approved concurrently with the master plan, the following procedure shall apply: following the recording of the master planned unit development plan and prior to application for any building development on the site, the applicant shall be required to submit a site development plan in accordance with the procedures set forth as follows:

(1) Submission of Site Development Plan.

18.190.070 Amendments to planned unit development plans.

Each applicant petitioning for a planned unit development district shall, as part of the application, designate a prescribed manner as to who may initiate amendment(s) to the approved planned unit development master plan. In addition to the planning commission or city council, the owner may solely initiate amendments to the plan. The terms and provisions of the plan shall extend to and be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, trustees, and assignees of the owner. Should more than one entity hold title, then all such affected owners of all such title as determined by the planning director shall be required to execute any such amendment. In lieu of all owners individually executing such document, the planning director may approve a homeowners’ or property owners’ association to execute any such amendment if they present evidence their organization has the authority to represent all owners within the PUD.

(a) Minor Amendments to Master Plan. Minor changes to a planned unit development master plan may be approved administratively, if at all, by the planning director. Such changes may be authorized without additional public hearings, at the discretion of the planning director. This provision shall not prohibit the planning director from requesting a recommendation from the planning commission.

(1) Minor Amendment Criteria. Amendments shall be deemed as minor if the cumulative revisions to the most recent approved master plan of record which was considered at a public hearing do not include:

(i) A change to the use and character of the development.

(ii) The possible creation of obstacles, barriers and service problems to traffic circulation, fire protection, public safety, and public utility services due to the revision(s).

(iii) A reduction by greater than 10 percent of the designated open space.

(iv) An increase by greater than 10 percent in the approved number of residential dwelling units.

(v) Increase the floor area proposed for nonresidential use by more than 10 percent.

(vi) Increase by greater than 20 percent the approved signage including, but not limited to, height or sign face area.

(2) Submittal of Revised Master Plan with Minor Amendments. The proposed revised master plan shall be submitted to the planning director for consideration of approval. Said plan shall be presented on reproducible tracing material in like manner, and substance as reflected on the most recent approved plan. All other data, conditions, and information other than that proposed for amendment shall be identical to the most recently approved plan. Space for acknowledgement of approval by the planning director with date space shall be reflected on said plan. A letter of transmittal from the designated applicant setting forth in detail all proposed amendments shall accompany the submittal. Upon approval of any revised plan, the applicant shall furnish 16 copies of such plan with the planning agency for distribution to public agencies and utilities. The original tracing will remain on file in the planning agency and the revised master plan shall be rerecorded with the register of deeds in like manner as established with the original filing.

(b) Major Amendments to Master Plan. Major changes shall include any modifications that do not meet all the minor amendment criteria set forth above. A major amendment is processed and approved in the same manner as the original application. Amendments that add a permitted use group and/or change the location of a use group by legal description are subject to protest as provided for under state law for any other rezoning. (Ord. 19218 § 6, 2-3-09. Code 1995 § 48-24.06.)

	EXHIBIT A 

DOWNTOWN TOPEKA URBAN DESIGN GUIDELINES 

	PURPOSE	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 

	The purpose of these guidelines is to provide the regulatory authority to ensure that new construction and renovation of existing structures is consistent with the established urban form of downtown. These guidelines are to be used as criteria for the design of new public and private projects and to be utilized in the evaluation of new projects. These guidelines seek to balance private property rights against the public interest of protecting the appearance and existing investments downtown.	
[IMAGE]


	The design guidelines offer a vision for an approach to downtown design that can be beneficial both to developers and to the community. The concepts for downtown development encourage the highest level of design quality and creativity while emphasizing key downtown design concepts such as, but not limited to:

	•	Maintaining the street wall at the front property line;

	•	Enhancing the design of street facades;

	•	Ensuring pedestrian compatibility;

	•	Designing public spaces at a pedestrian scale;

	•	Creating visual interest; and

	•	Maintaining design integrity and compatibility with surrounding structures.

	A mix of uses (including office, retail, housing, or other uses) within a given project is encouraged, whether it is a single building or a redevelopment district.

	APPLICABILITY

	These guidelines apply to the D zoning districts with the exception of projects located within designated historic districts or individually listed historic properties. For these exceptions, projects must follow the applicable design guidelines or other standards that specifically govern alterations to those properties in place of these guidelines. Within the boundaries of the D zoning district’s designated National Register Historic Districts, these guidelines are amended by separate design guidelines as adopted. Any project requiring a building permit must comply with approved design guidelines.

	The guidelines established herein are not intended to restrict creative solutions. These guidelines describe ways to achieve the stated purpose of the guidelines and offer flexibility in meeting the key concepts for good downtown design. Not all guidelines will or are intended to be met. The “should,” “recommended,” or “encouraged” statements offer flexibility and indicate that the city is open to design features that are equal to or better than those stated, so long as the intent is satisfied.

	Compliance with the guidelines will be determined in conjunction with the review and approval of a development site plan, all in accordance with site plan regulations. Submission of plans for all elevations of a proposed building is required.

	WAIVER/EXCEPTION

	Relief from the application of certain design guidelines may be granted by the planning director if warranted by public safety, site constraints, and functionality considerations.

	DEFINITIONS

	If in the course of administration of these guidelines, a question arises as to the meaning of any word, phrase, or section, the planning director shall determine the interpretation.

	INFILL DEVELOPMENT

	1.	Exterior additions to existing buildings or adjacent infill construction should be compatible with the character of the site, and take into account the size, proportions, facade composition, rhythm and proportion of openings, materials, and colors of neighboring buildings. Techniques to help ensure compatibility with neighboring buildings include:

	 	•	Maintaining the street wall by locating the new building at the sidewalk;

	 	•	Ensuring the street level facade fits in contextually with neighboring properties;

	 	•	Differentiating the upper stories of the building from the street level facade by setting back the upper stories at the plane above the street level facade; and

	 	•	Using different wall materials than the lower facade.

	2.	New on-site parking, loading docks or ramps should be designed to be unobtrusive and compatible with the primary use of the site. On-site parking should not be located along or adjacent to the street frontage. In those instances where parking is located along a street frontage, efforts to maintain the street wall will be imperative. Options include landscaping, low walls, etc.

	STREET ORIENTATION

	1.	Buildings should generally be built up to the edge of the sidewalk in a consistent plan with the other buildings on the street.	
[IMAGE]


	2.	Other street-level setbacks, plazas and widened sidewalks from the building line should be strategically placed in accordance with an overall open space plan. The new open spaces should be located to relate to other land uses such as retail, entertainment and transit routes.

	STREET LEVEL FORM

	1.	The street frontage of buildings should contain public or semi-public uses such as commercial, office, retail or entertainment uses with direct entry from the street. Non-public/semi-public uses are appropriate on the first floor if located to the rear of the street frontage use.	
[IMAGE]


	2.	New buildings should express a principal public facade and entrance on the adjacent street, and entries from parking facilities should be considered as secondary.

	3.	Retail activities within buildings should be oriented towards the street and have direct access from sidewalks through storefront entries.

	4.	Ground floor storefront restaurants are encouraged to have a strong connection between the interior of the structure and the exterior street environments.

	5.	Upper floor balconies should not extend structural supports into the public right-of-way below.

	6.	Sidewalk cafes should not impair pedestrian circulation nor store entrance access. There should be at least a six-foot contiguous and unobstructed walkway for use by pedestrians.

	BUILDINGS FACADES	
[IMAGE]


	1.	New buildings should be open and inviting in both their principal and secondary facades. Blank walls, or any wall with less than 30 percent glass, should not be placed along public streets, but may be placed along alleys and service lanes.

	2.	Entryways should be generously proportioned and visually transparent so as to encourage connections to the public realm.	
[IMAGE]


	3.	Decorative and functional elements such as signage, awnings, and ornamentation should be used to create human scale elements on the street-level facades to further encourage openness.

	4.	Loading docks and garage entrances should not be located on the major pedestrian street side of new buildings.

	5.	New curb cuts that conflict with safe pedestrian travel and existing on-street parking are discouraged.	
[IMAGE]


	6.	Retail storefronts are strongly encouraged along the ground floor of all new and renovated buildings. These should be visually transparent to the interior with large areas of window display and should provide for direct entry from the sidewalk. The rhythm of windows and storefronts should be consistent.

	PARKING FACILITY DESIGN

	1.	Facades of parking facilities should be treated with an architectural finish and given vertical articulation and emphasis. The facade should distinguish a base, middle and top by using different materials, or other methods, and also respond to the context of surrounding buildings by using similar materials. The facade should be designed so as to visually screen cars at street level. Sloping interior floors should not be visible or expressed on the exterior face of the building.	
[IMAGE]


 

	2.	Retail storefronts or other business uses should be placed at the street level along the principal street and are encouraged along all adjacent streets except service alleys.

	3.	Pedestrian entries should be clearly visible and architecturally expressed on the exterior of the garage. Expression of the vertical pedestrian circulation (stairs and elevators) on the exterior of the garage is encouraged.

	4.	Surface parking lots should provide landscaping in compliance with Topeka’s landscape ordinance. Required landscaping should take the form of planter strips, landscaped areas and perimeter landscaping.	
[IMAGE]


	5.	The existing street setback should be maintained along the principal street frontage in developed areas and established in new districts or developments. Tools for accomplishing this can include walls, fences, row of trees, hedges or any combination of these elements. The height and placement of such features should be in accordance with CPTED (crime prevention through environmental design) principles.

	6.	While it is important to provide adequate interior lighting for safety and comfort, it should be controlled to avoid spill out on the adjacent streets creating excessive glare.

	ARCHITECTURE AND CONTEXT

	1.	The architectural design of new buildings and the rehabilitation of existing buildings should be sensitive to the existing built and natural environment within which they are constructed. The architecture of the existing downtown buildings should provide examples of architectural themes, rhythm, materials and forms.

	
[IMAGE]


	2.	New construction is not required to implement any particular architectural style, but should be designed to be compatible with the scale, form and materials of surrounding structures, by applying these guidelines. 

	PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

	1.	All new public infrastructure projects (roads, sidewalks, public buildings, and streetlights) should meet high standards of design quality and provide significant secondary benefits in the form of major public space improvements. These projects should be subject to the same standards of Downtown design that would be required of all other projects.	
[IMAGE]


	2.	Public art projects are encouraged to be incorporated into every major public infrastructure project such as bridges, highways and roadways.	
[IMAGE]


	PUBLIC SPACES

	1.	New public spaces should consist of renovated or enhanced streets, or strategically selected places that are directly linked to the street system.	
[IMAGE]


	2.	Generally, pedestrian ways should not be separated from streets and sidewalks, unless in riverfront parks. They should maintain direct access from the adjacent streets. They should be open along the adjacent sidewalk and allow for multiple points of entry. A passerby should be able to see directly into the space.

	3.	New public spaces should be developed with pedestrian amenities, such as follows:	 	 	
[IMAGE]


	•	Landscaping.	 	 

	•	Open space.	 	 

	•	Seating.	 	 

	•	Public art.	 	 

	•	However, walls, fences and dense planting that visually seclude the interior space from the sidewalk should be avoided.	 	 

	HISTORY AND IDENTITY

	1.	All projects are encouraged to express local history and identity through functional and ornamental design elements and works of public art.	
[IMAGE]


	2.	New development projects or renovation of existing structures should be designed to preserve the historic resources that exist on the site and reinforce the historical context within which they are developed.

	3.	In the event that it is not possible to preserve the entirety of a historic building the retention of historic facades is encouraged.

	STREET AND BLOCK ORGANIZATION

	1.	New buildings and development should respect the existing organization of the city and the street and block patterns that exist.

	2.	Superblock developments that join together one or more blocks are discouraged.

	3.	Where it is feasible, street grids should be extended, reestablished or newly created in areas of large-scale redevelopment.

	4.	New buildings or pedestrian bridges should not bridge across or block access to existing streets.

	ENTRANCES AND VISTAS

	1.	Buildings and new development projects should be sensitively designed and sited so as to preserve the key vistas and gateways to downtown and views of the State Capitol.

	2.	New buildings should not block the view corridors defined by the city streets, either by bridging across streets or the use of pedestrian bridges.

18.205.010 Short title.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as “Forbes Field and Philip Billard Airports hazard zoning.” (Code 1981 § 4-55. Code 1995 § 22-26.)


18.205.020 Definitions.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

“Airport” means the Forbes Field Airport and the Philip Billard Airport.

“Airport elevation” means the highest point of an airport’s usable landing area measured in feet from mean sea level.

“Airport hazard” means any structure or object of natural growth located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use of land near such airport, which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or takeoff at such airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or takeoff of aircraft.

Approach, Transitional, Horizontal and Conical Zones. These zones apply to the area under the approach, transitional, horizontal and conical surfaces defined in Federal Aviation Regulation Part 77.

“Board of zoning appeals” means a board consisting of not less than three nor more than seven members appointed by the board of county commissioners or the mayor of the city.

Height. For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this chapter and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.

“Nonconforming use” means any preexisting structure, object of natural growth, or use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter or any amendment thereto.

“Nonprecision instrument runway” means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area-type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in nonprecision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned, and for which no precision approach facilities are planned or indicated on an FAA planning document or military service’s military airport planning document.

“Person” means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association or governmental entity. It includes a trustee, receiver, assignee or similar representative of any of them.

“Precision instrument runway” means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an instrument landing system (ILS) or a precision approach radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated on an FAA-approved airport layout plan or a military service’s military airport planning document.

“Primary surface” means a surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; but when the runway has no specially prepared hard surface, or planned hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway.

The width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.

“Runway” means a defined area of an airport prepared for the landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length.

“Structure” means an object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, earth formations and overhead transmission lines.

“Tree” means any object of natural growth.

“Utility runway” means a runway that is constructed for an intended use by propeller-driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and less.

“Visual runway” means a runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA-approved airport layout plan, a military service’s approved military airport layout plan, or by a planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority. (Code 1981 § 4-56. Code 1995 § 22-27.)

18.205.030 Airport zones established.

(a) Zones Defined. In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones, and conical zones as they apply to a particular airport. Such zones are shown on the airport hazard zoning map prepared by the Metropolitan Topeka Airport Authority which is attached to Ordinance No. 14650 and made a part of this chapter by reference. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:

(1) Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of the utility runway visual approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

(2) Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

(3) Runway Larger Than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater Than Three-Fourths-Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

(4) Runway Larger Than Utility with a Visibility Minimum as Low as Three-Fourths-Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

(5) Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of the precision instrument runway approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.

(6) Transitional Zones. Transitional zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at a 90-degree angle to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach and at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.

(7) Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface to each runway. The radius of each arc is 5,000 feet for all runways designated as utility or visual; and 10,000 feet for all other runways. The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest determined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000-foot areas, the 5,000-foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal surface, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.

(8) Conical Zone. The conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional zones.

(b) Determination of Zones Where Uncertainty May Arise.

18.205.040 Airport zone height limitations.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit established in this section for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:

(a) Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. Slopes upward 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically, being at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.

(b) Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zone. Slopes upward 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.

(c) Runway Larger Than Utility with a Visibility Minimum Greater Than Three-Fourths-Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes upward 34 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.

(b) Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the executive director of the metropolitan airport authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the metropolitan Topeka airport authority. (Code 1981 § 4-60. Code 1995 § 22-31.)

    State Law References: Nonconforming uses, K.S.A. 3-706.


18.205.070 Permits.

(a) Future Uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone created under this chapter unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted.

(1) However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone.

(2) Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particulars to determine whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations prescribed in this chapter. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.

(b) Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on May 13, 1980, or on the effective date of any amendments to this chapter, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.

(c) Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the chief building inspector or county zoning administrator, within his respective jurisdiction, determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.

(d) Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the city or county board of zoning appeals, dependent upon jurisdiction, for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.

(e) Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and to be reasonable under the circumstances, may be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the metropolitan Topeka airport authority, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. (Code 1981 § 4-61. Code 1995 § 22-32.)

18.215.010 Purpose – Procedure.

(a) The purpose of a conditional use permit, as authorized in the individual district use regulations, is to protect the integrity and character of the district, surrounding properties, and neighborhoods from the potentially adverse effects of certain uses. The uses listed as conditional are normally compatible with the other uses listed in the respective zoning district, but have characteristics that may need to be mitigated and may not be appropriate in all locations.

(b) The design, location and character of a conditional use is subject to the review by the planning commission. The planning commission shall submit its recommendation to the governing body which will decide in accordance with K.S.A. 12-757(d) and amendments thereto.

(c) The granting of a conditional use permit shall be by resolution and shall be assignable to the subject property by legal description and not a person, firm or corporation. (Ord. 19691 § 1, 1-17-12.)


18.215.020 Application.

An application for a conditional use permit shall be submitted and processed in accordance with TMC 18.245.020(b). The applicant shall submit an application form; site plan, map, or diagram showing the existing property, proposed use, and surrounding area; and a statement indicating the physical and operational characteristics of the proposed use, how the use conforms to the guidelines listed in TMC 18.215.030, and any actions taken to lessen adverse impacts upon the surrounding area. The planning director may waive the site plan component if the planning director determines the following:

(a) An applicant has demonstrated the use proposes no physical, site, or building alterations that modify existing building and parking coverage; and

(b) Any conditions imposed can be addressed in the resolution. (Ord. 19691 § 2, 1-17-12.)


18.215.030 Guidelines for evaluation.

The following guidelines shall apply when evaluating a conditional use permit application:

	Guidelines

	(a)	Land use compatibility	 

	 	(1)	Development density	Site area per unit, or intensity of use, should be similar to surrounding uses if not separated by major physical improvements or natural features.

	 	(2)	Height and floor area	Development should minimize difference in height and building size from surrounding structures. Substantial differences shall be justified by urban design considerations.

	 	(3)	Setbacks	Development should respect preexisting setback lines in surrounding area. Variations shall be justified by significant site features or operating characteristics.

18.235.060 Landscape requirements.

(a) Performance Objectives. All required landscape plans shall emphasize plantings along visible street frontages and required buffer yards, including mitigation or screening of parking lots adjacent to public streets. Unless constrained by existing conditions, sites with a single street frontage shall apply 50 percent or more of the total required landscape points to landscape setbacks along street frontages. The minimum percentage of the total required landscape points along street frontages shall increase by 10 percentage points for each additional street frontage. Berms may be used with or in place of shrubs for screening where appropriate.

(b) Planting Requirements/Point System. The developer may use any combination of plantings to obtain the necessary number of points required for the developed area. Different developed areas will lend themselves to different types of plantings. This chapter encourages creativity and diversity in landscaping. In no case shall a monoculture of plantings be allowed. A variation of plantings, at least three different species, is required.

Each landscape plan must equal or exceed a minimum number of base points in order to obtain approval. The number of points required depends on the size of the developed area (see Table 1). In order to obtain points, the plantings must be placed on the developed property and not on the public right-of-way, without the approval of the planning director in consultation with the public works department.

Table 1. Number of Points Required for the Site 

	Square Footage of the Developed Area	Number of Points Required for Sites Classified I-1, I-2, X-2, and X-3	Number of Points Required for Sites Classified C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, U-1, X-1, O&I-1, O&I-2, O&I-3, M-S, and for Multiple-Family Residential Development, Churches, Schools, and Other Institutional Uses in Any Zoning District

	0 – 10,000	33 (+1.5 per parking space)	40 (+1.5 per parking space)

	Greater than 10,000	33 points plus one point for each additional 300 square feet of developed area (+1.5 per parking space)	40 points plus 1.2 points for each additional 300 square feet of developed area (+1.5 per parking space)

Except for industrial uses in I and X-2 districts, all designated outdoor storage, loading, or display areas, including, but not limited to, car lots, lumber yards, warehouses, home improvement centers, and loading docks, will require an additional one point per 600 square feet.

When only a portion of a large lot is developed (e.g., only one acre of a 10-acre lot), only the developed area shall be considered when determining the number of points required.

Table 2. Point Values for Various Plantings  

	Type of Plant Material	Minimum Size	Point Value

	Large tree	2.0 inches – 2.5 inches caliper	11 per tree

	Medium tree	1.25 inches – 1.5 inches caliper	8 per tree

	Understory tree	Single trunk: 1.25 inches – 1.5 inches caliper	5 per tree

	 	Multiple trunk: 6 feet – 8 feet in height	5 per tree

	Coniferous tree	4 feet – 5 feet initial height at planting	8 per tree

	Shrub	2 gallon (established) minimum	1 per shrub

	Ornamental grasses	2 gallon (established) minimum	1 per plant

	Groundcover	Per square foot of landscaped area. Sufficient quantity of plants to cover the entire landscape area within 3 growing seasons.	0.10 per square foot

	Landscape berm	30 inches minimum height with a sufficient quantity of trees, shrubs or plants to equal 1 point per 10 square feet.	0.25 per 3 lineal feet

	Turf berm	30 inches minimum height. 3-foot minimum length, not to exceed 10% of total point requirements.	0.25 per 3 lineal feet

(c) Parking Lot Requirements. All street-level parking lots shall be landscaped in accordance with the following requirements:

(1) In addition to the number of base points required, one and one-half additional points are required for each parking space proposed. These additional points may be achieved by planting parking lot trees and/or parking lot shrubs. For example, a 10,000-square-foot developed area with 10 parking spaces requires 33 base points plus one and one-half points per parking space. The total point requirement for this developed area is 48 (33 base points plus 15 parking lot points).

(2) On parking lots with less than 24 parking spaces, parking lot trees/shrubs may be spaced around the perimeter of the lot as desired to provide a uniform and attractive design.

(3) On lots with more than 24 parking spaces, landscaping shall be provided on parking lot islands and/or parking lot peninsulas within the confines of the developed parking lot at a ratio of one landscaped island or peninsula per 24 parking spaces. These plantings shall be located to minimize and break the expanse of asphalt and concrete. Each parking lot island or peninsula shall be equivalent in size to one parking space. Parking lot islands shall contain shade-producing trees where possible.

(d) Buffers and Buffer Zones. A developed area may be required to buffer certain portions of the development as provided for herein. If a developed area is required to buffer, the more stringent buffer requirements contained herein shall apply. Accumulation of minimum required landscaping points shall not reduce the requirements for any landscaped buffer as specified herein.

(1) Residential Zone Buffer. On any commercial, industrial, institutional, PUD, conditional use permit, or multifamily development (three or more units), adjacent to a residential zoning district, a landscaped buffer along the property line(s) of the developing property is required. The buffer shall run the entire length of the abutting lot line(s). The type of buffer may consist of any combination of the following:

(i) A solid opaque fence not less that six feet in height, and a six-foot-wide buffer of landscaped plantings located on the outside of the fence, not to exceed six-foot spacing between plants.

(ii) A landscaped buffer no less than six feet in width, planted with a series of evergreen plantings which will grow to at least six feet in height and spaced in a manner to provide an impervious visual barrier, not to exceed six-foot spacing between plants.

(iii) A landscaped berm at least 30 inches in height continuing the entire length of the abutting property line. A landscape credit for a landscaped berm may be claimed (per Table 1) in order to meet the screening requirements for the developing property. Such berm must be planted with trees, shrubs and/or plants in order to satisfy buffer requirements. A berm planted exclusively in turf grass is not considered by itself sufficient to satisfy buffer requirements as required by this chapter.

(iv) Natural, undisturbed forest at least 20 feet in width that provides a nearly impervious visual barrier due to the dense nature of the plants and/or trees. If this option is chosen, the planning director shall determine whether the barrier is satisfactory through a site inspection prior to plan approval. Protective measures shall be provided during construction to ensure the area is protected from damage due to construction.

(2) Parking Lot Buffer. All parking areas and associated driveways shall be buffered with landscaping and set back as follows:

(i) An area not less than four feet in width shall be located between a parking lot and an adjacent property line of a nonresidential zoning district. For sites classified I-1, I-2, X-2, or X-3, such buffering shall not be required where an equivalent buffer exists on the adjoining property.

(ii) A landscaped setback not less than 20 feet shall be located between all parking lots and any public street right-of-way for lots platted on or after June 11, 2002, except when surface parking is placed to the side or rear of the building in which case the width of the parking area, as measured by a line parallel with the street right-of-way, is no more than one-half of the frontage on the street right-of-way and the development meets the front yard building setbacks in TMC 18.230.030. A landscape setback of not less than five feet shall be required from public street right-of-way for all other lots.

(e) Landscape for Industrial Uses. For industrial uses in I and X-2 districts, unimproved areas and outdoor storage areas will not be applied toward the generation of required points provided the purpose and performance objectives of this chapter, including the creation of landscape buffers and proper screening of parking and storage areas, are met. (Ord. 20150 § 4, 10-23-18.)

18.235.070 Existing trees.

(a) Credits for Existing Trees. In order to encourage the preservation of existing trees, credits up to 50 percent of required base points may be given in the event existing trees are preserved.

For each existing significant tree with a diameter caliper between six inches and 12 inches that is preserved on the landscape plan, a credit of 15 base points will be applied. For each existing significant tree with a D.B.H. between 12 inches and 24 inches, a credit of 20 base points will be applied. For each existing significant tree with a D.B.H. over 24 inches, a credit of 25 base points will be applied. Any significant tree that dies during construction, or because of construction, must be replaced with a tree or trees of a similar species, or a species approved by the city forester, to equal or exceed the point value of the lost tree.

(b) Additional Points Required for Removal of Existing Significant Trees. Any existing significant trees removed from the site shall require additional base points above those calculated for the square footage of the developed area. For trees removed between six inches and 12 inches diameter caliper, an additional 15 base points shall be required. For trees removed between 12 inches and 24 inches D.B.H., an additional 20 base points shall be required. For any trees removed that are larger than 25 inches D.B.H., an additional 25 base points shall be required. If the planning director, in consultation with the city forester, determines that removal of any aforementioned significant trees will not be detrimental to the overall appearance of the development, some or all of these additional point requirements may be waived.

(c) Trees for which a developer wishes to receive credit must be within the developed area, and incorporated into an overall landscape design. (Ord. 18255 § 5, 6-1-04; Ord. 17846 § 7, 6-11-02. Code 1995 § 48-38.06.)

    Cross References: Planning department, TMC 2.25.090; city forester, Chapter 12.65 TMC.


18.235.080 Irrigation system credits.

In order to sustain the benefits of landscaped areas as required by this chapter, credits may be authorized if the developer provides an industry standard irrigation system. Credits may be authorized as follows:

(a) A maximum of 20 percent of the total irrigated area may be deducted from the calculation of base points if the developer installs an industry standard, permanent, underground irrigation system. Such deduction may be authorized only from the square footage of the area covered by the irrigation system.

(b) If an underground irrigation system is claimed for credit against the base point formula, installation and operation plans of the irrigation system must be submitted to the planning director for approval.

(c) Credits authorized for irrigation systems shall not reduce the requirements for residential zone buffers or parking lot buffers as established by this chapter. (Ord. 18255 § 6, 6-1-04; Ord. 17846 § 8, 6-11-02. Code 1995 § 48-38.07.)

    Cross References: Planning department, TMC 2.25.090.


18.235.090 Stormwater best management practice credits.

Credits may be authorized up to 20 percent when stormwater best management practices are incorporated into the landscape plan, subject to the approval of the water pollution control division, city of Topeka. Such practices shall adhere to recognized principles of stormwater drainage engineering and consist of but are not limited to:

(a) Bioretention systems.

(b) Open vegetated channels.

(c) Filter strip.

(d) Dry and wet swales.

(e) Detention systems.

(f) Retention/wetland systems.

(g) Stream buffers.

A point value of credit for stormwater best management practices shall be established by separate resolution of the city of Topeka. (Ord. 18255 § 7, 6-1-04; Ord. 17846 § 9, 6-11-02. Code 1995 § 48-38.08.)


18.235.100 Enforcement.

Enforcement of these regulations shall be subject to the authority granted to the city of Topeka zoning administrator as established in TMC 18.50.120.

The owner is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of planted materials trees in perpetuity within his/her development. Failure by the developer and/or owner to comply with the applicable provisions of the article on landscape requirements shall cause the developer and/or owner to be ineligible for any additional building permits. No additional building permits shall issue until the developer and/or owner has complied with this chapter or made arrangements satisfactory to the planning director for compliance.

After all plantings are completed, the developer will schedule an inspection of the plantings with the planning department and landscaping installer. If all plantings are in good condition and properly meet the requirements of the landscape plan as required by this chapter, the planning department will issue a landscape certificate of completion to the developer and building official. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued if the landscape certificate of completion has not been issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if building construction is completed outside of the growing season, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued with the condition attached that the landscape certificate of completion must be issued prior to the end of the next growing season. Failure to obtain the landscape certificate of completion by the end of that growing season shall be sufficient grounds for revocation of the conditional certificate of occupancy.

If plantings are subsequently determined by the planning director to be damaged, in poor condition, diseased, or dead, the planning director may issue notice to the real property owner of record requiring maintenance and/or the replacement of plantings in order to bring the developed area into compliance with the approved landscape plan. If the required maintenance or replacement is not accomplished within one growing season which is considered to begin March 1st and end November 15th, the planning director on behalf of the city shall cause the required maintenance or replacement of plantings to be accomplished and cost thereof shall be assessed against the real property as a service assessment. (Ord. 18255 § 8, 6-1-04; Ord. 17846 § 10, 6-11-02. Code 1995 § 48-38.09.)

18.240.020 Off-street parking requirements.

(a) General Requirements. The following requirements shall govern in the design, location and number of off-street parking and stacking spaces:

(1) Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking and stacking spaces results in a requirement of a fractional space, the fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, and a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one space.

(2) Utilization. Off-street parking and stacking facilities provided for the uses hereinafter listed shall be reserved exclusively for the parking of bicycles and motor vehicles, in operating condition, of patrons, occupants, visitors or employees of such uses.

(3) Computing Off-Street Parking. In computing the floor area to determine the requirement for off-street parking, such computations for a structure shall exclude:



(i) The exterior wall width of the structure;

(ii) Elevator shafts;

(iii) Common courts or lobby areas;

(ix) Incidental storage areas including but not limited to janitorial rooms, supply rooms, etc.

The building official shall determine the net floor area of the structure and shall require off-street parking as specified for the use set forth in the applicable district regulations.

(4) Shared Parking Provisions. In the case of mixed uses, the off-street parking and stacking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately, provided all regulations governing the location of accessory off-street parking and stacking spaces in relation to the uses served are adhered to.

(b) Specific Requirements.

(1) Open and Enclosed Parking. Accessory off-street parking and stacking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed within a garage.

(2) Surfacing. All off-street parking and stacking spaces, aisles and drives shall be surfaced in accordance with the standards and specifications of the city or county.

(3) Location. Off-street parking and stacking spaces, aisles and drives shall be located as follows:

(i) General.

(A) Bicycle parking, off-street parking and stacking spaces, aisles and drives shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use served.

(B) Protective curbs shall be required to be installed three feet from public sidewalks to protect pedestrians a minimum of two feet from adjacent property lines, and at other places on the parking lot as may be required by the code enforcement director or the city engineer to protect the adjacent property.

(C) Aisles and drives shall not be considered in determining whether off-street parking and stacking requirements have been met except in the instance of single-family dwellings and duplexes.

(ii) Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking shall be located in designated areas which minimize pedestrian and vehicle conflict. Bicycle parking shall be located within 120 feet of a main building entrance in an area that is visible and well-lighted. Well-lighted means a brightness level of at least one footcandle. Where multiple buildings exist, bicycle parking shall be distributed in a manner that serves all of the buildings in areas that are visible and well-lighted.

(4) Design. Except for single-family dwellings and duplexes, all bicycle parking, off-street parking, and stacking spaces, aisles and drives shall comply with the following prescribed standards:

(i) Area. Vehicular parking and stacking spaces shall comply with the minimum dimensions illustrated in Figure 1.

(ii) Access.

(A) Vehicular. Each vehicular parking space shall open directly upon an aisle of such width and design as illustrated in Figure 1. The greatest aisle width shown in Figure 1 shall be provided when combining different parking space configurations on the same aisle. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movement; and all such points of access must be approved by the public works department. Aisles designed for two-way traffic shall have a minimum width of 24 feet.

(B) Bicycle. Each bicycle parking space shall comply with the minimum dimensions as illustrated in Figure 2.

(iii) Exiting a Parking Facility. No off-street parking facility shall be designed in such a manner that when exiting a parking facility it would require backing into a public street.

(iv) Curbing. Protective curbing shall be installed a minimum of three feet from a public sidewalk and two feet from adjacent property lines.

(v) Markings. The parking spaces in all off-street parking areas shall be visibly delineated on the surface by painted or marked stripes.

(vi) Bicycle Rack Design. Examples of approved bicycle racks are illustrated in Figure 3. Bicycle parking racks shall meet all of the following requirements:

(A) Located on paved, impervious, or approved pervious surfaces and securely anchored to the ground;

(B) Support the bicycle in at least two places;

(C) Enable the frame and at least one wheel to be secured; and

(D) Installed according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

(vii) Public Right-of-Way. Bicycle racks may be installed on public rights-of-way where there are no setbacks and the public works director has determined that interference with pedestrian traffic is minimal.

(5) Screening. All open, off-street parking facilities containing eight or more parking spaces shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining residential property (including single-family, duplex and multiple-family) or institutional property with a continuous, view-reducing wood fence, masonry wall, compact evergreen hedge or other landscape screening material which, when planted, will constitute an immediate view-reducing barrier. Such view-reducing screen shall be at least four feet but not more than eight feet in height. The requirement for screening may be waived with written approval from the adjacent property owner.

(6) Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking facilities shall be directed away from residential properties and public streets in such a way as not to create a nuisance. However, in no case shall such lighting exceed three footcandles measured at the lot line.

(7) Drainage. All stormwater runoff shall be collected, transported and disposed of in a manner as approved by the city engineer.

(8) Accessible Parking. Where a use is required to provide accessibility for persons with disabilities, the required parking spaces shall be located and designed in accordance with standards as set by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

(9) Bicycle Parking. New off-street parking constructed after June 1, 2014, shall include additional parking for bicycles. The additional parking area shall be equivalent to five percent of the number of vehicular parking spaces required in TMC 18.240.030, with a minimum of two. Parking facilities that are expanded after June 1, 2014, shall include additional parking for bicycles in the expanded area that is equal to five percent of the number of vehicular parking spaces required in TMC 18.240.030 in the expanded area, with a minimum of two.

(10) Modification of Parking Requirements.

(i) Reduction of Parking Spaces. Where it can be demonstrated by the property owner that a specific use has such characteristics that the number of parking or stacking spaces required is too restrictive, the planning director may, upon request, grant up to a 25 percent reduction in the number of required spaces. Such request shall be filed with the planning director on forms as may be provided. Should a reduction greater than 25 percent be requested, the applicant may request a variance from the board of zoning appeals in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 2.120 TMC. Where a reduction of 25 percent or less is requested, the applicant shall be required to reserve an area of land on the site of the use served equal in size to the area of land needed to provide the spaces for which a reduction is granted. Such land reserved shall be suitable for development of a parking facility and conform with the parking requirements.

(ii) Bicycle Parking Substitution. In addition to the bicycle parking required in subsection (b)(9) of this section, up to 10 percent of the number of vehicular parking spaces required in TMC 18.240.030 may be substituted with bicycle parking.

(11) Condition of Off-Street Parking Facility. Any parking facility which does not meet the standards of this division and which shall create a nuisance to the public from any cause shall meet the requirements as recommended by the city or county traffic engineer, city or county engineer, planning director and city or county building official, pertaining to screening, surfacing or entrances or exits.

18.240.040 Approval of off-street parking facilities.

The design of all off-street parking facilities shall be subject to the approval of the building official prior to issuance of a building and/or parking lot permit, or for any certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required. Before approving any off-street parking plan, the official shall find the spaces, aisles and drives provided are usable as designed and meet the requirements as set forth herein.

(a) Submission of Site Plan. Any application for a parking lot and/or building permit, or for any certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required, shall include therewith a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned. Said plan shall show the full extent of the area to be used for off-street parking including angle and dimension of vehicular parking and stacking spaces, aisles and drives; type of surfacing; radius of curb return; width of curb opening; identify protective curbing; direction of traffic flow; drainage pattern and method of collection; sidewalks, bicycle parking, and type and height of screening and parking area trees. Bicycle racks may be installed on public rights-of-way where there are no setbacks and the public works director has determined that interference with pedestrian traffic is minimal.

(b) Temporary Permit. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, all parking and stacking spaces, aisles and drives shall be properly constructed and surfaced; except that the building official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy in those instances where the building official finds that the surfacing cannot reasonably be completed due to adverse weather conditions or settling of land on the site after demolition or filling. A temporary certificate of occupancy shall be effective only to a date specified.

(c) Enforcement. If the applicant fails to construct the parking facility in conformity with the requirements of this chapter or other prescribed requirements, the governing body may order the removal or replacement of the nonconforming parking facility or portion thereof. The cost of removal or replacement and any necessary reconstruction shall be levied as a special assessment against the property.

(d) Public right-of-way shall not be utilized for internal traffic circulation or stacking for drive-up window facilities and similar such car-service features.

(e) All facilities proposing “drive-in” and/or “carry-out” service features shall be reviewed and considered by the traffic engineer or designee in respect to: ingress/egress to public right-of-way; the impact upon streetside parking; adequacy of on-site vehicle storage, parking and traffic patterns; and pedestrian safety. The traffic engineer or designee shall not approve the proposal if the public safety and welfare are negatively impacted. (Ord. 19904 § 3, 5-13-14.)

18.245.020 Procedure.

Amendments to this division may be made to either the specific provisions or text of this division, or to the district map. Any amendment shall be adopted by the governing body by ordinance (applicable to the jurisdiction of the city of Topeka, Kansas) and resolution (applicable to the jurisdiction of unincorporated Shawnee County, Kansas); and said documents shall be published in the official newspaper as required by law.

Such notice shall fix the time and place for such hearing.

(3) The hearing may be adjourned from time to time and at the conclusion of the same, a majority of the members of the entire planning commission shall be required to recommend approval or denial of the amendment to the governing body. An individual motion to approve or to deny which receives less than a majority vote of the members of the planning commission shall be deemed a failed motion and no further action by the planning commission is required. In such instances, the matter shall not be transmitted to the governing body for consideration.

(4) Upon receipt of the recommendation and written summary of the hearing, the governing body either may:

(i) Approve such recommendations by the adoption of the same by ordinance in a city or resolution in a county;

(ii) Override the planning commission’s recommendations by a two-thirds majority vote of the membership of the governing body;

(iii) May return the same to the planning commission for further consideration, together with a statement specifying the basis for the governing body’s failure to approve or disapprove.

(5) If the governing body returns the planning commission’s recommendations, the planning commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendations giving the reasons therefor or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the governing body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by the respective ordinance or resolution, or the governing body need take no further action thereon.

(6) If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the governing body following the planning commission’s next regular meeting after receipt of the governing body’s report, the governing body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly.

(b) The procedure for amending the district map shall be in accordance with state statutes and specifically provide for the order set forth below:

(1) All proposed amendments to the district map shall be referred to the planning commission as initiated by the governing body or the commission; or upon a property owner by filing the request with the planning agency.

(2) The planning director shall have the authority and responsibility to establish the processing schedule and administrative procedures to consider the request, as well as determine required basic information and data relative to the proposal in respect to processing of any proposed amendment or conditional use permits.

(3) Any proposed district map amendment initiated by a property owner of the property affected shall be processed as follows:

(i) Prior to filing an application, the applicant is encouraged to request a preapplication conference with the planning agency staff. The purpose of the conference is to provide the owner an opportunity to explain the general development concept and site conditions, and for the planning staff to explain this division, and regulations, standards, policies, alternatives and constraints applicable to the proposal and site, as well as the comprehensive plan or other adopted plans, programs, or development policies.

(ii) At the time of the preapplication conference, the owner shall provide the following general information:

(A) A legal description and area of subject property.

(iii) The owner shall file an official application for an amendment, which shall consist of:

(A) Filing fee.

(B) Official application and justification.

(C) Supporting information, including the following:

10. The planning director may require the subject property to be platted or replatted simultaneously with consideration of a zoning amendment on the subject property.

(D) Petitioners of the planned unit development district shall submit for review processing and adoption, the plan of development in accordance with provisions set forth in the PUD district.

(E) Proof that all real property taxes including any special assessments are paid to date and are current for the subject property. In the event real property taxes, including any special assessments, are delinquent, the application for amendment shall not be scheduled for public hearing until such time as the taxes, including any special assessments, are paid or satisfactory escrow arrangements for the payment of such taxes or special assessments have been made and presented to the city attorney’s office and/or Shawnee County counselor’s office for approval.

(iv) The proposed amendment shall be published in the official newspaper at least 20 days prior to the public hearing.

(v) In addition to such publication notice, written notice of such proposed amendment shall be mailed at least 20 days before the hearing to all owners of record of lands located within at least 200 feet of the area proposed to be altered for regulations of the city and to all owners of record of lands located within at least 1,000 feet of the area proposed to be altered for regulations of the county. The notice shall fix the time and place of the public hearing to consider a proposed rezoning, and of an opportunity granted to interested parties to be heard.

(vii) Notice requirements as set forth in this chapter are sufficient to permit the planning commission to recommend amendments to zoning regulations which affect only a portion of the land described in the notice or which give all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice. A recommendation of a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice shall not be valid without republication and, where necessary, remailing, unless the planning commission has previously established a table or publication available to the public which designates what zoning classifications are lesser changes authorized within the published zoning classifications.

(viii) The planning staff shall examine the application with respect to the comprehensive plan, policies and other development requirements, existing infrastructure and capacities with respect to essential public improvements, and shall make a report to the planning commission.

(D) The extent to which removal of the restrictions will detrimentally affect nearby properties.

(E) The length of time the subject property has remained vacant (or unused) as zoned.

(F) The relative gain to the public health, safety and welfare by the destruction of the value of affected property as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual landowner.

(G) Recommendation of professional staff.

(H) Conformance to adopted or recognized comprehensive plan.

(x) The planning commission members shall publicly disclose any ex parte contacts prior to receiving testimony at the time of the public hearing.

A majority of the members of the planning commission present and voting at the hearing shall be required to recommend approval or denial of the amendment to the governing body. If the planning commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request, the planning commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval. The adoption of an amendment to the district map shall conform to all provisions pertaining to legal protest as set forth elsewhere in this division.

Chapter 18.250 COMMUNICATION TOWERS

Sections:

18.250.010    Statement of purpose.

18.250.020    Regulations.


18.250.010 Statement of purpose.

The purpose of these regulations is to establish reasonable restrictions for the siting and screening of communication towers and their related equipment in order to accommodate the growth of wireless communication systems while protecting the public against any adverse impacts on the community’s aesthetic resources and the public welfare. To balance the growth of wireless communication systems while protecting the public health, safety and welfare, these regulations establish minimum standards for construction and facility siting to minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design, siting, lighting and screening, avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and appropriate siting of tower structures, encourage the joint use of any new communication tower to reduce the number of such towers needed in the future, and require the removal of abandoned towers. (Ord. 17138 § 1, 7-1-97. Code 1995 § 48-26.16.)


18.250.020 Regulations.

(a) Each application for a conditional use permit for a communication antenna or communication tower or where the same is permitted as a provisional use and where the location of the proposed communication antenna or communication tower is within the incorporated boundaries of the city, shall be accompanied by a development plan which shall include the following information:

(1) Site Development Plan. A site plan or plans drawn to scale of one inch equals 30 feet or larger and identifying the site boundary; tower(s); guy wire anchors; existing and proposed structures; vehicular parking and access; existing vegetation and proposed landscaping; and uses, structures, and land use designations on the site and abutting parcels.

(2) A report from a registered professional engineer which describes the tower’s design standards and structural capacity, including the number and type of antennas it can accommodate.

(3) A study comparing all potential host sites within an approximate one-half-mile radius of the subject site. Potential sites shall include existing structures and towers in excess of 100 feet and properties where towers are permitted under existing regulations or by conditional use permit. The study shall include a description of the surrounding sites, a discussion of the ability or inability of the site/tower to host a communications facility and the reasons why the site/tower was excluded from consideration. The planning director, the planning commission or the city council may require the review of additional sites pending review of the initial study. The applicant shall demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction that the alternative site or tower is not available due to one or more of the following reasons:

(i) Unwillingness of the owner to entertain a communications facility proposal.

(ii) Topographic limitations of the site.

(iii) Adjacent impediments that would obstruct adequate communication tower transmission.

(iv) Physical site constraints that would preclude the construction of a communication tower.

(v) Technical limitation of the system.

(vi) The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of existing and approved towers and facilities, considering existing and planned use for those facilities.

(vii) The planned equipment would cause frequency interference with other existing or planned equipment, which cannot be reasonably prevented.

(viii) Existing or approved towers or facilities do not have space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and reasonably.

(ix) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render the use of existing towers and structures unsuitable.

(4) A photo simulation of the proposed facility from the perspective of affected residential properties and public rights-of-way as may be required by the planning director.

(5) An explanation of the need for the facility to maintain the integrity of the communication system. A map showing the service area of the proposed tower shall be made available to the staff, the planning commission and/or the city council upon request.

(6) A signed statement from the applicant indicating their intention to share space on the tower with other providers subject to reasonable, acceptable terms and the total anticipated number of providers the communication tower can support.

(7) A copy of the lease between the applicant and the landowner. The lease shall contain the following provisions:

(i) The landowner and the applicant shall have the ability to enter into leases with other carriers for co-location.

(ii) The landowner shall be responsible for the removal of the communication tower or facility in the event the lessee fails to remove it upon abandonment as required by these regulations.

(b) An initial request for a conditional use permit shall be limited to five years. At the time of renewal the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning director that a good-faith effort has been made to cooperate with other providers to establish co-location at the tower site. “Good-faith effort” shall include, but is not limited to, timely response to co-location inquiries from other providers and sharing of technical information to evaluate the feasibility of establishing co-location. Failure to demonstrate that a good-faith effort has been made may result in the denial of the request for a renewal. Renewal of a conditional use permit is not required as set forth herein upon a finding by the planning director that (1) the communication tower has the capacity to support collocation of additional providers and/or collocation of additional providers has occurred during the preceding five years, and (2) that the tower and site continues to be in conformity with the development plan approved for the original conditional use permit.

(c) Height. The maximum height which may be approved for a communications tower is 320 feet. A lightning rod shall not be included within the height limitations. All new towers in excess of 250 feet shall be designed to accommodate at least three additional providers. The location of additional antenna on a legally existing tower shall not require additional approval from the planning commission or city council. The height limitation for towers may be waived as recommended by the planning commission and approved by the city council.

(d) Tower Design. All communication towers shall be designed and engineering sealed by a registered professional engineer and conform to the design standards of the Electronic Industry Association’s EIA/TIA-222-E, as amended. All communication towers of 150 feet or less shall be of a monopole design unless otherwise recommended by the planning commission and approved by the city council. Communication towers under 150 feet may be lattice or guyed tower construction, provided the tower is designed to accommodate one or more providers. Communication towers in excess of 150 feet may be a self-supporting lattice tower or guyed tower.

(e) Setbacks. Towers and accessory buildings shall meet the yard requirements of the zoning district in which they are located unless adjacent to residentially zoned property wherein the setback shall be not less than one-half the height of the tower. In the event the adjacent residentially zoned property is unplatted and not developed or used as residential property then the setback may be reduced at the request of the applicant for cause shown with the written authorization of the planning director. The setback requirement may be waived by the planning commission, subject to approval by the city council, if documentation from a registered professional engineer is submitted certifying that in the event of a tower failure or collapse, the fall zone of the tower will be contained within the proposed setback area. All guy wire anchors shall be no closer than 20 feet from any lot line wherein the adjacent property is zoned for residential use.

(f) Separation Requirements. All communication towers, except those designed as an architecturally compatible element in terms of the material, design and height to the existing or proposed use of the property, shall comply with the following separation requirements:

	 	Towers in excess of 100 feet	Towers less than 100 feet

	Towers in excess of 100 feet	1,500'	1,000'

	Towers less than 100 feet	1,000'	1,000'

(g) Separation Deviations. The planning commission may recommend to the city council which shall have the authority to grant a deviation from the separation standards. In support of a deviation request from the separation requirements, the applicant shall submit a technical study acceptable to the city which confirms that there are not other suitable sites available within the separation requirements. The planning commission may also recommend to the city council that a deviation be granted to allow two or more communication towers within a 200-foot radius be clustered for the purpose of lessening the overall visual impacts of such towers on the community.

(h) Towers on Structures. The location of towers and antennas on existing buildings and other structures is encouraged as an alternative to placement on the ground and may be upon buildings and other structures within any zoning district where such is a lawful use, subject to the following:

(1) The height of the tower or antenna does not extend more than 20 feet above the height of the structure.

(2) The setback of the tower from a building roof edge shall be at least 10 feet.

The location of communication towers or communication antenna on existing structures pursuant to this subsection shall not require a conditional use permit or other approval from the planning commission or city council; provided, structural information is provided to the planning department which indicates the structure is physically capable of supporting the communication tower or communication antenna.

(i) Parking Areas and Drives. All parking areas and drives associated with the communication tower shall comply with applicable city design criteria except that the planning commission may recommend that the city council waive the requirements for curbing and drainage facilities when they are not needed for drainage purposes.

(j) Equipment Storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the communication tower unless repairs to the tower are being made.

(k) Accessory Uses. Accessory uses shall include only such buildings and facilities necessary for transmission functions and satellite ground stations associated with them, but shall not include broadcast studios, offices, vehicle storage area, nor other similar uses not necessary for the transmission function. All accessory building shall be constructed of building materials consistent with the primary use of the site and shall be subject to site plan approval. Where there is not primary use other than the tower, the building materials for the accessory building shall be subject to the review and approval of the planning commission and/or city council.

(l) Lighting. Communication towers shall not be lighted except to ensure public safety as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Security lighting around the base of a tower may be provided if the lighting is shielded so that no light is directed towards adjacent properties or rights-of-way. Any lighting required by the FAA shall consist of a white flashing light during the daytime and a red flashing light during the nighttime.

(m) Screening. The base of the tower shall be screened from view with a solid screening fence a minimum of six feet in height. The materials of the fence, including security wire, shall be specified in the development plan and subject to the review and approval of the planning commission and the city council. The planning commission and the city council may waive the required screening where the design of the accessory building is architecturally compatible to the primary use of the property.

(n) Aesthetics and Advertising. All towers and accessory facilities shall be sited, designed, screened and landscaped to have the least practical adverse visual effect on the environment. Appropriate landscaping shall be provided to buffer the facility from adjacent residential areas and public streets. Existing plant material shall be preserved to the extent possible. No portion of the communication tower, antenna, or perimeter fence, shall be used for commercial advertising, provided, a sign not exceeding four square feet shall be posted on the tower, or the exterior fence around the base of the tower, noting the name and telephone number of the tower owner and operator.

(o) Removal of Abandoned Antennas and Towers. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a period of 12 continuous months or which was operated under a conditional use permit which has expired and not renewed shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the same within 90 days of a receipt of notice from the planning director notifying the owner of such required abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the city council may cause the removal of such antenna or tower at the owner’s expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users have ceased using the tower for a period of 12 continuous months.

(p) Application of Regulations to Existing Communication Towers, Communication Antenna or Accessory Facilities. For purposes of determining fair market value pursuant with the provisions of TMC 18.220.030, it shall be based upon the combined value of the communication tower(s), communication antenna(s) and on-site principal building(s) to which accessory.

(q) Platting Requirements. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the platting or replatting of separate lots for the location of towers that may be unrelated to another principal use located on such lot. (Ord. 17138 § 3, 7-1-97. Code 1995 § 48-26.17.)

In considering and acting upon site plans, the planning director shall take into consideration the public health, safety, and welfare, the comfort and convenience of the public in general and the immediate neighborhood in particular. The following guidelines shall be considered in the evaluation of site plans:

(a) General Plan Conformity. The planning director shall review all site plans in accordance with the adopted comprehensive metropolitan plan and/or neighborhood plans for conformity with the adopted plans’ objectives, policies, and/or design guidelines.

(b) Circulation – Driveways, Sidewalks, Off-Street Parking, Loading, Curbs and Gutters. The planning director shall review all site plans for access and circulation features to provide mobility for people and goods to reach the site and circulate through it in a safe and efficient manner. All modes of transportation (pedestrian and automobile) must be considered in the site plan review.

(c) Landscaping and Buffers. All site plans shall provide for the landscaping and buffering of all building sites and parking areas. Review of landscaping and buffering is intended to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by preventing soil erosion; providing shade; protecting from excessive noise, glare, and heat; conserving natural resources of air and water; enhancing the overall appearance of development sites; and facilitating a convenient, attractive, and harmonious streetscape and community. All site plans shall comply with adopted landscape ordinances.

(d) Lighting. All site plans shall provide adequate lighting so as to assure safety and security. Lighting installations shall not have an adverse impact on traffic safety or on the surrounding area. Light sources shall be shielded, and there shall be no spillover onto adjacent properties.

(e) Public Health and Safety. Applicable emergency service agencies shall review all site plans to determine adequacy of access and other aspects of public safety, including crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) concepts such as natural surveillance, natural access control, and territorial reinforcement.

(f) Signs. The site plan shall conform to adopted sign ordinances and address the following considerations:

(1) Traffic Signals. No sign shall be maintained at any location which obstructs, impairs, obscures, interferes with the view of, or is confused with, any traffic control sign or device regardless of whether or not it meets other size, location, and setback requirements of adopted sign codes. Nor shall any sign interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic flow. A sign’s position, size, shape, content, color and illumination shall be considered when making such a determination.

(2) Sight Distance Triangles. No sign or any part of a sign other than a supporting pole or brace no greater than 18 inches in width or diameter shall be located lower than nine feet from grade within the area of any sight distance triangle.

(3) Landscaping. Signs proposed to be located within a landscaped area shall be located so as not to be obstructed from full-growth of landscaping. All sign base landscaping shall be of the nature and quality so as not to obstruct a motorist’s view of other vehicles moving within a parking lot or entering and exiting a driveway.

(4) Site Comprehension. Signs shall be designed and located to strengthen overall site comprehension through the use of comprehensive sign packages, where applicable, and the location of signs to clearly define points of access.

(g) Utilities. Ground mounted transformers and air conditioning units shall be screened if visible from the street or when adjacent to a structure on adjoining lot(s). All such units shall be located behind the front yard and side street yard setback lines.

(h) Floodway. Any development within floodways as identified on flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) shall comply with applicable city and county standards. General development guidelines include: anchorage to prevent flotation, construction with materials resistant to flood damage, floodproofing all utility and sanitary facilities, and designed so as to not increase surface elevation of the 100-year flood.

(i) Aviation. Any development located within prescribed aviation zones shall comply with applicable city ordinances and county standards. General development guidelines include the evaluation of height, dust, and lighting.

(j) Stormwater Drainage and Stream Buffers. Measures taken for erosion, pollutant, and sedimentation control shall conform to applicable city standards for stormwater management and stream buffers as required in TMC Titles 13 and 17. A stormwater management plan, if required by Chapter 13.35 TMC, shall be submitted, reviewed, and approved concurrently with the site plan.

(k) Trash and Recycling Containers. Trash containers, trash compactors, and recycling containers shall be screened from public view on a minimum of three sides. Screening may include landscaping, walls or fences of design and construction compatible with the principal building, or a combination of walls, fences, and landscaping. If possible, given the constraints of the site and buildings, areas for trash and recycling containers shall be oriented toward the interior of the site and not be located in building setbacks. Trash and recycling walls and fences exceeding seven feet in height shall not be located in required front yard building setbacks and in side yard setbacks adjacent to a street.

The purpose of these regulations is to allow the effective and efficient use of wind energy systems in nonresidential areas to reduce the on-site consumption of utility supplied electricity, and to establish reasonable restrictions for the general placement of wind energy systems, otherwise known as wind turbines, and their related equipment in order to accommodate the growth of personal and commercial electric power generating systems, while protecting against adverse noise, aesthetic and safety impacts and protecting the general public welfare. To balance the technological advances in off-grid energy production while protecting the public health, safety and welfare, these regulations establish minimum standards for construction and placement of facilities to minimize adverse impacts through careful design and placement of wind energy systems to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties. (Ord. 19598 § 1, 6-28-11.)

Adopted Neighborhood Conservation District design standards:

Westboro Neighborhood Conservation District

Elmhurst Neighborhood Conservation District


18.270.010 Purpose.

The governing body recognizes that there are several unique and distinctive older residential neighborhoods which contribute significantly to the overall character and identity of the city, and are worthy of preservation, appropriate maintenance, and protection. As a matter of public policy, the city, in partnership with its distinctive neighborhood organizations, aims to preserve, protect, enhance, and sustain the value of these residential neighborhoods through the establishment of neighborhood conservation districts (NCD). The purpose of an NCD is to promote compatible new construction, alterations, and demolitions within the district’s built environment in order to strengthen and build upon those desirable physical features already existing. (Ord. 19815 § 1, 5-7-13.)


18.270.020 Designation.

The governing body may designate certain residential neighborhoods, or portions thereof, as neighborhood conservation districts. Neighborhood conservation districts shall be overlays to existing zoning districts. Property within an NCD must also be designated as being within one of the existing zoning district classifications. Such property shall comply with all applicable use restrictions unless further restricted by the NCD. Separate ordinances shall designate each NCD which shall be distinguished as separate zoning districts. Ordinances designating each NCD shall identify the designated district boundaries, and specify the individual purposes and design standards for that district. Where any conflict exists between zoning districts, the provisions of the NCD shall control. (Ord. 19815 § 2, 5-7-13.)

All contracts for the sale of property of the value of more than $2,500.00 or for any concession in or lease of property of the authority for a term of more than one year shall be awarded to the highest responsive and responsible bidder after advertising for bids.

Formal advertising and bidding procedures will not be required in the following situations:

(1) The item is available only from a single source; or

(2) Public exigency or emergency when the urgency for the requirement will not permit a delay incident to competitive solicitation; or

(3) Urban mass transportation administration authorizes noncompetitive negotiation; or

(4) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

All contracts involving less than $10,000.00 shall be let by competitive bidding whenever possible and in any event in a manner calculated to ensure the best interest of the public.

In determining the responsibility of any bidder, the board may take into account past records of dealings with the bidder, experience, adequacy of equipment, ability to complete performance within the time set, and other factors besides financial responsibility, but in no case shall any such contract be awarded to any other than the highest bidder (in case of sale, concession or lease) or the lowest bidder (in case of purchase or expenditure) unless authorized or approved by a vote of at least four members of the board, and unless such action is accompanied by a statement in writing setting forth the reasons for not awarding the contract to the highest or lowest bidder, as the case may be, which statement shall be kept on file in the principal office of the authority and open to public inspection.

Contracts shall not be split into parts involving expenditure of less than $10,000.00 for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this section, and all such split contracts shall be void. If any collusion occurs among bidders or prospective bidders in restraint of freedom of competition, by agreement to bid a fixed amount or to refrain from bidding, or otherwise, the bids of such bidders shall be void. Each bidder shall accompany his or her bid with a sworn statement that he or she has not been a party to any such agreement.

The board shall have the right to reject all bids and to readvertise for bids. If after such readvertisement no responsible and satisfactory bid, within the terms of the advertisement, shall be received, the board may award such contract without competitive bidding, providing that it shall not be less advantageous to the authority than any valid bid received pursuant to advertisement.

That in consideration of the benefits to be derived by the City and its inhabitants, there is hereby granted to The Kansas Power and Light Company, a Kansas corporation, hereinafter sometimes designated as “Company,” said Company being a corporation operating a system for the transmission of electric current between two (2) or more incorporated cities in the State of Kansas, and also operating a system for the transmission and distribution of natural gas in the State of Kansas, the right, privilege, and authority for a period of twenty (20) years from and after January 1, 1987, the effective date of this ordinance, to occupy and use the several streets, avenues, alleys, bridges, parks, parkings, and public places of said City, for the placing and maintaining of equipment and property necessary to carry on the business of selling and distributing electricity and natural gas for all purposes to the City and its inhabitants, and through said City and beyond the limits thereof; to obtain said electricity and natural gas from any source available; and to do all things necessary or proper to carry on said business in the City.

The rates charged any customer in the City for electric current or natural gas and rates charged to the City for the maintenance and operation of its street lighting system including underground installations by the Company, its successors or assigns, shall be in accordance with schedules of rates now on file with the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas, or such charged rates as from time to time may be filed and approved by said Corporation Commission or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the rates of the Company, its successors or assigns. (Ord. 15667 § 1, 9-23-86.)

As further consideration for the granting of this franchise, and in lieu of any City occupation, license, or revenue taxes, the Company shall pay to the City during the term of this electric franchise three percent (3%) of its gross revenue from the sale of electric energy within the corporate limits of said City. The Company shall pay to the City during the term of this natural gas franchise five percent (5%) for the first five (5) years, four percent (4%) for the second five (5) years and three percent (3%) thereafter of its gross revenue from the sale of natural gas energy within the corporate limits of said City, such payment to be made monthly for the preceding monthly period. (Ord. 15667 § 2, 9-23-86.)

Section 4. [Use, disturbance of streets, alleys, public thoroughfare.]

The Company shall, in the doing of the work in connection with its said gas mains, pipes and services, comply with Chapter 40* of the 1986 Code of the City of Topeka and its future updates and revisions regarding the use of any street, alley, avenue, easements, or other public thoroughfare, and where the Company disturbs the surface of a street, alley, avenue, or other public thoroughfare, it shall at its own expense and in a manner satisfactory to the duly authorized representatives of the City replace such paving or surface in accordance with the approved standards of the City. (Ord. 15667 § 4, 9-23-86.)

*    Editor’s Note: See TMC Title 12.


Section 5. [Delivery of natural gas.]

It is recognized that the natural gas to be delivered hereunder is to be supplied from a pipeline system transporting natural gas from distant sources of supply; and the Company, by its acceptance of this franchise as hereinafter provided, does obligate itself to furnish natural gas in such quantity and for such length of time, limited by the terms hereof, as the said sources and said pipelines are reasonably capable of supplying. (Ord. 15667 § 5, 9-23-86.)


Section 6. [Company to use reasonable and proper precaution – Hold City harmless.]

That Company, its successors and assigns, in the construction, maintenance, and operation of its electric transmission, distribution and street lighting system and its natural gas system, shall use all reasonable and proper precaution to avoid damage or injury to persons and property, and shall hold and save harmless the City from any and all damage, injury and expense caused by the sole negligence of said Company, its successors and assigns, or its or their agents or servants. (Ord. 15667 § 6, 9-23-86.)


Section 7. [Acceptance by company.]

That within sixty (60) days from and after the approval of this ordinance by the State Corporation Commission, Company shall file with the City Clerk its unconditional written acceptance of this ordinance.

(Ord. 15667 § 7, 9-23-86.)

This franchise is granted pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 12-2001, and shall not, in any way, be construed as granting the Company any exclusive franchise, right or privilege whatever. (Ord. 15667 § 9, 9-23-86.)


Section 10. [Conflicting ordinances repealed.]

That any and all ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with the terms hereof are hereby repealed. (Ord. 15667 § 10, 9-23-86.)


Section 11. [Renegotiation.]

(Ord. 15535 § 1, 10-22-85; Ord. 7694 § 1, 9-30-47.)

2.1.1 Authorization. The City hereby issues Grantee a Franchise that authorizes the Grantee to construct, operate and maintain a Cable System to provide cable service and other telecommunications services within its Franchise Area in Topeka.

Further, this authorization is not in lieu of any license required for conducting business in Topeka. This Agreement does not confer rights other than as expressly provided herein or as mandated by federal or state law.

2.1.3 Police Power.

(Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

2.11 No waiver.

2.11.1 Generally. The failure of the City, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under this Agreement, the Cable Ordinance, or any other applicable law shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance, unless such right has been specifically waived in writing.

2.11.2 Waiver Not Implied. Waiver of a breach of this Agreement or the Cable Ordinance is not a waiver of any similar or different breach. Neither the granting of this Franchise nor any provision herein shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the City, including without limitation the right of eminent domain. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


2.12 Agreement to be liberally amended.

The City shall amend this Agreement upon the application of the Grantee when necessary to enable the Grantee to take advantage of developments in the field of telecommunications that, in the opinion of the City, will afford the Grantee an opportunity to serve its customers more efficiently, effectively, and economically. Such amendments shall be subject to such conditions as are appropriate to protect the public interest. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

Grantee’s Cable System shall only be installed on the property of the Grantee, on existing pole facilities that Grantee may use under a valid pole attachment agreement or order of the City, on the property of a subscriber, in compatible easements that Grantee is entitled to use, or under the Streets of the City; installation of new poles in the Streets is forbidden without the prior written consent of the City. A Grantee’s placement of its Cable System pursuant to its Franchise shall not be deemed to give that Grantee a property interest in any particular location within the Public Streets or upon Public Property. The City reserves the right to designate where a Cable System is to be placed within the Streets and upon Public Property. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


3.2 Same – Timing.

Grantee shall begin construction to upgrade its Cable System as required by section 4 hereof by thirty (30) days after the effective date of this agreement. The upgrade must be completed by twenty-four (24) months after construction begins. Grantee is obligated to obtain all permits, licenses, approvals and contracts required in order for it [to] begin and complete construction to upgrade its System in accordance with this Agreement, and its failure to do so is a material breach of this Agreement. The City shall grant reasonable extensions of time to complete the upgrade in particular areas of the City if, prior to the scheduled time for completion, Grantee shows that, notwithstanding its due diligence, it has been unable to extend service to a specified area because the acts or omissions of a third party (not including Grantee’s subcontractors or agents) have caused a delay in construction beyond delays reasonably expected during the course of a rebuild or upgrade, and Grantee proposes a reasonable alternative deadline for extension of service to that area. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


3.3 General construction and operational practices.

3.3.1 Compliance With Standard Practices, Laws and Codes. The construction, operation and repair of Grantee’s Cable System shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. Grantee shall construct, operate and maintain its system in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and codes, including but not limited to building, zoning and other land use, and safety laws or codes now or hereafter in effect.

3.3.2 Specific Requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, the installation of any Cable System shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of the:

The City, after consultation with the Grantee, may adopt reasonable additional codes or laws as required to ensure that work continues to be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner, or to reflect changes in standards which may occur over the term of a Franchise. Amendments to existing codes or laws, or adoption of new codes or laws, shall be applicable to work performed after the effective date of the amendment or adoption, unless otherwise provided within the appropriate law or code.

3.3.4 Personnel Must Be Trained and Experienced. The construction, operation and repair of the Cable System shall be performed by experienced personnel who shall keep the Cable System in a safe and suitable condition and in good order and repair. All installations shall be durable, and use equipment of good quality. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


3.4 Protection of public and private property.

3.4.1 No Endangerment or Interference. The Grantee shall construct, operate and repair its Cable System so as not to endanger or unduly interfere with the property of the City, any gas, electric or telephone fixture or other public utility property, including any water line, hydrant or main; or the lives or property of persons; or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct use of Public Streets. It is the duty of Grantee to protect, at its expense, Public Property and private property from damage caused by the construction, operation and repair of its Cable System, and to promptly repair damage it causes, or to compensate the owner of the property for damage Grantee causes. Property so damaged shall be repaired within ten (10) days of the damage and/or compensation paid no later than within thirty (30) days of the date of the damage. Grantee shall construct, operate and maintain its System with due care for the safety and integrity of persons and property, and shall use appropriate safety devices, warning signs, barricades and lights to prevent harm to persons or property.

3.4.2 Duty to Notify. The Grantee shall notify any person whose property is damaged by the Grantee within four hours of the time the damage is discovered. At a minimum, this section requires a Grantee to place a prominent notice in a prominent place on the damaged property, and to make diligent efforts to contact the property owner or resident directly.

3.4.3 Excavation. All excavation shall be performed so as to create the least inconvenience to public, and in accordance with permits issued by the City. The City shall have the right to supervise all excavation. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


3.5 Duty to repair and compensate.

If Grantee disturbs any Public Street, Public Property or private property during the course of constructing, operating or repairing its Cable System, Grantee shall, at its own expense, replace and restore the Public Street or property to as good condition as before said work was commenced as is possible to the reasonable satisfaction of the City (in the case of Public Streets or Public Property) or the owner (in the case of private property). The Grantee shall at all times comply with the requirements of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 541 (a)(2)(A) – (C). The Public Streets, Public Property or private property affected shall be replaced or restored promptly and no later than within fifteen (15) days of the date of the disturbance. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


3.6 Duty to relocate facilities.

3.6.1 For Government. Grantee is required to remove, relay and relocate its Cable System at its own expense whenever the City or any authorized governmental body requires it to do so for reasons of traffic conditions, public health and safety, or protection of property; or because the City or authorized governmental body elects to change or alter the grade, or sell or vacate any Public Street or Public Property, to move any building or structure, or to construct, operate or repair any water pipes, lines or mains, sanitary and storm sewers, watercourses, drainage ditches, conduits, playgrounds, power lines, tracks, traffic control devices or other public improvement, public utility, public structure or facility, which change, alteration, sale, vacation, movement, construction, operation or repair will be aided by removal, relaying or relocation of Grantee’s Cable System. Grantee shall be given written notice requesting the removal, relaying or relocation of its Cable System at least twenty (20) days in advance of the date removal, relaying or relocation of the Cable System must be completed.

3.6.2 For Other Users of Rights of Way. If any removal, relaying or relocation of Grantee’s Cable System is required to accommodate the construction, operation or repair of the facilities of another person that is authorized to use the Public Streets or Public Property, Grantee shall, after twenty (20) days’ advanced written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested by the responsible entity. The expense of temporary removal, relaying or relocation as provided for in this section shall be paid by the person requesting the same.

Section 4. System Design


4.1 General system design.

4.1.1 Upgrade to 550 mHz. Grantee shall upgrade its system so that the system in its entirety uses at least 550 mHz capable equipment of high quality and reliability, and can deliver at least 500 mHz downstream to each subscriber. Grantee shall use a fiber-to-feeder architecture. The fiber optic technology will be designed and integrated into the system in a manner which permits the Grantee to take full advantage of the benefits of that technology, as described in Grantee’s April 24, 1992 proposal to the City (hereinafter “Grantee’s Proposal,” attached to the ordinance codified in this article as Appendix 1), at pages 4 through 6, including increased reliability, improved system performance and ease of expandability. The fiber optic technology will interface serving no more than 2,500 subscribers per node, with no more than seven active components in the trunk and distribution cascades off a node. The Grantee may seek a waiver or variance of these standards by providing the City with notice prior to proceeding with construction or the proposal. The City may review as provided in section 4.2.2 of this Agreement. The City shall not unreasonably object to a waiver or variance request if the waiver or variance is necessary to enable Grantee to take advantage of developments in the field of telecommunications that will afford the Grantee an opportunity to serve its customers more efficiently, effectively and economically, and that the system will continue to satisfy the needs and interests of the community. If the City acts unreasonably the Grantee may seek review in a Court of competent jurisdiction. If an appropriate objection is made, and the objection is not otherwise resolved, Grantee may make application to amend the Agreement pursuant to section 2.12 of this Agreement. If an appropriate objection is made, the objection is not otherwise resolved, a request to amend the Agreement pursuant to section 2.12 is denied, and the Grantee is in violation of this section, the City may exercise the remedies provided in section 7 of this Agreement, or federal or state law.

4.1.2 Dedicated Connections – Initially Activated.

(a) The Grantee shall install, replace as necessary, and maintain, dedicated, bidirectional fiber optic links between City Hall/Shawnee County Courthouse “complex,” the Topeka/Shawnee County Health Agency, Topeka Fire Department Headquarters, Topeka Police Department Headquarters, Washburn University, USD 501 Administrative Building, Topeka High School, Topeka West High School, and Highland Park High School to the headend and an access center designated by the City. These dedicated connections shall be designed and include all equipment, including but not limited to laser transmitters, modulators, demodulators and processors required so that each location can send signals simultaneously to the headend and the access center on at least one channel, and simultaneously can receive all public, educational, governmental and institutional use channels from the access center or the headend.

(b) In addition, Grantee shall install replace as necessary and maintain a dedicated fiber optic link between an access center to be designated by the City and the headend. This dedicated connection shall be designed and include all equipment, including but not limited to laser transmitters, modulators, demodulators and processors required so that the access center can send signals to the headend on every channel, dedicated to public, educational, governmental and institutional use (as those channels are activated); so that the access center can receive all public, educational, governmental and institutional signals (including signals sent upstream through the headend via the institutional network; or to the access center via the bidirectional links); and so that the access center can remotely (1) route signals originated at the center or at other distant locations onto any of the access channels on the regular subscriber network and (2) otherwise control the signals to allow for smooth breaks, transitions, insertion of channel ID’s and other material.

4.1.2.1 Other Locations. The City may designate other locations for the installation of equipment for use as provided in section 4.1.2 above. Grantee shall be reimbursed, without profit, for any expenses required by this subsection.

4.1.2.2 Alternate Equipment. Notwithstanding the references to fiber optic links and equipment in section 4.1.2 above, Grantee may propose to the City the use of alternate equipment to accomplish the purposes of section 4.1.2. The City shall not withhold approval of Grantee’s proposal if the technology and equipment proposed meet the needs of section 4.1.2, and if it meets the qualitative standards implied by the requirements of section 4.1.2.

4.1.3 Grantee Must Use Modern and Reliable Equipment. The Grantee shall use equipment generally used in high-quality, reliable, modern systems of similar design, including but not limited to back-up power supplies capable of providing power to the system for a minimum of two hours in the event of an electrical outage; and including but not limited to modulators, antennae, amplifiers, and other electronics which permit and are capable of passing through the signals received at the headend with minimal alteration or deterioration. This obligation shall include the obligation: (1) to install equipment to retransmit in stereo satellite and local broadcast signals provided in stereo; (2) to provide back-up power supplies at each fiber optic node receiver and the headend; (3) to bond and ground the Cable System; (4) to properly ground all antennas, satellite receive stations and other exposed equipment; and (5) to properly waterproof the Cable System, install adequate thermal expansion loops and to hold coaxial cable splices to a minimum. All splices and connectors will be of integral sleeve type. House-drop cable will be double-shielded with a layer of foil and 67 percent braid coverage.

4.1.4 Headend. The Grantee shall install equipment so that the Cable System headend is capable of providing at least 80 plus channels in full configuration and will develop signals of high quality throughout the service area (including on channels retransmitting upstream signals received through the headend). All indoor headend components will be in an adequately air-conditioned and ventilated environment.

4.1.5 Emergency Alert System. The Grantee will install an emergency alert system in the Cable System headend that can override the video and audio portion of each cable channel and substitute an audio emergency message. The Grantee will install the emergency alert system and provide for a dedicated connection so that the system can be activated remotely by the City or its designee. The City will hold the Grantee, it agents, employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the City’s use of the emergency alert system.

4.1.6 Microwave Links. If Grantee uses microwave links to receive any signals, those facilities must meet the standards set forth in the FCC Regulations for Microwave Operations, specifically Part 78 of 47 CFR Ch. 1 for Cable Television Relay Service. At the City’s request, Grantee must perform testing to determine whether the facilities are in compliance with these standards. Grantee must ensure that the system is maintained at least in accord with the manufacturer’s specifications, and consistent with Grantee’s obligation to perform preventative maintenance. It is the Grantee’s responsibility to assure that any microwave facilities used to receive the signals meet or exceed these standards at all times, whether or not the facilities are owned or operated by the Grantee. Meeting the standards set forth in this section does not excuse Grantee from meeting other technical standards established by its Franchise.

4.1.7 Interruptions During Upgrade – Notice – Refunds. The Grantee must plan the upgrade of its system so that interruptions of service be minimized. All splicing and cut-over will be performed during normal working hours and no service may be left unrestored overnight. An individual address shall not be affected more than three days by outages as a result of the cut-over of service. In addition to providing notice before it enters onto property, Grantee will provide notice that it intends to interrupt service in a particular area at least by (a) running at least a one-half page advertisement in a daily newspaper at least once during the three days prior to the date cut-over is to begin in that area; and (b) running a text announcement that it intends to interrupt service on its Cable System every day for the three days prior to the date cut-over begins. Alternatively, the Grantee may announce the anticipated interruption by notifying all subscribers in affected area by door hangings or other personal notifications reasonably calculated to provide the subscribers with actual notice. This notification shall occur at least five days prior to the cut-over. The advertisement, and announcement or other notification must identify the area where service is likely to be interrupted, must state that subscribers whose service is interrupted may obtain refunds for interrupted service by calling the Grantee, and must list a telephone number that can be called to request refunds or further information. Subscribers interrupted pursuant to this section shall be entitled to a refund if service is interrupted for more than one hour between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., or during a planned outage (with notice to subscribers as provided above) of eight (8) hours or more during a twenty-four (24) hour period, not to exceed two (2) days of such. When such interruptions occur Grantee shall automatically provide a credit to the subscriber’s account equal to 1/30 of the monthly charge for any service tier affected by the outage, and 1/30 of the charge for any service sold on a per-program basis. Except as otherwise provided in this section, refunds shall be determined as provided in the Consumer Protection Policies and Standards, specifically section eight (8) et seq. of those standards.

4.1.8 Notice Before Entry Onto Property. Grantee shall notify residents in any construction area at least one day in advance before first entering onto property to perform any work in conjunction with system construction, and shall additionally notify affected residents in advance of any work which will involve excavation, replacement of poles, or tree trimming.

4.1.9 Compatibility with Consumer Equipment. Grantee, to the extent practical, shall install equipment and construct its system so that, except for premium or pay-per-view services, a subscriber can use all features such as remote control units for VCR and television set for simultaneous viewing and recording on different channels.

4.1.10 Telephone Monitoring Equipment. Grantee shall install such devices as are required to enable the City to determine whether the Grantee is complying with each and every standard for customer telephone service, as amended from time to time. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

The entire plant will be inspected for signal egress on at least a quarterly basis. The Grantee shall maintain records of all tests performed.

4.4.2 Replacement Components. In addition to its other obligations, Grantee shall use replacement components of good and durable quality, with characteristics better or equal to replaced equipment. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.5 System performance.

The City may establish and regulate technical standards for Grantee’s Cable System to the fullest extent permitted by federal law and regulations, and reserves the right to seek such waivers or authorizations as may be required to assert that authority. The System shall, at a minimum, meet the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section 76.601 et seq. (“FCC Rules”), and shall be operated, maintained and upgraded to satisfy those standards, as they may be amended. The City shall have the authority to enforce the FCC Rules. If the FCC Rules are eliminated and not replaced, the City may continue to enforce the Rules which existed prior to the date of elimination. If the City has authority to establish standards, standards may be amended or added in conjunction with and subject to Section 8.5 et seq., Periodic Review. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.6 Initial and continuing tests.

The Grantee shall perform all tests necessary to ensure that the equipment it installs is free from defect, and to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the FCC Rules and any other applicable technical standards established by state or federal law or under the Franchise. All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the FCC Rules and with the most current edition of Tektronix, “No Loose Ends,” and/or NCTA’s, “Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems.” Grantee shall, at a minimum, do the following:

4.6.1 Preconstruction Quality Control. The Grantee shall perform a preconstruction quality test on random samples of system components as required to determine whether equipment being provided meets manufacturer’s specifications. All new trunk and distribution cable shall be sweep tested on the reel to verify compliance with manufacturer’s specification of frequency response and structural return loss. No component shall be used in the system which fails to meet the manufacturer’s specification.

4.6.2 Acceptance Tests. The Grantee shall perform acceptance tests on the entire system at the conclusion of the upgrade to demonstrate compliance with the FCC Rules and any other applicable technical standards established by state or federal law or under the Franchise. The City has the option of witnessing the tests. The test results shall be submitted to the City for review.

4.6.3 Test Points. To assist in oversight of the Grantee’s performance, Grantee and the City will jointly select test points at various points of the system. The quantity of these test points will be mutually agreed upon based on what best represents the architecture of the system, but there shall be no fewer than the number of test points required consistent with FCC regulations. The Grantee shall perform proof of performance tests at these locations annually, and at other points where system user complaints indicate tests are warranted or as required to test all major trunk lines. The City shall have the option of witnessing the tests. A written report of the test results shall be filed with City within 30 days of the test.

4.6.4 Correction of Deficiencies. If a location fails to meet the technical standards set forth in the FCC Rules, or any other applicable technical standards established by state or federal law or under the Franchise, whether the failure is identified as a result of tests performed under this Agreement or otherwise, the Grantee, without requirement of additional notice or request from City, shall take corrective action, re-test the locations and advise the City of the action taken and results achieved. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.7 Provision of service to subscribers – System extension.

4.7.1 System Capabilities. Grantee shall build its system so that it is capable of providing service to all businesses and residences located within its Franchise Area.

4.7.2 Extension of Service. Service shall be extended for no more than otherwise applicable installation charges except as provided in this section 4.7.

4.7.3 Additional Charges for Certain Underground Drops. Where Grantee is allowed by this Franchise to locate a drop above ground, but the Subscriber requests to locate his or her cable drop underground, the Grantee shall locate the drop underground, but in addition to the applicable installation charge may charge the Subscriber for the actual difference in cost of installing the underground, rather than the aerial drop.

4.7.4 Additional Charges for Drops of Certain Lengths. Where the drop to the subscriber home is more than 150 feet in length, in addition to the applicable installation charge, Grantee may charge the subscriber the difference between Grantee’s cost of installing a 150 foot drop and the cost of installing a longer drop. (Drop length shall be the shorter of the length of the actual drop installed or the length of the drop that would have been required to the nearest point to which Grantee could be required to extend its System.)

4.7.5 Additional Charges for Certain Extensions. For areas annexed after the effective date of this Franchise and/or areas not within the contiguous boundary of the City, where the person requesting service is more than 500 feet of distance from the existing System (where overhead may be used) or 250 feet of distance from the existing System (where underground must be used); and there is an average density of less than 10 potential Subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, measured from all points on the System to the point to which the System must be extended to serve the person requesting service, Grantee must extend service if the person or persons requesting service are willing to make a capital contribution in aid of construction to cover actual cost of material and labor, in accordance with the formula set forth herein. Grantee must bear material and labor costs in an amount equal to the material and labor costs per quarter mile, multiplied by the length of the extension in quarter miles, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential Subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 10. Persons requesting service will bear the remainder of the material and labor costs on a pro rata basis. Grantee may require that the estimated payment of a potential subscriber’s share of the capital contribution aid of construction be paid in advance. Any excess amounts collected in advance must be returned to the subscriber.

4.7.6 Verification of Charges for Extension. Copies of itemized invoices shall be sent to Subscribers for the material and labor used in any System extension immediately after the extension is completed, along with a calculation showing the Company’s and the Subscriber’s share of those costs and any advance payments by the Subscriber. A copy of the invoice shall be furnished to the City at the same time the invoice is sent to the Subscriber.

4.7.7 Time for Provision of Service. Until the upgrade required [in] section 4.1 is substantially completed, Grantee must provide service to any person requesting it within five business days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a standard drop. Upon substantial completion of the System upgrade, service must be provided to any person requesting it within three business days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a standard drop. Service must be provided within ten business days of the request for a nonstandard drop. Where an extension of the distribution system is required to provide service, service must be provided (1) within 30 days of the request where an extension of one-half mile or less is required or, regardless of distance, where the extension is in response to a request for service from any person who is located within the City limits as those limits existed on the effective date of this Agreement; or (2) in other cases, within six months of the request.

4.7.8 Drops to Public Buildings. Grantee shall install one drop at no charge to every school and fire station within the Service Area and to City Hall. Grantee may charge for Cable Service delivered over that drop, except as otherwise provided in this Franchise. However, the City and the schools may install facilities and equipment to transmit the signal to all rooms within a building, and shall not be required to pay any more for service than the Grantee charges for delivery to a single drop point to a residential subscriber. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.8 Public, educational and governmental use – Channel capacity.

In addition to the capacity required by section 4.1:

4.8.1 Number of Channels. Grantee shall set aside four downstream channels, one for noncommercial public access, two for educational access, one for governmental access. These channels, and the facilities and equipment associated with them are referred to in this Agreement as “PEG” use channels, facilities or equipment. Two of those channels, one dedicated for educational use and one dedicated for government use, were provided under Grantee’s prior franchise. Those channels will continue to be dedicated to educational and government use for the term of this Franchise. The remaining two channels (one for noncommercial public and the other for educational use) shall be activated on the day any portion of the upgraded system is activated, but no later than June 1, 1995. In addition, Grantee shall provide at least ten downstream channels for educational, governmental and public nonprofit institutional use. Scrambling should be incorporated into the downstream channels. The system shall be designed so that programming transmitted upstream on capacity provided under section 4.1.3 can be routed onto the channels set aside for public, educational and governmental access and/or dedicated lines.

4.8.2 No Charge for Channels. There shall be no charge for use of this channel capacity, or the capacity required by section 4.1.2, 4.1.3 or 4.1.4.

4.8.3 Use of Channels. When the PEG use channels are not being used to carry programming provided by other access users, the City or its designee, at their sole cost and expense, shall have the right to back-up PEG programming with other programming, consistent with promoting public, educational and governmental use of the channels. This paragraph shall not limit Grantee’s rights, if any, under 47 U.S.C. § 531(d). (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.9 PEG use – Equipment and facilities.

Grantee shall provide for PEG use equipment and facilities the following:

4.9.1 Initial Equipment Grant. Grantee shall provide an initial equipment grant of $450,000.00. One Hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) of this amount must be paid to the City on the effective date of this Agreement and the remainder must be paid to the City within 30 days of a written request submitted by the City any time after July 1, 1993. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.10 PEG use – Management, rules and procedures.

4.10.1 Management of Channels. The City, by resolution, may designate one or more entities, including a non-profit access management corporation, to manage the use of all or part of the PEG channels and the channels designated for institutional use. However, unless the City provides otherwise by resolution, the government access channel now provided shall be managed by the City, the educational channels now provided by Grantee shall be managed by Washburn University, and the educational use channel that will be provided upon activation of any portion of the upgraded system shall be managed by USD 501. During any period where there is no designee managing the use of particular channels, the City shall manage those channels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City at any time may require shared use of any channel capacity dedicated for public, educational or governmental use.

4.10.2 Rules for Use of Channels, Facilities and Equipment. The entity responsible for managing a channel shall establish and enforce rules for use of the PEG channels, facilities and equipment under its control to (i) to assure nondiscriminatory access to the channels, facilities and equipment to similarly situated users eligible to use the channel, facilities or equipment; and (ii) to promote use and viewership of the channel, consistent with the obligation to provide nondiscriminatory access.

4.10.3 Grantee May Not Control Content. Except as specifically required by Federal or State law, the Grantee agrees that it will not exercise any editorial control over the content of programming on the dedicated lines or PEG use channels (except for such programming the Grantee may produce and cablecast on the same basis as other PEG channel users). (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.11 PEG use – General.

The parties agree that any cost to Grantee associated with providing access services, facilities and equipment under this Franchise, and payments made outside this Franchise, if any, are not part of the franchise fee, and fall within one or more of the exceptions to 47 U.S.C. § 542. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


4.12 Leased use.

4.12.1 Number of Channels. The Grantee shall provide leased access channels as required under the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended.

4.12.2 Reservation of Rights. In the event the leased access requirements of Cable Act change, the City may require Grantee to continue to provide channels it was required to provide under the Cable Act, if consistent with federal law.

4.12.3 Regulation By City. To the extent permitted by federal law, the City may regulate terms and conditions for leased use of the channels; may require the Grantee to provide leased users access to system facilities, equipment and services under reasonable terms and conditions; (except as provided in section 4.13) may require the Grantee to attach or interconnect its system to equipment and facilities to facilitate leased use of the channels, under reasonable terms and conditions and may establish other rules and regulations to promote leased use of the channels.

4.12.4 Leased Access Records. The operator shall maintain a file showing the terms and conditions under which it provided services, facilities, equipment and channels to leased users. The file shall, at a minimum, show the lease price, all compensation to the lessor (including compensation in cash, in-kind services, facilities and equipment, or by barter), and the nature of the lessee, or its programming, if considered in establishing the lease term and conditions.

The evaluation and a decision concerning the request shall be completed within ninety (90) days of the interconnection request. Grantee shall state in writing whether or not it is willing to interconnect and if so under what terms interconnection would be acceptable. If Grantee refuses or agree only upon terms not acceptable to the other party(ies) both City and Grantee shall be accorded whatever legal rights each may have at the time, including judicial review.

Section 5. Customer Services and Rates


5.1 Minimum customer service standards.

5.1.1 Standards – Generally. Grantee must meet or exceed requirements for customer service established by the City in accordance with the Cable Ordinance, and any federal or state customer service requirements, to the extent those federal or state requirements are stricter or address issues not addressed or only partially addressed by the City’s customer service standards. Initially, Grantee shall meet or exceed the customer service standards appended to the ordinance codified in this article as Attachment A. The City may revise these customer service standards as part of the periodic review contemplated by Section 8.5, or as it deems necessary to address issues not addressed or only partially addressed in those standards. Nothing in this section shall be read to limit the City’s right to adopt other consumer protection laws.

5.1.2 Maintenance and Complaints.

5.1.2.1 Grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.

5.1.2.2 Complaints concerning billing, employee courtesy, programming, safety or Grantee’s operational policies, as well as all other complaints, including complaints about outages, signal quality and service disruptions, shall be recorded. For purposes of this section a customer request for information shall not be considered a complaint. Grantee must maintain records of complaints for five (5) years. Copies of the complaint records shall be provided to the City on request. If it is required to do so by federal law, Grantee may remove all information which identifies specific customers, but it is Grantee’s responsibility to provide privacy notices so that complaint information is, as far as possible, fully available to the City.

5.1.2.3 Grantee shall maintain a sufficient repair force of technicians to respond promptly to Subscriber complaints, loss of service, or requests for service. Grantee shall have in place at all time the equipment required to locate and correct system malfunctions.

5.1.2.4 All Subscribers and members of the general public in the City may direct complaints and inquiries regarding Grantee’s service or performance to the Grantee or the City. Complaints directed to the City shall be forwarded to Grantee within three days of receipt by the City for attempted resolution. For any complaint which the Grantee and the complaining party are unable to resolve to the complaining party’s satisfaction after 14 days, and upon the request of the complaining party or the Grantee, the City’s Chief Administrative Officer or designee shall act as a board of review of a complaint or dispute, and recommend action for resolution. A Grantee may not disconnect service to any Subscriber until the complaint or dispute is resolved. It may not levy or accrue late charges, administrative charges or other, similar charges during the first fourteen (14) days the complaint or dispute is pending review or until the complaint or dispute is resolved, whichever occurs first. Any charges or fees thereafter levied or assessed shall be immediately refunded with interest if the complaint or dispute is resolved in the subscriber’s favor. Interest shall be at the rate established for judgments in the State of Kansas. A Grantee’s good faith or lack thereof in attempting to resolve complaints in a fair and equitable manner will be considered in connection with any renewal application filed by the Grantee.

5.1.2.5 In the event a complaint or dispute directed to it is determined by the City to be a potential violation of this Agreement or the Cable Ordinance, and after written notification to Grantee of that determination, the City may exercise any of its other rights and remedies under this Agreement or the Cable Ordinance.

5.1.3 Nondiscrimination.

5.1.3.1 Grantee shall not, in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or grant undue preferences or advantages to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers, nor shall a Grantee subject any such persons or group of persons to any undue prejudice or any disadvantage; provided, however, a Grantee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers provided that such discounts are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the City. A Grantee shall not deny, delay, or otherwise burden service or discriminate against subscribers within its Franchise Area or users on the basis of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, marital status, or political affiliation, except for discounts for the elderly or handicapped that are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.

5.1.3.2 Grantee shall not deny cable service to any group of potential subscribers because of the income of the residents of the area in which the group resides. No “redlining” will be tolerated.

5.1.3.3 Grantee shall not refuse to employ, nor discharge from employment, nor discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, marital status, or political affiliation. The Grantee shall comply with federal, state and local laws governing equal employment opportunities.

5.1.3.4 Grantee shall not discriminate against minority-owned businesses, in contracting for or otherwise procuring goods or services. Grantee shall use its best efforts to purchase goods and services from minority-owned businesses. Within 45 days of the effective date of its Franchise, and before letting any contract for the construction, upgrade or rebuild of the Cable System required hereunder, Grantee shall develop an Affirmative Action Plan which shall include at least the following elements: (1) detailed plans for advising minority-owned businesses of opportunities for the provision of goods and services to Grantee; and (2) goals for use of goods and services provided by or through minority-owned businesses. The fact that the Plan is to include these elements does not mean that the Plan is to be restricted to these elements. The Affirmative Action Plan shall be regularly reviewed by the Grantee for effectiveness. Failure to meet any goal established in the Affirmative Action Plan will not in itself be deemed proof that Grantee is discriminating against minority-owned businesses, but may be reviewed by the City as one factor (along with its hiring and procurement practices) in determining whether Grantee is in compliance with its obligation not to discriminate. City may review the Affirmative Action plan, and any revisions upon request.

5.1.4 Parental Control Device. Upon request, Grantee shall provide parental control devices to any subscriber. Grantee shall charge no more than its cost for the parental control devices it provides. Grantee must provide subscribers an opportunity to obtain the device within thirty (30) days of initial installation or subscription to the cable system. No additional installation charge may be made for this service if obtained within thirty (30) days of initial installation or subscription. The Grantee may charge a reasonable installation fee if the parental control device is obtained after thirty (30) days of the initial installation or subscription. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


5.2 Rate regulation.

5.2.1 City May Regulate. The City may regulate the rates for the provision of service, but only to the extent doing so is consistent with Federal law concerning cable television systems and Federal Communications Commission regulations promulgated thereunder. Nothing herein expands or restricts the rights of either party with respect to any modification, amendments or repeal of 47 U.S.C. § 543 or any FCC regulation promulgated thereunder, or state law or regulations promulgated thereunder.

5.2.2 Schedule of Rates and Charges. Grantee shall file a schedule of all its rates and charges with the City on the effective date of its Franchise.

5.2.3 Notice of Changes to Rates and Services. As a matter of consumer protection, at least 60 days prior to implementing any changes in rate levels, services or service terms, a Grantee shall provide the City written notice describing any changes it plans to make and the proposed effective dates for the changes. At least 45 days prior to implementing any changes in rate level, services or service terms and conditions, a Grantee must provide each affected subscriber notice, describing the changes it plans to make and the proposed effective dates for the changes. Any change made without the required notice shall be of no legal force or effect.

5.2.4 Submission of Rate for Review. Grantee shall be required to submit any change in rates or charges to the City for approval prior to implementing that change, to the extent a Grantee may be required to do so consistent with federal laws and regulation. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

The City may raise the franchise fee, if so permitted by Federal and State law, to eight (8) percent of gross revenues as defined. Prior to implementation of any increase in franchise fees the Grantee may request, and will be granted a public hearing to discuss said increase with the citizens of the City. The City may require the implementation of such increase in accord with the provisions of this agreement. Increases beyond this amount shall be the subject of good faith negotiations with the Grantee.

Each payment shall be accompanied by a statement of revenue received for the quarter in connection with the operation of the Grantee’s System in the City and a brief report showing the basis for computation of fees. The reports shall list a line item for every source of revenue from the operation of the Grantee’s Cable System received by Grantee, any affiliate of Grantee or any other entity that is a cable operator of the Grantee’s Cable System, whether or not Grantee believes the revenue source should be included in the franchise fee calculation; list the revenues received for each line item; and, if Grantee omits any revenue from the franchise fee calculation, an explanation of the reason for the omission. Each statement shall be certified by a certified public accountant or the Grantee’s chief financial officer. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


6.3 No accord or satisfaction.

No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable under a Franchise by a Grantee. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


6.4 Late payments.

Interest shall be paid on any late payments at a rate equal to the judgment rate of interest established by the State of Kansas. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


6.5 Not in lieu of other fees, taxes or assessments.

The Franchise Fee shall be paid in addition to any other fees, charges or assessments of (including, but not limited to, business license fees), unless such fee, charge or assessment must be treated as a Franchise Fee under the Cable Act. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


6.6 Right to audit.

The City shall have authority to arrange for and conduct an audit of the financial records of Grantee, its contractors or subcontractors, affiliates or any cable operator of the Grantee’s System for the purpose of verifying Franchise Fee payments. The City will notify Grantee in writing at least seven (7) days prior to the date of the audit, and Grantee shall make available for inspection and copying its books and records, and those of any affiliate or other entity as may be relevant to the determination of gross revenues and Franchise Fees due. The records shall be made available by a Grantee at Grantee’s expense at City Hall, or such other location as the City and a Grantee may agree. However, Grantee shall retain any proprietary interest in these documents and, to the extent permitted under Kansas and federal law, and except as may be necessary to enforce the City’s rights or Grantee’s obligations under its Franchise, the documents shall not be considered open records subject to disclosure to members of the general public or to Grantee’s competitors. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


6.7 Payment on termination.

If Grantee’s Franchise terminates for any reason (including through the issuance of a renewal or superseding franchise), Grantee shall file with the City within ninety (90) calendar days of the date its operations in the City cease under that Franchise a financial statement, certified by a certified public accountant or the Grantee’s chief financial officer, showing the gross revenues received by Grantee since the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments will be made at that time for Franchise Fees due to the date that the Grantee’s operations under the terminated Franchise cease. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

Recovery by the City of any amounts under sections 7.1 through 7.3 shall not in any respect limit a Grantee’s duty to indemnify the City under section 7.5; nor shall recovery of any amounts in any respect prevent the City from imposing penalties under Kansas law, or exercising any other right or remedy it may have under the Franchise or at law or equity. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


7.5 Indemnification.

Grantee shall, at its sole expense, fully indemnify, and hold harmless the City, and in their capacity as such, the officers, agents and employees thereof, from and against any and all claims, suits, and actions, liability and judgment for damages or otherwise arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the Cable System, or in any way arising out of Grantee’s enjoyment or exercise of this Franchise, whether the act or omission giving rise to the same is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Franchise or applicable law. This duty includes the duty to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the City, its officers, agents and employees in defending themselves, including but not limited to all out-of-pocket expenses, and attorneys fees for outside counsel (if Grantee or the City determines that the interests of the Grantee and the City conflict). (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


7.6 Remedies.

7.6.0 Revocation. In addition to all other rights, powers and remedies reserved by the City, the City shall have the additional, separate and distinct rights to revoke the Franchise, if:

(a) The Grantee becomes fiscally unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is judged to be bankrupt;

(b) The Grantee attempts to or does practice any material fraud or deceit in its conduct in obtaining the Franchise or operating under it;

(c) The Grantee attempts to evade any material provision of this Franchise or applicable law relating to the construction, operation or repair of this Cable System;

(d) The Grantee materially violates the terms of its Franchise. Without limitation, the failure of a Grantee to comply with the deadlines established in its Franchise, or its failure to provide or maintain the required reports and records shall be deemed a material violation of its Franchise; or

(e) The Grantee abandons its Franchise. Grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned its Franchise if it wilfully refuses to operate the Cable System as required by its Franchise, when there is no event beyond Grantee’s control that prevents the operation of the Cable System, and where operation would not endanger the health or safety of the public or property.

7.6.1 Liquidated Damages. Because Grantee’s failure to comply with provisions of this Franchise will result in injury to the City, and because it will be difficult to estimate the extent of such injury, in certain cases the City and Grantee hereby agree to the following liquidated damages, which represent both parties’ best estimate of the damages resulting from the specified injury. To maintain that estimate, the parties agree that the liquidated damage amounts are in 1993 dollars and shall be increased each year by the increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), Regions [i.e. North Central], all items, Standard Reference Base Period 1982 – 1984 = 100, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics.

7.6.1.2 For transferring the franchise without approval: $500/day for each day the violation continues;

7.6.1.3 For failure to comply with requirements for public, educational, and government use of system: $250/day for each day the violation continues;

7.6.1.4 For repeated, willful, or continuing violation of customer service standards, except for those set forth below: $150 per violation;

7.6.1.5 In each case where the Grantee’s performance over a calendar year fails to meet or exceed the performance standards in section 3.2 et seq. of the Customer Service Standards, $1,000 for each month of that year in which the percentage standard was not met;

7.6.1.6 For all other material violations for which actual damages may not be ascertainable, $200/day for each day violation continues. The payment of any liquidated damages shall not relieve the Grantee of its obligation to comply with the Franchise.

7.6.2 Same – Remedies Cumulative. All remedies under the Cable Ordinance or this Agreement shall be cumulative, unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall it relieve Grantee of its obligations to comply with the Franchise. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; in addition, the City may exercise any rights it has under law or at equity. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


7.7 Procedures prior to exercise of certain remedies.

7.7.1 Applicability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, before exercising its rights under sections 7.2 and 7.3, or collecting liquidated damages owed under section 7.6.1, or imposing any penalty as provided under Kansas law, the City shall follow the procedures set forth in this section 7.7.

7.7.2 Procedures. Should the City believe that Grantee may have violated its Franchise or applicable law, the City shall give written notice to the Grantee informing it of such alleged violation (“Violation Notice”). Within fourteen days of the date of the Violation Notice, the Grantee must send a written notice to the City advising the City that (1) the Grantee intends to contest the Violation; or (2) the Grantee has completely corrected the violation, and describing in detail the steps taken to correct it; or (3) the Grantee has begun to correct the Violation, but that, with all due diligence the Violation cannot be corrected in fourteen days, and describing in detail steps already taken and the Grantee’s plan and precise schedule for correcting the Violation. If the Grantee intends to contest the Violation, or the City finds that the Grantee may have failed to cure or submit an acceptable plan for curing the default in performance, the City shall schedule a meeting where the operator shall be asked to show cause why it should not be found in violation of the Franchise. At least 20 days notice shall be given prior to such meeting. Notice shall be given to conform to any state law notice requirements. If, after the meeting, the City finds that the Grantee is in violation of the Franchise and has failed to correct the default in performance (or the default cannot be cured), it may exercise any right it has under sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.6. Correction is not complete until all penalties and damages, if any are owed, are paid.


7.8 Continuity of service.

7.8.1 Subscribers Entitled to Continuous Service. All subscribers in Grantee’s Franchise Area are entitled to receive all available services from Grantee as long as their financial and other obligations to the Grantee are satisfied.

7.8.2 Duty to Provide Continuity of Service. In the event of the termination or transfer of Grantee’s Franchise, the Grantee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances in accordance with this section 7.8. At the City’s request, a Grantee shall cooperate with the City to operate its Cable System for a temporary period (the “Transition Period”) following termination or transfer of the Franchise as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers, and shall cooperate in the development of plans required to ensure an orderly transition from one operator to another. The Transition Period will be no longer than a reasonable period (not to exceed thirty-six (36) months unless extended by the City for good cause) required to select another Grantee and build a replacement System. During such Transition Period, the Cable System shall be operated as if the terms and conditions of this Franchise continued to apply, including any provisions related to the regulation of rates, to the extent permitted by federal and state law.

7.8.3 Failure to Operate. In the event Grantee fails to operate the system for ninety-six (96) hours during any seven (7) day period without prior approval of the City, or if the System is abandoned as defined in section 7.6.0, the City may, at its option, operate the system, obtain an injunction requiring Grantee to continue operations, or designate an operator until such time as the Grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the City or until the Franchise is revoked and a permanent operator is providing service. If the City is required to fulfill this obligation for the Grantee, the Grantee shall reimburse the City for all costs or damages resulting from the Grantee’s failure to perform that are in excess of the revenues from the Cable System received by the City. Additionally, the Grantee will cooperate with the City to allow City employees and/or City agents free access to the Grantees’ facilities and premises for purposes of continuing system operation. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


7.9 Termination.

7.9.1 Removal of Wires. Upon revocation or cancellation of Grantee’s Franchise, or upon any other termination of its Franchise by passage of time or otherwise, the City shall have the right to require Grantee to remove, at Grantee’s own expense, its Cable System from Public Streets and Public Property, and any private property occupied pursuant to the terminated Franchise. The City shall notify the Grantee in writing that the Cable System should be removed, and identify any period during which the Grantee will be required to continue to operate the System as provided in section 7.8. In removing its Cable System, Grantee shall refill and compact, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made and shall leave all Public Streets, Public Property, and private property, in as good a condition as that prevailing prior to Grantee’s removal of its System. The Insurance, Indemnity and Damage provisions of Grantee’s Franchise shall remain in full force and effect until the System is removed.

7.9.2 City Right to Purchase. Upon revocation or cancellation of a Grantee’s Franchise, or upon any other termination of this Franchise by passage of time or otherwise, the City shall have the right to buy the Grantee’s System, if the Grantee has failed, within the transition period provided for in section 7.8.2, to transfer or sell the system to an operator who has been approved by the City subject to the transfer provisions of this chapter. If the Franchise has been revoked or terminated for cause the City may purchase the System at an equitable price, as that term is used in Section 627(b) of the Cable Act. If renewal of the Franchise is denied or the Franchise is terminated as otherwise provided by this Chapter, the City may purchase the system at fair market value, determined on the basis of the System valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the Franchise itself.

7.9.3 Time for Removal. If the City does not purchase a Grantee’s Cable System as provided in section 7.9.2, and a Grantee has failed to commence removal of its System, within ninety (90) days after termination of the Franchise, or such other date specified by the City under section 7.8.2, or if that Grantee has failed to complete such removal within nine months after removal is required to have begun, the City may:

7.9.3.1 Declare all right, title and interest to that Grantee’s Cable System to be in City or its delegatee with all right of ownership including, but not limited to, the right to operate the Cable System or transfer the Cable System to another for operation by it. Upon such declaration by City, a Grantee shall be entitled to receive an equitable price from the City for the value of the System, less any costs and damages suffered by the City as a result of the delay in removal.

7.9.3.2 Declare the Cable System abandoned and cause the Cable System, or such part thereof as the City shall designate, to be removed at no cost to City. The cost of said removal shall be recoverable from the Insurance and Indemnity sections provided herein, or from the Grantee directly.

7.9.4 Sale to Third Party. Nothing in sections 7.9.1 or 7.9.3 shall prevent the Grantee from selling its system to a third party during any Transition Period, or from selling unabandoned assets in place prior to their removal, provided that, any successor in interest shall be bound and must agree to be bound by all the obligations of the Grantee under this section 7, including specifically its obligation to remove or abandon facilities as provided in section 7.9.3. Every such sale or other assignment shall be subject to the review of the City. The City must agree to approve any such sale or other assignment with a buyer if a buyer:

7.9.4.1 Agrees in writing to comply with the terms of sections 7.8 and 7.9 and to assume and be bound by all of Grantee’s obligations under this sections 7.8 and 7.9, including the obligation to comply with all provisions of the Franchise as if it were still in force; and

7.9.4.2 Agrees in writing to waive any claim or defense that, as a result of the assignment or otherwise, it has a right to operate or maintain the cable system except as provided in sections 7.8 and 7.9, to construct a new System without a franchise, to obtain a new franchise for the System or to renew any authorization to operate or maintain the System under 47 U.S.C. § 546 or otherwise. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

Section 8. Monitoring Performance


8.1 Books and records.

The City may inspect and copy the books, records, maps, plans and other documents, including financial documents in the control or possession of a Grantee, its contractors, subcontractors and affiliates, or any person that constitutes a cable operator of a Grantee’s Cable System (1) to enforce the City’s rights or assess compliance with the Grantee’s Franchise and applicable law; (2) in the exercise of any lawful regulatory power; or (3) as is reasonably necessary and relevant in connection with any proceeding the City may or must conduct under applicable law with respect to Grantee’s System. Notwithstanding the Cable Ordinance, the material shall be produced at City Hall unless the documents requested are too voluminous or for security reasons cannot be moved, in which case they shall be made available for inspection and copying at the Grantee’s local business office. If the documents are provided at the Grantee’s local business office, Grantee must bear the City’s travel costs and arrange for and bear the costs associated with expeditiously copying documents. Material that the City requires the Grantee to produce under this section 8.1 shall be produced upon reasonable notice and no later than 30 days after the request for production.

Grantee shall be responsible for clearly and conspicuously stamping the word “confidential” on each page that contains proprietary information; and separating documents containing confidential information from those that do not at the time the documents are provided to the City. At the City’s request, the Grantee will explain the basis for any claim that a particular page contains proprietary information. The City shall promptly notify Grantee if any person requests access to documents or information under the Kansas Open Records Act, or if the City determines that it will be necessary to reveal the information or documents in the discharge of its obligations under the franchise and applicable law, so that Grantee may take appropriate steps as may be available to protect any rights it may claim to have to prevent disclosure.

Material obtained pursuant to this section shall generally be considered proprietary to the Grantee if the material would be proprietary under federal or state rules of evidence, and such material shall not be disclosed to members of the general public or Grantee’s competitors, except where necessary to comply with obligations under federal or state law, or under the Cable Ordinance or this Agreement. The information requested shall be provided within 30 days of request. Requests for extensions of time to respond shall not be unreasonably denied. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

The City shall promptly notify Grantee if any person requests access to documents or information under the Kansas Open Records Act, or if the City determines that it will be necessary to reveal the information or documents in the discharge of its obligations under the franchise and applicable law, so that Grantee may take appropriate steps as may be available to protect any rights it may claim to have to prevent disclosure. The records shall be kept at Grantee’s local office and shall be available for City review and, except as specifically noted above, copying during normal business hours. Records kept in compliance with this section shall be kept for at least five years. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


8.4 Inspection of plant.

The City may inspect Grantee’s Cable System during the upgrade, and upon completion of the upgrade, shall have the right to inspect the Cable System and Grantee’s equipment used in the maintenance of that System during normal business hours. If based on subscriber complaints, or based on its own investigation, the City believes that the Cable System may not be operating in compliance with this Franchise, it may require a Grantee to perform tests, and to prepare a report to the City on the results of those tests, including a report identifying any problem found and steps taken to correct the problem. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


8.5 Periodic review.

8.5.1 Four-Year Reviews.

a. During the years which commence on the fourth, eighth, and twelfth anniversaries of the effective date of the Franchise, the City may commence a review of Grantee’s performance under the Franchise. As part of this review, the City may consider: (1) whether Grantee has complied with its obligations under the Franchise and applicable law; (2) whether customer service standards, bond or security fund requirements are adequate or excessive; and (3) other issues as may be raised by Grantee, the City or the public.

b. The City shall conduct public hearings to provide Grantee and the public the opportunity to comment on Grantee’s performance and other issues considered as part of the four-year review.

8.5.2 Five-Year Reviews – Technological Changes.

a. During each of the years which commence on the fifth, and tenth anniversaries of the effective date of the Franchise, the City may commence a review to determine whether Grantee has satisfied its obligation to respond to community needs and interest by incorporating technological advances into its system through upgrades and rebuilds as provided in section 4.15, including whether Grantee has maintained a reasonable level of services in light of technological advances in the industry and taking into account the cost of meeting community needs and interests.

b. The City shall conduct public hearings to provide Grantee and the public the opportunity to comment on the issues which are to be considered in this five-year review.

c. At any time after the commencement of the five-year review, the City may require the Grantee to submit a proposal describing its plans including a timetable and costs, to incorporate technological advances into its system, consistent with the findings of the review. The City may set a deadline for submission of the paper which deadline shall provide Grantee no fewer than ninety (90) days to prepare the proposal from the date a written request for the proposal is submitted to the Grantee.

d. Following receipt of the proposal, the City and the Grantee shall negotiate in good faith to develop a plan, including a timetable, for incorporating appropriate technological changes into the system. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within ninety (90) days after receipt of the proposal the City may commence an administrative proceeding in accordance with this section to review the proposal.

e. The City shall provide prompt public notice of the administrative proceeding to consider whether the Grantee’s proposal is reasonable to meet future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.

f. In any proceeding under paragraph d., the Grantee shall be afforded adequate notice and Grantee and City shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce relevant evidence, to require the production of evidence to compel the relevant testimony of officials, agents, employees or consultants of the other, to compel the testimony of other persons as permitted by law and to question witnesses. The parties may introduce evidence regarding system design and capacity in other communities. A transcript shall be made of any proceeding.

g. The City and Grantee shall attempt to select jointly a third party to conduct the administrative hearing described above. If the parties are unable to agree upon a single hearing officer, each may select one officer and the two officers so selected shall select a third officer.

h. At the completion of a proceeding under section d., the administrative hearing officer(s) shall issue a written decision by majority vote, adopting, rejecting or modifying the proposal for rebuild or upgrade, and shall transmit a copy of the decision to the City and to the Grantee. The governing body of the City may adopt, reject or modify the decision of the hearing officer(s), and shall issue a written statement setting forth the reasons for its actions. Grantee shall be bound by the City’s decision, unless it appeals the decision within sixty (60) days of the date it is issued, under subsection i.

i. If the Grantee is adversely affected by the decision of the City, it may file an appropriate action in any court of competent jurisdiction. For purposes of that action, the parties stipulate that the record of the administrative hearing officer(s) and the City shall constitute the entire factual record. Jurisdiction shall be granted as provided in K.S.A. 60-2101(d) and amendments thereto. The scope of the court’s review shall generally be as provided in K.S.A. 77-621 and amendments thereto.

8.5.3 Five-Year Reviews – Access Equipment and Facilities.

a. During each of the years which commence on the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the effective date of the Franchise, the City may commence a review to determine whether additional facilities or equipment are appropriate to meet community needs and interests in public, educational or governmental use of cable, taking into consideration of the cost of providing the same.

b. The City shall conduct public hearings to provide Grantee and the public the opportunity to comment on the issues which are to be considered in this five-year review.

c. If the City determines that additional facilities or equipment are required for public, educational or governmental use, it may require Grantee to provide them; provided that, the City shall permit Grantee to pass-through (as a line item at Grantee’s option) the cost of providing such facilities and equipment. Unless otherwise provided by Federal law and regulations, the parties agree to use the following formula in determining the amount which is eligible for pass-through in any month during which such costs are being recovered: (cost of facilities/equipment) divided by (number of subscribers) divided by (12) divided by (number of years remaining in franchise).

8.5.4 Grantee Cooperation. The Grantee shall cooperate in the four and five-year reviews, including by submitting reports on the state of cable technology. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


8.6 Unreasonable requests.

If Grantee believes that information requested by the City need not be produced under the provisions of this Agreement or applicable law, it may seek appropriate protection from a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

Section 9. Transfers


9.1 Prior approval required.

Prior approval of the City shall be required before Grantee’s Franchise is assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet or disposed of in any manner, directly or indirectly, either by forced or involuntary sale, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise; and before title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein, passes to or vests in any person or persons. A change in control of the Grantee or any person that manages, owns or controls a Grantee is a transfer within the meaning of this section. The approval of the City shall not generally be required for a transfer by mortgage. However, Grantee must notify the City at least thirty (30) days after a part of the cable system is mortgaged. Further, a mortgage of the cable system which results in Grantee no longer managing, owning or controlling the system will be considered a transfer requiring prior application to and the approval of the City. Any transfer resulting from the default and/or foreclosure of a mortgage will likewise be considered a transfer requiring prior application and approval by the City. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


9.2 Application for transfer.

The proposed transferee shall make a written request of City for approval of the transfer. The application shall provide complete information regarding the proposed transfer, including (a) all documents embodying the transaction; (b) financing documents; (c) documents identifying any person who will be responsible, through any arrangement, for managing or controlling the Cable System; (d) documents showing that the proposed transferee has the financial, technical and legal ability to operate the Cable System after the transfer so as to satisfy all its obligations under this Franchise without, adversely affecting subscribers; (e) the information required by sections 5(b)(1), 5(b)(3) – (5), 7(a)(2) and (3), 7(a)(9), and 7(a)(11) of the Cable Ordinance; (f) any information the transferee or the transferror is required to produce to a franchising authority under applicable law. The proposed transferee shall also pay all reasonable costs incurred by the City in reviewing and evaluating the application. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


9.3 City response.

Upon receiving the transfer application, the City may seek additional information from the Grantee or the proposed Transferee, as reasonably required to evaluate the proposed transaction, and both will cooperate to provide the information to the City. The City shall be under no obligation to transfer the Franchise if Grantee’s acts or omissions make the Franchise subject to revocation, or would permit the City to deny renewal. Nor shall the City be required to transfer unless it is satisfied that any interests it or the public has in the Franchise will be preserved and protected; that past nonperformance will be corrected; and that the proposed transferee has the financial, legal and technical ability and is likely to comply with the Franchise for the future. Under no circumstances will the Franchise be transferred unless the proposed transferee agrees to accept all the terms and conditions of the Franchise; agrees that the transfer does not constitute a waiver of any rights by the Franchisor or indicate that the prior Grantee is or has been in compliance with the Franchise; and agrees to assume all the obligations and liabilities of the prior Grantee. The City may conduct such public hearings as it deems appropriate to consider the transfer request. Approval of a transfer will not be unreasonably withheld. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


9.4 Other matters.

9.4.1 Change In Control – Defined. A “change in control,” for purposes of this section 9, includes a change in actual working control in whatever manner exercised and shall be deemed to have occurred whenever there is a disposition of ten percent or more of any interest in Grantee or any person that, through any arrangement, manages or controls the Grantee.

9.4.2 Evidence of Transfer. A Grantee, upon transfer, shall within sixty (60) days thereafter file with City a copy of the deed, agreement, mortgage, lease or other written instrument evidencing transfer or ownership control or lease of the System, certified and sworn to as correct by the Grantee.

9.4.3 Effect of Transfer Without Authorization. Any transfer made without the authorization required herein renders the Franchise null and void from the time of the transfer.


9.5 Certain transfers to affiliates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City recognizes that Grantee is directly owned by TCI Central, Inc. (TCI-Central) which in turn owns or controls directly a number of other cable companies. In order to facilitate reorganization of TCI-Central companies, as deemed appropriate, the City agrees that prior consent shall not be required for any transfer to any company owned or controlled or under common control and with the same direct parent as, i.e. TCI-Central, Inc., and which is intended after such transfer to remain under the ownership or control of TCI Holdings, Inc. or an entity under common control or with the same direct parent as TCI-Central, Inc., provided that, no such transfer shall be valid unless and until Grantee and transferee submit a binding agreement and warranty to the City stating that:

(a) The transferee has read, accepts and agrees to be bound by each and every term of the franchise and related amendments, regulations, ordinances and resolutions then in effect;

(b) The transferee assumes all liabilities and responsibility under the Franchise, and related amendments, regulations, ordinances and resolutions then lawfully in effect for the acts and omissions of Grantee known and unknown, and agrees that the transfer shall not permit it to take any position or exercise any right which could not have been exercised by Grantee; and (c) the transfer will not substantially increase the financial burdens upon or substantially diminish the financial resources available to the system operator, comparing the Grantee to the transferee in a manner which materially may affect the Topeka system.

Grantee and transferee shall also describe the nature of the transfer, and submit complete information regarding the effect of the transfer on the direct and indirect ownership and control of the system operator. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

Section 10. Miscellaneous


10.1 Time of essence, maintenance of records of essence.

In determining whether Grantee has substantially complied with Franchise, the parties agree that time is of essence to the agreement. As a result, Grantee’s failure to complete construction, extend service, seek approval of transfers or provide information in a timely manner may constitute substantial breaches. The maintenance of records and provision of reports in accordance with the Franchise is also of essence to the agreement. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


10.2 Effect of preemption – Federal and state law.

Grantee must comply with all applicable provisions of federal and state law, except to the extent those provisions are lawfully superseded by a provision of this Franchise. Without limiting the foregoing, if federal or state law establishes times for a Grantee’s actions that are different than the times established under Grantee’s Franchise, and if the federal or state law limits preempt the times established in Grantee’s Franchise, then for the period the Franchise times are preempted, the federal or state law times shall apply and in other respects the provisions of the Franchise shall not be affected. If the City’s ability to enforce any Franchise provision is finally and conclusively preempted, then the provision shall be deemed preempted but only to the extent and for the period the preemption is required by law. If, as a result of a change in law or otherwise, the provision would again be enforceable, it shall be enforceable and Grantee will comply with all obligations thereunder without the requirement of any action by City. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


10.3 Force majeure.

A Grantee shall not be deemed in default or noncompliance with provisions of its Franchise where performance was rendered impossible by war or riots, civil disturbance, hurricanes, floods or other natural catastrophes or similar events beyond Grantee’s control, and the Franchise shall not be revoked or a Grantee penalized for such noncompliance, provided the Grantee takes immediate and diligent steps to bring itself back into compliance and to comply as soon as possible under the circumstances with its Franchise without unduly endangering the health, safety and integrity of Grantee’s employees or property, or the health, safety and integrity of the public, or Public Streets, Public Property or private property. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


10.4 Written notice.

Notices the parties are required to provide to each other under this Agreement shall be sent by U.S. mail to the following, except that either party may change the person to whom and place to which its notices are to be sent by notifying the other party of the changes in writing:

10.5 Connections to a grantee’s system, use of antennas.

It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to make any unauthorized connection, whether physically, acoustically, inductively or otherwise, with any part of Grantee’s Cable System or facilities, for the purpose of enabling the reception of any television, radio, picture, program, sound, or data signals, or other services, without payment to and authorization from Grantee, except that subscribers shall have the right to attach devices to a Grantee’s system to allow them to transmit signals or services for which they have paid to VCR’s, television sets or other terminal devices; and subscribers shall have the right to use their own remote control devices and converters, and other similar equipment, and Grantee shall provide information to consumers which will allow them to adjust such devices so that they may be used with Grantee’s system. It shall also be unlawful for any person, without the consent of Grantee, to willfully tamper with, remove or injure any cables, wires or equipment of a Grantee used for the distribution of television, radio, picture, program, sound or data signals, or other services, unless a Grantee fails to remove such devices from the property of such person if the person chooses not to take service, or if Grantee places such devices on any property where it has no right to place such devices. Grantee shall not, as a condition to providing service, require a subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna, or disconnect an antenna except at the express direction of the subscriber or potential subscriber, or prohibit or discourage a subscriber from installing an antenna switch provided such equipment and installations are consistent with applicable codes. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


10.6 Kansas law governs.

Except as to matters which are governed solely by federal law, this Franchise will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


10.7 Determination of questions of fact.

The City attorney is hereby authorized to settle any dispute arising from Grantee’s operations under its Franchise except those to which the City is a party; any person dissatisfied with the decision of the City attorney may appeal the decision to the City Council. The City Council may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the City attorney, or may settle the dispute. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


10.8 Headings descriptive.

The headings set forth herein are descriptive only. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)


10.9 Attorneys fees.

If any legal action is instituted to enforce any of the terms of this Agreement, one party’s reasonable attorney’s fees and all costs of the court action, including court costs, expert witness fees and all other actual expense incurred in the prosecution or the defense of this action shall be paid by the other party, to the extent the party prevails. (Ord. 16560 § 1, 3-9-93.)

6.3 In addition to rights reserved by grantor, subscribers shall have rights with respect to alterations in service. The grantee may not alter the service being provided to a class of subscribers (including by re-tiering, restructuring or otherwise) without the express permission of each subscriber, unless it complies with this section. Prior to grantee altering the service it provides to a class of subscribers, grantee must provide each subscriber in that class at least 30 days notice; explain the substance and full effect of the alteration; and provide the subscriber the right within the 60-day period following notice, to opt to receive any combination of services offered by grantee. Grantee may not alter a service already paid for by subscriber, but must deliver that service. Subscribers who elect to receive a different service within the 60-day period may not be required to pay any charge (other than the regular service fee), including an upgrade or downgrade charge, in order to receive the services selected.

6.4 Grantee shall not levy a disconnect fee at any time, and may not levy a downgrade charge which exceeds the actual cost of the downgrade, except in cases of repeated and documented abuse of promotional offers or service guarantees.

6.5 No charge may be made for reconnection where a subscriber is improperly disconnected; and reconnection charges may not be higher than the standard installation charge being paid at the time of reconnection.

6.6 No charge may be made for any service or product which subscriber has not affirmatively indicated it wishes to receive, separate and apart from payment of the regular monthly bill.

EXHIBIT 2.

TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

Introduction

TCI of Kansas, Inc., (“Company”) is pleased to submit its informal proposal for the technical upgrade of the Topeka cable system. The following pages outline the Company’s proposal for the upgrade including the technical specifications and standards for the operation of the upgraded system, and a preliminary construction timetable for completion of the project.

TCI of Kansas, Inc. is committed to the long-term goal of maintaining excellence in service to its customers. The upgrade of the system plays an important part in accomplishing that goal in Topeka.

TCI of Kansas, Inc. proposes, upon the effective date of a renewed franchise agreement for a term of 15 years to commence an upgrade of the Topeka system to a 550 MHz, 80-plus channel capacity system, utilizing fiber optical technology in fiber-to-feeder architecture design. Upon completion of the upgrade, the Company proposes to initially activate 10 additional channels of programming on the system. The proposed system will provide integrated stereo sound where available and emergency alert capability.

We look forward to our continuing relationship with Topeka with confidence in our commitment to future excellence.

Technical Upgrade

TCI of Kansas, Inc. proposes, upon the signing of a 15-year franchise renewal document, to technically upgrade the Topeka, Kansas cable system incorporating optical fiber technology. Our proposal for the Topeka cable system is a “fiber-to-the-feeder” design. The optical fiber technology is one of the newer tools which the cable industry employs to enhance system capability and reliability, and to increase channel capacity. Upon completion of the upgrade the cable system will be built to a 550 MHz bandwidth capable of providing in excess of 80 channels. It is estimated that this upgrade will be completed within 36 months of the effective date of the franchise renewal agreement. The upgraded system will also provide two-way interactive links serving all three current outside origination points (City Hall, Washburn University and USD 501). Additionally, we propose dark fiber links between three additional locations, Topeka High School, Highland Park High School and Topeka West High School would be ideal sites for interactive hubs. All interactive sites would connect back to a single centralized point such as the system headend or an access center.

Fiber Optic Construction

Optical fiber technology uses very thin strands of glass to carry light signals generated by laser transmitters or other light sources. Information can be carried by light in much the same way as information is carried by electronic signals over the copper “twisted pair” wire used by telephone systems for voice and data, and over the coaxial cable used by cable systems for transmitting video and data. Fiber has wider bandwidth or carrying capacity than traditional copper twisted pair wire, although fiber, in its current applications, does not have more usable bandwidth than coaxial cable.

The primary advantage of fiber over coaxial cable is that a signal can be carried greater distances with lower loss of power and subsequent need for amplification. Amplifiers are needed to strengthen cable signals where long stretches of coaxial cable exist. Long stretches of cable requiring “cascades” of amplifiers can result in poor signal quality, or a loss in the number of channels that can be delivered. Fiber has a greater ability to carry signals without losing power, and thus fiber allows systems to reduce the number of amplifiers between the headend and the customer, or to eliminate amplifiers in longer “supertrunk” lines. The elimination of amplifiers results in improved quality and reliability.

Other advantages from the cable industry’s installation of optical fiber include:

Cost Effective Upgrades of Channel Capacity. The existing coaxial cable to every home is theoretically capable of carrying 100 – 200 channels. Reducing the number of amplifiers on a cascade between headend and customer through the use of fiber allows significant channel upgrades without expensive replacement of the cable to each individual home, or local loop.

Improved Reliability. Because there are fewer amplifiers in a typical cascade to fail in a fiber-enhanced system, there are fewer customers affected by any given individual amplifier failure.

Improved Signal Quality. Because of the reduced number of amplifiers between the headend and customer, transmissions along fiber optic cable degrade far less quickly and result in stronger, clearer picture at the receiving end.

Cable Industry Use of Fiber – Point-to-Point Communications.

Fiber technology is being employed by the cable industry to improve communications that require high capacity connections between two locations, known as point-to-point communications, for example, linking separate headends together. This application is sometime referred to as “supertrunking.” Other point-to-point fiber applications in use by the industry include linking remote production studios (for example, facilities which record local government meetings for the government access channel) with the headend, or connecting the headend with a satellite dish or antenna which for some reason must be located away from the headend.

Cable Industry Use of Fiber – Evolutionary Applications.

The more evolutionary application of fiber is currently known by a number of names, such as “fiber backbone” and “Cable Area Network.” In such application a fiber link is constructed between the system headend and a point somewhere in the distribution network. Evolutionary applications bring fiber closer to the customer, which means that the signal that reaches the customer has not been degraded by as many amplifiers and other electronics. The highly flexible system that results from evolutionary fiber deployment allows cable systems to deliver more channels, to improve system reliability, and to reduce operating costs.

“Fiber backbone” or “Cable Area Network” applications are considered evolutionary because placing fiber in this portion of the network not only makes technical and economic sense today, but also sets the stage for further developments in fiber and other cable technologies which will lead to significant channel capacity expansion and the introduction of innovative program services.

Another new application of fiber is called “fiber-to-the-feeder” (“FTF”). The 550 MegaHertz (MHz) FTF design takes fiber all the way to the feeder plant, which is the last stage before the actual connection to the home. The 550 MHz FTF design is the latest in a series of logical, cost-effective steps which the cable industry has taken to deploy the useful technology of optical fiber.

Growth in Cable’s Use of Fiber.

The 20 largest multiple system operators (MSO’s) have begun installation of fiber within their systems. The amount of fiber installed by these companies has increased by 400 percent since 1988, with over 13 million subscribers now served by systems utilizing fiber optics. Current estimates indicate that cable industry deployment of fiber is expected to grow at an annual rate of 25 percent over the next decade.

Cable Systems of the Future.

Programming/bandwidth expansion, fiber optics, high definition television (HDTV), compressed digital video, interactivity, telephony and personal communications networks (PCN) are among the advances for which cable operators must plan in plant construction today.

The cable industry’s research and development consortium, Cable Labs, currently envisions future cable systems to be hybrid fiber/coax systems. This design melds the evolutionary fiber thinking applications, as they are being implemented today, with coaxial cable used to connect to the home.

The resulting hybrid looks like a star architecture, but it has none of the cost-burdens of the switched-star system used by tide telephone industry. Further, it has construction economies similar to a tree-and-branch system, but none of the growth barriers.

Cable industry use of fiber optics provides all excellent platform for future evolutionary growth. Specific future-ready provisions include the following:

Bandwidth Expandable. All cable and feeder electronics housings and chassis are qualified for full channel loading at 550 MHz or more. Future bandwidth expansion is expected to be further eased by new hybrid AM/digital transmission schemes (see Compressed Digital Video section below). Lasers, photodiode detectors and optical transmission fiber all facilitate relatively easy expansion toward 1,000 MHz bandwidths.

Advanced Amplifiers. Line extenders use cost-efficient power-doubled or QUADRAPOWER technology. These advanced amplifiers further facilitate bandwidth expansion and future channel additions.

Optical Splitters. Today’s system optical splitters are located in the headends, rather than in the field. This allows all option of more easily converting the optical network in the future. Future field-splitting and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) expansion options are available for additional expansion.

Optical Amplifiers. Based on laboratory performance of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers operating at 1550 nm, fiber optic node location decisions incorporate projected future plant upgrades. Using narrow linewidth light sources, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that 1550 nm transmission over standard 1310 nm fiber can be accomplished with no dispersion-related increase in noise or distortion. Other experiments have shown high optical amplifier outputs of with no measurable contribution to system distortion and manageable noise figures. Dual-window (1310/1550nm) fiber and optical passives are used in current construction.

High Definition Television. FTF systems provide the bandwidth expansion and system flexibility required to handle an HDTV transmission system currently envisioned. Cable television’s growth plan assumes that HDTV technology will prove in first for premium services and that all digital HDTV transmission will become the norm. Therefore, provisions for HDTV are similar to those for Compressed Digital Video, below.

Compressed Digital Video. The cable industry is ready for expected AM/Digital video hybrid transmission schemes. Based on a David Grugg III analysis published in the NCTA ‘91 Technical Papers, a 4 to 6 dB distortion improvement factor is projected for AM/Digital systems compared to all analog channel loading systems. The use of digital carriers above 550 MHz also will ease high frequency tap level requirements because the digital signals can tolerate more noise.

Cable will not only increase its reach in the future, but the capabilities of the cable infrastructure will be dramatically improved. Industry plans call for spending $18 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade plant and equipment.

Optical fiber will be an integral part of this upgrading, and by 1999 will account for almost forty percent of the total annual investment in trunk and feeder cable. Fiber is viewed not as an end in itself, but as a complement to already sophisticated cable systems which will improve system performance and will enable operators to deliver a wider variety of programming and services. Our proposal for Topeka is the “fiber-to-the-feeder” design. Through continued development and application of fiber optics and other innovative technologies, the cable industry is guaranteed to be at the forefront of communications technology, offering the video network of the future today.

Service Area.

The upgraded cable system will be accomplished in a manner that continues to serve all areas currently served and so that newly annexed or currently unserved areas can be served in accordance with the criteria stated below.

New or Unserviced Areas.

For areas annexed after March 1, 1992, Grantee will extend service to businesses and residences requesting service at no charge to the subscriber beyond normal installation charges where such business or residence is within 150 feet of existing cable plant, or where residential density meets or exceeds 15 homes per quarter mile measured from existing cable plant. Where a subscriber requesting service does not meet the above criteria, the Grantee will extend service to such subscriber on a cost sharing basis according to the following formula:

	Total Cost Per Quarter Mile	= 	Grantee’s Share

	15

	Total Cost less Grantee’s Share	=	Subscriber’s Share

	Number of Requesting Subscribers

Initial Programming.

We at TCI of Kansas, Inc. are committed to providing our customers with a comprehensive and well-balanced mix or programming. This mix should be reliable and proven, both in terms of subscriber popularity and long-term success. Following franchise renewal, a wide variety of services will include, at a minimum, television broadcast signals and an array of satellite-delivered cable programming. The Company recognizes that its programming fare should be in harmony with the needs and interests of the community, ensuring customer satisfaction and commercial viability. The Company feels it must cave ultimate flexibility in its programming decisions so it can respond to market conditions and customer demand. It reserves that right to make changes from time to time should, for instance, a service become unavailable, or should programming become available that better responds to the needs and interests of customers.

At completion of the system upgrade project, we propose an initial activation of 10 additional channels in addition to those currently being carried. Two of the 10 would be set aside for additional PEG use. The new and extremely popular low priced premium service Encore would be added. A regional sports network such as Prime Sports Network would be a positive addition to the expanded basic package. Two channels would be dedicated to pay per view with the remaining slots being added to the basic service. The service line-up would then consist of 46 activated channels, a 32 channel basic service including four channels dedicated to PEG, a seven channel expanded basic service, five premium channels and two pay per view channels.

Emergency Alert Capability.

The Company has installed a device in the headend that can override the audio portion of each cable channel and substitute an audio emergency message. With this system in place, fire, flood, severe weather warnings, and civil defense alerts can be cable cast over the system to the entire Topeka cable community by authorized community officials.

The Civil Emergency Alert System is installed in the headend where it is backed up by the stand-by power facility. It is remotely activated by using either a dedicated line, a touch-tone telephone or a radio control link. Once the proper code is introduced into the system, the telephone can be used to deliver the emergency message.

The Company requests that the City of Topeka hold TCI of Kansas, Inc., its agents, employees, officers, and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the City’s emergency use of its facilities. The Company will work with the City to incorporate the emergency alert notification into the Community’s disaster plan.

High Definition Television/Advanced Television.

Enhancing the picture quality for our customers is an on-going objective of TCI of Kansas, Inc. and its ultimate parent, Tele-Communications, Inc.

High Definition Television (HDTV) is one technology that potentially offers viewers a more “life-like” picture by providing sharper colors and contrasts, and an enhanced perspective of real depth. The Company has invested a significant amount of money and energy in researching and developing HDTV so that it is prepared for the advent of this exciting advance in picture quality.

Currently, however, no national standards or policies for HDTV have been established by the National Television Standards Committee. This must occur first because not only will this technology affect cable operators, it will have a dramatic impact on the broadcast and equipment manufacturing industries. In addition, most present-day television sets in consumer households are not able to receive or retransmit this type of quality. Another technology that can provide HDTV-like picture quality is called Advanced Television. With this technology, which may be available in the nearer term, customers will be able to receive an enhanced video signal by using their existing televisions sets.

Offering our customers a new and enhanced visual experience through one of these new technologies represents a long-term commitment by the Company.

Pay Per View.

The upgraded system will maintain and enhance our current pay per view capability with channel space dedicated to pay per view use.

Stereo.

The system upgrade will include the additional headend equipment necessary to provide integrated stereo sound on those channels and programs that are originated and available to the Company in stereo.

Technical Specifications and Standards

The technical specifications and construction procedures which the Company strive to maintain throughout the Topeka system are detailed below.

Construction Standards.

Materials and components used will be of the highest quality and of Technical conservative design. For example, distribution or feeder lines shall be constructed using low-loss aluminum coaxial cable.

To ensure reliability and continuing good service, system components will be carefully selected to maintain system RF shielding integrity. All splices and connectors will be of the integral sleeve type. House-drop cable will be double-shielded, with a layer of foil and 67 percent braid coverage.

To minimize the occurrence of major system outages and other problems, the Company will take the following precautions:

• All indoor headend components will be in an air-conditioned environment to insure optimum functioning.

• The system will be bonded and grounded.

• All towers, antennas, satellite receive stations, and other exposed equipment will be properly grounded.

Standard construction practices to be followed by TCI of Kansas, Inc. dictate that coaxial cable splices shall be held to a minimum, be properly waterproofed, and contain adequate thermal expansion loops to absorb the expansion and contraction of the cable due to temperature variation.

Reliability of Service.

The Company considers reliability of service second only to safety in the design and construction of a cable system. With respect to the latter, construction practices shall be accordance with standard utility pole regulations, and the statutes and regulations, currently in effect, listed below:

• Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications Commissions. Parts 76 and 78,

• Obstruction Marking and Lighting, AC 70/7460-IE, Federal Aviation Administration,

• Federal Communications Commission Rules, Part 17, Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structure,

• National Electrical Safety Code,

• OSHA Safety and Health Standards,

• NCTA Standards of Good Engineering Practices, NCTA 008-0477 E1A Standard RS-222C, “Structural Standards for Steel Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures.”

System Maintenance and Performance Tests.

The system performance tests that are performed on a monthly basis include Frequency Response, Signal-to-Noise, Signal-to-Hum, Headend Operations, and Satellite station Inspection. The entire plant will be inspected for egress on a quarterly basis. Yearly system performance tests are performed in compliance with guidelines set forth by the FCC.

Preventive maintenance will consist of a monthly routine evaluation of all system operating parameters.

Microwave System Maintenance.

The microwave system used to import Kansas City area off-air signals will be maintained in accordance with manufacturer’s recommended standards and applicable FCC specifications. All maintenance and repair will be performed by licensed technicians.

Conclusion

This technical proposal by TCI of Kansas, Inc. is based on information conveyed by the City and our customers. It is also based on the Company’s firsthand knowledge of the community it serves. The Company feels that the cable system proposed in this document is responsive to the cable-related community needs of Topeka. The community will inevitably undergo many changes in the future that create new needs. The Company will continue to remain aware of changes that are taking place within the City and will make reasonable attempts to respond to these changes in order to provide services that enhance life for all residents.

The Company may not allow a subsidiary, affiliate, or a third (3rd) party to acquire rights to occupy the Rights-of-Way under this Franchise; provided, that nothing in this section shall prevent Company from allowing the use of its Facilities by others when such use is compensated to the City under the provisions of a franchise granted by the City to any such third party.

c. Upon written request of either the City or the Company, the Franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time upon any of the following events:

1. Change in federal, state, or local law, regulation, or order which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or the Company, including but not limited to the scope of the grant to the Company or the compensation to be received by the City; or

2. Change in the structure or operation of the electrical energy industry which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or the Company, including but not limited to the scope of the grant to the Company or the compensation to be received by the City; or

3. Any other material and unintended change or shift in the economic benefit to the City or a change the Company did not anticipate upon accepting the grant of this Franchise.

Section 4. Compensation to the City.

In consideration of and as compensation for the Franchise hereby granted to the Company by the City, the Company shall make an accounting to the City of all electric energy that has been distributed on a monthly basis. The Company shall pay the City:

A sum equal to five percent (5%) of the Gross Receipts received from the Distribution of electric energy; and

The above sum shall be adjusted for uncollectible receivables and for uncollectible receivables which are later collected.

Payment of compensation above shall be effective on the first day of the first month after final passage and approval by the City and acceptance by the Company. Prior to that date, payments shall continue to be calculated and be paid in the manner previously provided in Ordinance 16602. Such payments shall be made to the City under procedures, which are mutually agreed to by the Company and the City within thirty (30) days of the last day of the month to which such accounting shall apply.

In the event the accounting rendered to the City by the Company is found to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount, it being agreed that the City may accept any amount offered by the Company, but the acceptance thereof by the City shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or later found to be incorrect. The Company agrees that all of its books, records, documents, contracts and agreements as may be reasonably necessary for an effective compliance review of this Franchise shall at all reasonable times be opened to the inspection and examination of the officers of the City and its duly authorized agents, auditor, and employees for the purpose of verifying said accounting. Notwithstanding the obligation herein, the Company shall have the right to request the reasonable protection of proprietary information of the Company.

For each and every month, or any part thereof, that the compensation provided for by this Franchise remains unpaid after the same becomes due and payable by the City, there shall be added to such payment, as a late charge, a sum equivalent to the statutory rate for interest on the unpaid amount. Such late charge shall be applicable to sums that are delinquent as well as any sums due the City as the result of an audit of the Company’s records. (Ord. 19067 § 4, 4-8-08.)


Section 5. Payment and charges.

The payments and compensation herein provided shall be in lieu of all other licenses, taxes, charges, and fees, except that the usual general property taxes and special ad valorem property assessments, sales and excise taxes, or charges made for privileges which are not connected with the electric energy business, will be imposed on the Company and are not covered by the payments herein. (Ord. 19067 § 5, 4-8-08.)


Section 6. Use of Right-of-Way.

The use of the Right-of-Way under this Franchise by the Company shall be subject to all rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to use, placement, location, or management of utilities located in the City’s Right-of-Way. In addition, the Company shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Company to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Company shall comply with the following:

a. The Company’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Company shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Company in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Company without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Company, the Company shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception all work, including emergency work performed in the Right-of-Way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Company shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Company shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Company, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Company, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Company is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Company shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way, City’s easements, or platted utility easements which contain City utilities or facilities if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Company without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Company, the Company shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Company for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Company directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Company shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way, City’s easements, or platted utility easements which contain City utilities or facilities at the Company’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Company for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Company’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way, City’s easements, or platted utility easements which contain City utilities or facilities if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Company shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Franchise. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Company. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Company shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Company may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Franchise.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Company’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Company has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Company to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Company fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Company shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Company to perform any of its obligations under this Franchise. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Company’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Company will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Company. (Ord. 19067 § 6, 4-8-08.)


Section 7. Indemnity and hold harmless.

The Company shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Company’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Company, then upon notice by the City to the Company, the Company shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Company, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 19067 § 7, 4-8-08.)


Section 8. Right of assignment.

Section 9. Forfeiture.

Any material and substantial fraud, misrepresentation or default of the terms, duties and obligations imposed upon AMR by the laws of the State of Kansas, Chapter 5.25 TMC or by this Franchise Ordinance shall constitute grounds for forfeiture of this nonexclusive Franchise Ordinance.

In the event this Franchise Ordinance is forfeited, AMR shall, within one hundred eighty (180) days of its receipt of notice of forfeiture, cease operation of an ambulance service hereunder.

Fair rate of return means receipt of revenues for patient charges and public funds, if any, to include the sum of operating costs, depreciation reserves, growth and development costs and management fees.

Further, Brooks Fiber shall comply with the following:

c. The Company shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the City.

The Company shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of Brooks Fiber. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, Brooks Fiber shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for Brooks Fiber’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that Brooks Fiber has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of Brooks Fiber to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage.

The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near Brooks Fiber’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and Department of Transportation, City of Topeka Standard Technical Specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities.

For the fifteenth (15th) day of each month during said twelve (12) month period, the Settlement Prices for the next twelve (12) months will be summed and divided by twelve (12) to determine an average Settlement Price. The average Settlement Prices for each of the twelve (12) months shall then be summed and divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by five percent (5%) to obtain the Volumetric Rate to be effective January 1 of the next succeeding year. The Volumetric Rate shall be calculated in July annually by the City and shall be effective upon filing of the completed Volumetric Rate Calculation Form with the City Clerk without requirement of amendment to this Ordinance.

The Provider shall pay the City a franchise fee that is calculated in a manner provided in each franchise that is substantially equivalent to the fees paid by Providers of natural gas, taking into account the alternative form of energy, its value per unit, and the amount of energy necessary for light, heat, power, or other purposes.

Sec. 5. Adjustment of volumetric rate.

The Volumetric Rate shall be recalculated annually by the City beginning January 1, 2005, based upon the Settlement Prices. The Volumetric Rate calculation form on file with the City Clerk and incorporated herein by reference shall be used for the recalculation of the Volumetric Rate. The recalculation shall be effective each January 1 and shall be based on Settlement Prices for the twelve (12) month period beginning in July of the second (2nd) preceding year and ending in June of the preceding year. For the fifteenth (15th) day of each month during said twelve (12) month period, the Settlement Prices for the next twelve (12) months will be summed and divided by twelve (12) to determine an average Settlement Price. The average Settlement Prices for each of the twelve (12) months shall then be summed and divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by five percent (5%) to obtain the Volumetric Rate to be effective January 1 of the next succeeding year. The Volumetric Rate shall be calculated in July annually by the City and shall be effective upon filing of the completed Volumetric Rate Calculation Form with the City Clerk without requirement of amendment to this Ordinance. (Ord. 18296 § 5, 7-20-04.)

Such location removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Company without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Company, the Company shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City.

The Company may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance.

h. The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Company’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Company has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

i. It shall be the responsibility of the Company to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Company fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Company shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Company to perform any of its obligations under this Ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Company’s Facilities.

j. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission, U.S. Department of Transportation, and City’s standard technical specifications unless inconsistent with state or federal laws. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

k. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Company will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Company.

Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended.

(Ord. 18823 § 3, 3-6-07.)

The use of the Right-of-Way under this Franchise by the Local Provider shall be subject to all rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to use, placement, location, or management of utilities located in the City’s Right-of-Way. In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18823 § 5, 3-6-07.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 18823 § 6, 3-6-07.)

Section 1. [Generally.]

Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, a Contract Franchise Ordinance is hereby granted to YourTel America, Inc., a telecommunications local exchange service provider providing local exchange service hereinafter referred to as “Local Provider” within the City of Topeka, Kansas (“City”), subject to the provisions contained hereafter. The initial term of this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be for a period of two (2) years beginning March 1, 2007, and ending February 28, 2009. Thereafter, this Contract Franchise Ordinance will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract Franchise Ordinance at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract Franchise Ordinance and not as a new Contract Franchise Ordinance or amendment. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(b)(2), as amended, under no circumstances shall this Contract Franchise Ordinance exceed twenty (20) years from the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance. Compensation for said Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be established pursuant to Section 3 of this ordinance. (Ord. 18824 § 1, 3-6-07.)


Section 2. [Definitions.]

For the purpose of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, the following words and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meaning:

“Gross receipts” means only those receipts collected from within the corporate boundaries of the city enacting the franchise and which are derived from the following: (A) Recurring local exchange service for business and residence which includes basic exchange service, touch tone, optional calling features and measured local calls; (B) recurring local exchange access line services for pay phone lines provided by a telecommunications local exchange service provider to all pay phone service providers; (C) local directory assistance revenue; (D) line status verification/busy interrupt revenue; (E) local operator assistance revenue; and (F) nonrecurring local exchange service revenue which shall include customer service for installation of lines, reconnection of service and charge for duplicate bills. All other revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from extended area service, the sale or lease of unbundled network elements, nonregulated services, carrier and end user access, long distance, wireless telecommunications services, lines providing only data service without voice services processed by a telecommunications local exchange service provider, private line service arrangements, Internet, broadband and all other services not wholly local in nature are excluded from gross receipts. Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term “local exchange service” shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications local exchange service provider” means a local exchange carrier as defined in subsection (h) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, and a telecommunications carrier as defined in subsection (m) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, which does, or in good faith intends to, provide local exchange service. The term “telecommunications local exchange service provider” does not include an interexchange carrier that does not provide local exchange service, competitive access provider that does not provide local exchange service or any wireless telecommunications local exchange service provider.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 18824 § 2, 3-6-07.)


Section 3. Compensation.

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract which is contemplated by the parties to be on or after the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from changing the method of compensation from gross receipts to an access line fee pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, through amendment to the Contract Franchise Ordinance or establishment of a new Contract Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 18824 § 3, 3-6-07.)

The use of the Right-of-Way under this Franchise by the Local Provider shall be subject to all rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to use, placement, location, or management of utilities located in the City’s Right-of-Way. In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18824 § 5, 3-6-07.)


Section 6. Indemnity and hold harmless.

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend.

Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, a Contract Franchise Ordinance is hereby granted to Universal Telecom, Inc., a telecommunications local exchange service provider providing local exchange service hereinafter referred to as “Local Provider” within the City of Topeka, Kansas (“City”), subject to the provisions contained hereafter. The initial term of this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be for a period of two (2) years beginning March 1, 2007, and ending February 28, 2009. Thereafter, this Contract Franchise Ordinance will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract Franchise Ordinance at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract Franchise Ordinance and not as a new Contract Franchise Ordinance or amendment. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(b)(2), as amended, under no circumstances shall this Contract Franchise Ordinance exceed twenty (20) years from the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance. Compensation for said Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be established pursuant to Section 3 of this ordinance. (Ord. 18854 § 1, 4-24-07.)


Section 2. Definitions.

For the purpose of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, the following words and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meaning:

“Gross receipts” means only those receipts collected from within the corporate boundaries of the city enacting the franchise and which are derived from the following: (A) Recurring local exchange service for business and residence which includes basic exchange service, touch tone, optional calling features and measured local calls; (B) recurring local exchange access line services for pay phone lines provided by a telecommunications local exchange service provider to all pay phone service providers; (C) local directory assistance revenue; (D) line status verification/busy interrupt revenue; (E) local operator assistance revenue; and (F) nonrecurring local exchange service revenue which shall include customer service for installation of lines, reconnection of service and charge for duplicate bills. All other revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from extended area service, the sale or lease of unbundled network elements, nonregulated services, carrier and end user access, long distance, wireless telecommunications services, lines providing only data service without voice services processed by a telecommunications local exchange service provider, private line service arrangements, Internet, broadband and all other services not wholly local in nature are excluded from gross receipts. Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term “local exchange service” shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications local exchange service provider” means a local exchange carrier as defined in subsection (h) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, and a telecommunications carrier as defined in subsection (m) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, which does, or in good faith intends to, provide local exchange service. The term “telecommunications local exchange service provider” does not include an interexchange carrier that does not provide local exchange service, competitive access provider that does not provide local exchange service or any wireless telecommunications local exchange service provider.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 18854 § 2, 4-24-07.)


Section 3. [Compensation.]

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract which is contemplated by the parties to be on or after the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from changing the method of compensation from gross receipts to an access line fee pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, through amendment to the Contract Franchise Ordinance or establishment of a new Contract Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 18854 § 3, 4-24-07.)

Section 5. [City’s Right-of-Way.]

The use of the Right-of-Way under this Franchise by the Local Provider shall be subject to all rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to use, placement, location, or management of utilities located in the City’s Right-of-Way. In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18854 § 5, 4-24-07.)


Section 6. Indemnity and hold harmless.

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 18854 § 6, 4-24-07.)


Section 7. [Requirements.]

As a condition of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, Local Provider is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC), subject to Local Provider’s right to challenge in good faith such requirements as established by the FCC, KCC or other City Ordinance. Local Provider shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or ordinances, subject to Local Provider’s right to challenge in good faith such laws, statutes and/or ordinances. (Ord. 18854 § 7, 4-24-07.)

Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information.

The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18867 § 5, 5-8-07.)

In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 18867 § 6, 5-8-07.)


Section 7. Requirements.

The City agrees to provide Local Provider with notification in the event that it annexes property into the corporate boundaries of the City that would require Local Provider to collect and pay a franchise fee on access lines or gross receipts which prior to the annexation of the property Local Provider was not required to pay a franchise fee. The City agrees to provide Local Provider with notification in the event the City renumbers or renames any streets that would require Local Provider to collect and pay a franchise fee on access lines or gross receipts which prior to the renumbering or renaming of the streets Local Provider would not have been required to pay a franchise fee.

Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, a Contract Franchise Ordinance is hereby granted to Birch Telecom of Kansas, Inc., a telecommunications local exchange service provider providing local exchange service hereinafter referred to as “Local Provider” within the City of Topeka, Kansas (“City”), subject to the provisions contained hereafter. The initial term of this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be for a period of two (2) years beginning July 1, 2007, and ending June 30, 2009. Thereafter, this Contract Franchise Ordinance will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract Franchise Ordinance at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract Franchise Ordinance and not as a new Contract Franchise Ordinance or amendment. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(b)(2), as amended, under no circumstances shall this Contract Franchise Ordinance exceed twenty (20) years from the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance. Compensation for said Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be established pursuant to Section 3 of this ordinance. (Ord. 18893 § 1, 6-12-07.)


Section 2. [Definitions.]

For the purpose of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, the following words and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meaning:

“Gross receipts” means only those receipts collected from within the corporate boundaries of the city enacting the franchise and which are derived from the following: (A) Recurring local exchange service for business and residence which includes basic exchange service, touch tone, optional calling features and measured local calls; (B) recurring local exchange access line services for pay phone lines provided by a telecommunications local exchange service provider to all pay phone service providers; (C) local directory assistance revenue; (D) line status verification/busy interrupt revenue; (E) local operator assistance revenue; and (F) nonrecurring local exchange service revenue which shall include customer service for installation of lines, reconnection of service and charge for duplicate bills. All other revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from extended area service, the sale or lease of unbundled network elements, nonregulated services, carrier and end user access, long distance, wireless telecommunications services, lines providing only data service without voice services processed by a telecommunications local exchange service provider, private line service arrangements, Internet, broadband and all other services not wholly local in nature are excluded from gross receipts. Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term “local exchange service” shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications local exchange service provider” means a local exchange carrier as defined in subsection (h) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, and a telecommunications carrier as defined in subsection (m) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, which does, or in good faith intends to, provide local exchange service. The term “telecommunications local exchange service provider” does not include an interexchange carrier that does not provide local exchange service, competitive access provider that does not provide local exchange service or any wireless telecommunications local exchange service provider.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 18893 § 2, 6-12-07.)


Section 3. [Compensation.]

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract and the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from changing the method of compensation from gross receipts to an access line fee pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, through amendment to the Contract Franchise Ordinance or establishment of a new Contract Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 18893 § 3, 6-12-07.)

In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose.

The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18893 § 5, 6-12-07.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 18893 § 6, 6-12-07.)

Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18894 § 5, 6-12-07.)

In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend.

Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, a Contract Franchise Ordinance is hereby granted to Navigator Telecommunications, L.L.C., a telecommunications local exchange service provider providing local exchange service hereinafter referred to as “Local Provider” within the City of Topeka, Kansas (“City”), subject to the provisions contained hereafter. The initial term of this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be for a period of two (2) years beginning August 1, 2007, and ending July 31, 2009. Thereafter, this Contract Franchise Ordinance will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract Franchise Ordinance at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract Franchise Ordinance and not as a new Contract Franchise Ordinance or amendment. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(b)(2), as amended, under no circumstances shall this Contract Franchise Ordinance exceed twenty (20) years from the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance. Compensation for said Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be established pursuant to Section 3 of this ordinance. (Ord. 18911 § 1, 6-26-07.)


Section 2. [Definitions.]

For the purpose of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, the following words and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meaning:

“Gross receipts” means only those receipts collected from within the corporate boundaries of the city enacting the franchise and which are derived from the following: (A) Recurring local exchange service for business and residence which includes basic exchange service, touch tone, optional calling features and measured local calls; (B) recurring local exchange access line services for pay phone lines provided by a telecommunications local exchange service provider to all pay phone service providers; (C) local directory assistance revenue; (D) line status verification/busy interrupt revenue; (E) local operator assistance revenue; and (F) nonrecurring local exchange service revenue which shall include customer service for installation of lines, reconnection of service and charge for duplicate bills. All other revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from extended area service, the sale or lease of unbundled network elements, nonregulated services, carrier and end user access, long distance, wireless telecommunications services, lines providing only data service without voice services processed by a telecommunications local exchange service provider, private line service arrangements, Internet, broadband and all other services not wholly local in nature are excluded from gross receipts. Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term “local exchange service” shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications local exchange service provider” means a local exchange carrier as defined in subsection (h) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, and a telecommunications carrier as defined in subsection (m) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, which does, or in good faith intends to, provide local exchange service. The term “telecommunications local exchange service provider” does not include an interexchange carrier that does not provide local exchange service, competitive access provider that does not provide local exchange service or any wireless telecommunications local exchange service provider.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 18911 § 2, 6-26-07.)


Section 3. [Compensation.]

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract which is contemplated by the parties to be on or after the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from changing the method of compensation from gross receipts to an access line fee pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, through amendment to the Contract Franchise Ordinance or establishment of a new Contract Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 18911 § 3, 6-26-07.)

Section 5. [City’s Right-of-Way.]

The use of the Right-of-Way under this Franchise by the Local Provider shall be subject to all rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to use, placement, location, or management of utilities located in the City’s Right-of-Way. In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18911 § 5, 6-26-07.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 18911 § 6, 6-26-07.)


Section 7. [Requirements.]

As a condition of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, Local Provider is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC), subject to Local Provider’s right to challenge in good faith such requirements as established by the FCC, KCC or other City Ordinance. Local Provider shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or ordinances, subject to Local Provider’s right to challenge in good faith such laws, statutes and/or ordinances. (Ord. 18911 § 7, 6-26-07.)

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider.

In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend.

Section 1. [Generally.]

Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, a Contract Franchise Ordinance is hereby granted to Global Crossing Telemangement, Inc., a telecommunications local exchange service provider providing local exchange service hereinafter referred to as “Local Provider” within the City of Topeka, Kansas (“City”), subject to the provisions contained hereafter. The initial term of this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be for a period of two (2) years beginning September 1, 2007, and ending August 31, 2009. Thereafter, this Contract Franchise Ordinance will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract Franchise Ordinance at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract Franchise Ordinance and not as a new Contract Franchise Ordinance or amendment. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(b)(2), as amended, under no circumstances shall this Contract Franchise Ordinance exceed twenty (20) years from the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance. Compensation for said Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be established pursuant to Section 3 of this ordinance. (Ord. 18946 § 1, 8-14-07.)


Section 2. [Definitions.]

For the purpose of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, the following words and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meaning:

“Gross receipts” means only those receipts collected from within the corporate boundaries of the city enacting the franchise and which are derived from the following: (A) Recurring local exchange service for business and residence which includes basic exchange service, touch tone, optional calling features and measured local calls; (B) recurring local exchange access line services for pay phone lines provided by a telecommunications local exchange service provider to all pay phone service providers; (C) local directory assistance revenue; (D) line status verification/busy interrupt revenue; (E) local operator assistance revenue; and (F) nonrecurring local exchange service revenue which shall include customer service for installation of lines, reconnection of service and charge for duplicate bills. All other revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from extended area service, the sale or lease of unbundled network elements, nonregulated services, carrier and end user access, long distance, wireless telecommunications services, lines providing only data service without voice services processed by a telecommunications local exchange service provider, private line service arrangements, Internet, broadband and all other services not wholly local in nature are excluded from gross receipts. Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term “local exchange service” shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications local exchange service provider” means a local exchange carrier as defined in subsection (h) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, and a telecommunications carrier as defined in subsection (m) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, which does, or in good faith intends to, provide local exchange service. The term “telecommunications local exchange service provider” does not include an interexchange carrier that does not provide local exchange service, competitive access provider that does not provide local exchange service or any wireless telecommunications local exchange service provider.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 18946 § 2, 8-14-07.)


Section 3. [Compensation.]

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract which is contemplated by the parties to be on or after the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from changing the method of compensation from gross receipts to an access line fee pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, through amendment to the Contract Franchise Ordinance or establishment of a new Contract Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 18946 § 3, 8-14-07.)

In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project.

At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City.

The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18946 § 5, 8-14-07.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(b)(2), as amended, under no circumstances shall this Contract Franchise Ordinance exceed twenty (20) years from the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance. Compensation for said Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be established pursuant to Section 3 of this ordinance. (Ord. 19077 § 1, 4-22-08.)

For the purpose of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, the following words and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meaning:

“Gross receipts” means only those receipts collected from within the corporate boundaries of the city enacting the franchise and which are derived from the following: (A) Recurring local exchange service for business and residence which includes basic exchange service, touch tone, optional calling features and measured local calls; (B) recurring local exchange access line services for pay phone lines provided by a telecommunications local exchange service provider to all pay phone service providers; (C) local directory assistance revenue; (D) line status verification/busy interrupt revenue; (E) local operator assistance revenue; and (F) nonrecurring local exchange service revenue which shall include customer service for installation of lines, reconnection of service and charge for duplicate bills.

Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term “local exchange service” shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications local exchange service provider” means a local exchange carrier as defined in subsection (h) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, and a telecommunications carrier as defined in subsection (m) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, which does, or in good faith intends to, provide local exchange service. The term “telecommunications local exchange service provider” does not include an interexchange carrier that does not provide local exchange service, competitive access provider that does not provide local exchange service or any wireless telecommunications local exchange service provider.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 19077 § 2, 4-22-08.)


Section 3. [Compensation.]

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract which is contemplated by the parties to be on or after the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from changing the method of compensation from gross receipts to an access line fee pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, through amendment to the Contract Franchise Ordinance or establishment of a new Contract Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 19077 § 3, 4-22-08.)

Section 5. [City’s Right-of-Way.]

The use of the Right-of-Way under this Franchise by the Local Provider shall be subject to all rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to use, placement, location, or management of utilities located in the City’s Right-of-Way. In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 19077 § 5, 4-22-08.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 19077 § 6, 4-22-08.)

Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information.

The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 18947 § 5, 8-14-07.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend.

Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term “local exchange service” shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 19185 § 2, 11-25-08.)


Section 3. [Compensation.]

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract which is contemplated by the parties to be on or after the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts.

Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended.

In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this Ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 19185 § 5, 11-25-08.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 19185 § 6, 11-25-08.)


Section 7. [Requirements.]

In addition, the Local Provider shall be subject to all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits, fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the Right-of-Way; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Local Provider to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation, policy, resolution, or ordinance proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City. Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project. Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocations or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this Ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider. (Ord. 19230 § 5, 2-24-09.)


Section 6. [Indemnity and hold harmless.]

The Local Provider shall indemnify and hold and save the City, its officers, employees, agents, and authorized contractors, harmless from and against all claims, damages, expense, liability, and costs including reasonable attorney fees, to the extent occasioned in any manner by the Local Provider’s occupancy of the Right-of-Way. In the event a claim shall be made or an action shall be instituted against the City growing out of such occupancy of the Right-of-Way by Facilities of the Local Provider, then upon notice by the City to the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall assume responsibility for the defense of such actions at the cost of the Local Provider, subject to the option of the City to appear and defend. (Ord. 19230 § 6, 2-24-09.)

Section 1. [Generally.]

Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, a Contract Franchise Ordinance is hereby granted to Broadband Dynamics, a telecommunications local exchange service provider providing local exchange service hereinafter referred to as “Local Provider” within the City of Topeka, Kansas (“City”), subject to the provisions contained hereafter. The initial term of this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be for a period of two (2) years beginning October 1, 2010, and ending September 30, 2012. Thereafter, this Contract Franchise Ordinance will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the Contract Franchise Ordinance at least ninety (90) days before the termination of the then current term. The additional term shall be deemed a continuation of this Contract Franchise Ordinance and not as a new Contract Franchise Ordinance or amendment. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(b)(2), as amended, under no circumstances shall this Contract Franchise Ordinance exceed twenty (20) years from the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance. Compensation for said Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be established pursuant to Section 3 of this ordinance. (Ord. 19468 § 1, 9-21-10.)


Section 2. [Definitions.]

For the purpose of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, the following words and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meaning:

“Gross receipts” means only those receipts collected from within the corporate boundaries of the city enacting the franchise and which are derived from the following: (A) Recurring local exchange service for business and residence which includes basic exchange service, touch tone, optional calling features and measured local calls; (B) recurring local exchange access line services for pay phone lines provided by a telecommunications local exchange service provider to all pay phone service providers; (C) local directory assistance revenue; (D) line status verification/busy interrupt revenue; (E) local operator assistance revenue; and (F) nonrecurring local exchange service revenue which shall include customer service for installation of lines, reconnection of service and charge for duplicate bills. All other revenues, including, but not limited to, revenues from extended area service, the sale of lease of unbundled network elements, nonregulated services, carrier and end user access, long distance, wireless telecommunications services, lines providing only data service without voice services processed by a telecommunications local exchange service provider, private line service arrangements, internet, broadband and all other services not wholly local in nature are excluded from gross receipts. Gross receipts shall be reduced by bad debt expenses. Uncollectible and late charges shall not be included within gross receipts. If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided. The term local exchange service shall not include wireless communication services.

“Telecommunications local exchange service provider” means a local exchange carrier as defined in subsection (h) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, and a telecommunications carrier as defined in subsection (m) of K.S.A. 66-1187, and amendments thereto, which does, or in good faith intends to, provide local exchange service. The term telecommunications local exchange service provider does not include an interexchange carrier that does not provide local exchange service, competitive access provider that does not provide local exchange service or any wireless telecommunications local exchange service provider.

“Telecommunications services” means providing the means of transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. (Ord. 19468 § 2, 9-21-10.)


Section 3. [Compensation.]

Compensation made pursuant to this Contract Franchise Ordinance shall be paid on a quarterly basis without invoice or reminder from the City and paid not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the remittal period. Compensation shall be payable from services provided by the Local Provider from the effective date of the Franchise Contract which is contemplated by the parties to be on or after the effective date of the Contract Franchise Ordinance adopted by the Council of the City of Topeka. For the first year of this Contract Franchise Ordinance, said compensation shall be a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the Contract Franchise Ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross receipts; unless the City notifies Local Provider prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to increase or decrease the percentage of gross receipts for the following calendar year. Any increased gross receipt fee shall be in compliance with the public notification procedures set forth in subsections (l) and (m) K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from changing the method of compensation from gross receipts to an access line fee pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, through amendment to the Contract Franchise Ordinance or establishment of a new Contract Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 19468 § 3, 9-21-10.)

Further, the Local Provider shall comply with the following:

a. The Local Provider’s use of the Right-of-Way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City’s use of the Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The Local Provider shall coordinate the installation of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on Public Improvements, as reasonably determined by the City. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the Facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such Public Improvements so as not to conflict with such Public Improvement.

b. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Right-of-Way damaged or removed by the Local Provider in its activities under this Franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the Local Provider without cost to the City, however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City pertaining thereto.

c. Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of Facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, all work including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected.

d. The Local Provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Right-of-Way when requested by the City or its authorized agents for a Public Project.

The Local Provider shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements. At the request of the Local Provider, the City may include design for Facilities in the design of Public Projects. Also at the request of the Local Provider, the City and/or its contractor(s) or agent(s) shall provide accurate and timely field locations of proposed Public Projects in the event the Local Provider is required to install new and/or relocate its Facilities.

e. The Local Provider shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if reasonably necessary and requested by the City for a Public Project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Local Provider without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Local Provider, the Local Provider shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City. Likewise, if additional location, removal, relocation or adjustment is the result of inaccurate or mistaken information of the City, the City shall reimburse the Local Provider for any additional expense necessarily incurred by the Local Provider directly due to such inaccurate or mistaken information. The Local Provider shall only be responsible for removal, relocation, or adjustment of Facilities located in the Right-of-Way at the Local Provider’s sole cost once each five (5) years for that particular facility. The City shall reimburse the Local Provider for the removal, relocation, or adjustment of the Local Provider’s Facilities located in the Right-of-Way if required before the expiration of five (5) years from the date of the last relocation, removal, or adjustment of that particular facility.

The Local Provider shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third (3rd) party upon the request and appropriate documentation of the Local Provider. Before such expenses may be billed to the third (3rd) party, the Local Provider shall be required to coordinate with the third (3rd) party and the City on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The Local Provider may require payment in advance of estimated costs or relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new Public Project for Private Development initiated after the effective date of this Ordinance.

The City may continue to provide a location in the Right-of-Way for the Local Provider’s Facilities as part of a Public Project, provided that the Local Provider has cooperated promptly and fully with the City in the design of its Facilities as part of the Public Project.

f. It shall be the responsibility of the Local Provider to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Local Provider fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Local Provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Local Provider to perform any of its obligations under this Ordinance. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the City and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the Local Provider’s Facilities.

g. All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the Facilities in the Right-of-Way shall be in accordance with applicable present and future federal, state, and City laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the Kansas Corporation Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation, and further, to the extent they are not inconsistent with federal or state laws, the City of Topeka standard technical specifications as may be amended from time to time, or such substantive equivalents as may hereafter be adopted or promulgated. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Franchise may be additional to or stricter than such minimum standards.

h. The City encourages the conservation of the Right-of-Way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this Franchise prohibiting third (3rd) party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Local Provider will permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all Facilities constructed or erected by the Local Provider.

Such facilities are in public rights-of-way (hereinafter “PROW”) throughout the State of Kansas; and

WHEREAS, Grantee seeks to enter the City’s PROW to install, maintain and operate a network of such facilities (the “Network”), so that Grantee and/or its underlying customers (the “Customers”) may provide data and telecommunications services to the residents and visitors of the City (the “Services”); and

WHEREAS, some features of the Network include, without limitation, antenna nodes, poles, equipment cabinets, underground and above ground fiber optic cable, fiber handholes and enclosures, fiber repeaters and related equipment, and will include other equipment as technology evolves, in a configuration and at locations to be filed and identified through the City permit process (“Facility” or “Facilities”); and

WHEREAS, certain advanced wireless antenna systems (“Advanced Wireless Facility” or “Advanced Wireless Facilities”) which are specific part or type of the Facilities may be located on streetlights, stand-alone poles, third party utility poles, and other structures located on or within the PROW as permitted under this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Grantee desires to obtain from City as permitted by law, and City is willing to grant to Grantee as required by law, the right to access the PROW to locate, place, attach, install, operate, use, control, repair, replace, upgrade, enhance and maintain the Facilities and the Advanced Wireless Facilities in a manner consistent with this Agreement.

In consideration of the Recitals set forth above, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the City and Grantee agree as follows:

(b) No Legal Interest in PROW. The grant of this franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the PROW, and shall give only the right to occupy the PROW, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Agreement. This Agreement does not:

(1) Grant the right to use any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;

Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or City regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the PROW). (Ord. 20044 § 2, 12-20-16.)


Section 3. Use of Public Right-of-Way.

(a) No Obstruction. Grantee’s Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner as not to obstruct or hinder travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct use by the City or other users of the PROW.

(b) Use Subordinate to City. Grantee’s use of the PROW is subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may prohibit the use or occupancy of a specific portion of the PROW due to a reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety and welfare so long as such interest is exercised in a competitively neutral manner and is not unreasonable or discriminatory.

(c) Use Subject to Laws. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances (hereinafter “Laws”) adopted by the City, including but not limited to Chapter 12.30 (Right of Way Excavation), Chapter 14.20 (Building Permits) and Chapter 18 (Land Use Regulations) to the extent such laws do not conflict with or are preempted by any federal law or regulation.

(d) Plan Approval. The installation of the Facilities shall be made in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the applicable City department head or designee and after obtaining all necessary permits for work in the PROW and compliance with applicable building codes and land use regulations.

If Grantee fails to make the repairs required by City, then City may do so and require reimbursement from Grantee within thirty (30) days of notice of the costs. (Ord. 20044 § 3, 12-20-16.)


Section 4. Removal Due to Public Project.

Relocation of Facilities. Upon receipt of a written demand from the City, Grantee, at its sole cost and expense, shall remove and relocate any part of the Grantee’s Facilities whenever the City reasonably determines that the removal and/or relocation of any part of the Network or Facilities is necessary to accomplish construction and maintenance activities related to improvements for the health, safety and welfare of the public, including but not limited to the following: (a) work proposed to be done by or on behalf of the City or any other governmental agency, including but not limited to, any change of grade, alignment or width of any street, sidewalk or other public facility, installation of curbs, gutters or landscaping and installation, construction, maintenance or operation of any underground or aboveground facilities such as sewers, water mains, drains, storm drains, pipes, gas mains, poles, power lines, telephone lines, cable television lines and tracks; or (b) interference with the operation of City-owned light poles, traffic signals, or other City facilities. The City shall cooperate with Grantee in relocating any portion of the Network and/or Facilities in a manner that allows Grantee to continue providing service to its customers, including, but not limited to, expediting approval of any necessary permits required for relocation. No permitting or other fees may be charged by the City for a removal occurring pursuant to this section.

Pursuant to 2016 House Bill 2131 (codified at K.S.A. 66-2019 and amendments thereto), Grantee shall relocate or adjust the Network or its Facilities, at no cost to City, within the time set forth in City’s written request provided that City provides a minimum of 180 days advance written notice unless circumstances beyond the City’s control require a shorter period of advance notice. If relocation or adjustment is for private benefit, Grantee is not responsible for the cost of the relocation or adjustment to the extent of such private benefit and Grantee shall not be obligated to commence relocation or adjustment until receipt of funds for such relocation or adjustment. (Ord. 20044 § 4, 12-20-16.)


Section 5. Grantee’s Facilities.

(a) Existing Utility Poles. Grantee may attach its Facilities to an existing utility pole pursuant to a properly executed agreement with the pole owner (City or third party), provided, however, that any necessary replacement of the pole in order to accommodate the attachment shall be subject to the proper exercise of the City’s police powers.

(b) New Poles and other City Facilities. Grantee may install new poles provided the poles comply with applicable City, state and federal specifications, and laws (“New Poles”). In areas where there are existing poles, Grantee will use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the owner of that existing pole to collocate a small cell facility or Advanced Wireless Facility but only when (i) the pole owner is willing to allow such attachment and (ii) such attachment is feasible from a safety, technical, and engineering (structural and radio frequency coverage) perspective and (iii) such attachment is commercially reasonable for Grantee’s business model, in Grantee’s sole discretion.

(c) City Use of New Poles. City may use any New Poles for City purposes, including but not limited to City utilities and operations so long as such use does not interfere with Grantee’s use of its Facilities from a safety, technical and engineering (structural and radio frequency coverage) and subject to Grantee’s approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Grantee shall reasonably cooperate with the City when using the New Poles.

(d) Damage to New Poles. If a New Pole falls or is damaged such that there is an imminent threat of harm to persons or property, then City may cause the New Pole to be removed to the side of the street or a location that City believes reasonably eliminates the risk of such imminent threat of harm to persons or property. Grantee shall, after written notice from the City that any New Pole has been damaged or removed, cause the New Pole to be repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days after the City’s written notice. The cost to repair and/or replace any New Pole shall be paid by Grantee; provided, however, that if the New Pole is damaged or destroyed by the City or a third party user that the City has given the right to use the New Pole, then the City and/or its third party user shall pay the cost to repair and/or replace the New Pole. (Ord. 20044 § 5, 12-20-16.)


Section 6. Interference.

(a) City Public Safety Communications. Grantee’s Network shall not cause interference with public safety communications systems operated by City or any other public agency, regardless of the date such systems or any components thereof have been placed in service.

(b) Correction of Interference. If such interference occurs, Grantee shall, upon receipt of written notice thereof from City, immediately commence commercially reasonable, diligent, efforts to correct or eliminate such interference. If such interference cannot be corrected by Grantee to the reasonable satisfaction of City within the cure period set forth for in the City’s notice, which notice shall not be less than 30 days absent an emergency or danger to public health and safety requiring shorter notice, such interference shall be deemed a material breach under this Agreement and City may terminate. (Ord. 20044 § 6, 12-20-16.)


Section 7. Compensation to the City.

As compensation to City for use of the PROW, Grantee shall pay quarterly to City five percent (5%) of Grantee’s Gross Revenue. Additionally, Grantee shall pay a rental fee of $600 per year for each Facility (e.g. New Pole). The rental fees are in addition to the City’s standard permit fees.

(a) No Invoice. Grantee shall pay without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 30 days of the last day of the quarter for which the payment applies. If the quarterly compensation is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.

(b) Calculation of Compensation. Grantee shall submit to the City a statement, executed by an authorized officer of Grantee or designee, showing the amount of Gross Revenue for the period covered by the payment, and the manner in which the compensation was calculated.

(c) No Accord & Settlement. No acceptance by the City of any compensation shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City.

(d) Verification; City Right to Audit. To verify the correctness of the compensation paid by Grantee and Grantee’s compliance with this Agreement, the City shall have the right to examine, audit, inspect, review, and/or obtain copies of (collectively, “Audit”) at its cost and expense, except as set forth in this subsection (d), the papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other records (collectively, the “Records”) of Grantee pertaining to all revenue derived by Grantee in connection with Grantee’s provision of telecommunications service through Grantee’s Facilities, upon no less than fifteen (15) business days written notice to Grantee (no more often than once per calendar year), to verify the correctness of the compensation paid by Grantee. Grantee shall fully cooperate in making reasonably available its records and otherwise assisting in these activities as is necessary for City to reasonably verify the correctness of the compensation paid by Grantee. The City may extend the time for the provision of such Records upon a reasonable showing by Grantee that such extension is justified. In the event that such audit discloses a discrepancy of more than five percent (5%) between the financial report submitted by the Grantee with a quarterly payment and the actual Gross Revenue collected by Grantee, the Grantee agrees to pay the City the costs of such audit; provided that (a) the City will not be entitled to reimbursement of such Audit costs more than once in any five (5) year period, and (2) the total reimbursement to the City in any five (5) year period for the Audit costs shall not exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the amount of the discrepancy. In the event that such Audit results in a determination that additional compensation is due the City, Grantee further agrees to pay interest as required for late payment on such additional compensation computed from the date on which such additional compensation was due and payable.

(e) Franchise Application Fee. Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Agreement, Grantee shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00). The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Agreement.

(f) Other Taxes; Fees. The compensation required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under K.S.A. 12-2001, 17-1902, K.S.A. 66-2019 and amendments thereto. (Ord. 20044 § 7, 12-20-16.)


Section 8. Indemnity and Hold Harmless.

It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the PROW from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., Grantee shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their gross negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.

Grantee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, its officers, employees, agents, and contractors, from and against liability, claims, demands, losses, damages, fines, charges, penalties, administrative and judicial proceedings and orders, judgments, and the costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of defense to the extent resulting from activities undertaken by Grantee pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent arising from or caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the City, its officers, employees, agents, or contractors. The City shall promptly notify Grantee of any claim, action or proceeding. (Ord. 20044 § 8, 12-20-16.)


Section 9. Insurance Requirement and Performance Bond.

(1) Workers’ compensation as provided for under any worker’s compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers’ liability limit equal to the amount required by law.

(2) Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability with a two million dollar ($2,000,000) general aggregate limit. The Grantee may meet the policy limit requirements above in combination with commercial general liability policies and umbrella liability policies. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee’s operations under this Franchise agreement.

(b) Self-Insured. As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred.

(c) Certificate of Insurance. Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Agreement, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a certificate of insurance or evidence of self-insurance, satisfactory in form and content to the City Attorney, evidencing that the above insurance is in force and will not be cancelled or materially changed with respect to areas and entities covered without first giving the City thirty (30) days prior written notice. Grantee shall make available to the City on request the policy declarations page and a certified copy of the policy in effect, so that limitations and exclusions can be evaluated for appropriateness of overall coverage.

(d) Performance Bond. Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Agreement, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a performance bond in the amount of $50,000, payable to the City to ensure the appropriate and timely performance in the construction and maintenance of Facilities located in the PROW. The required performance bond must be with good and sufficient sureties, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance. (Ord. 20044 § 9, 12-20-16.)


Section 10. Revocation and Termination.

In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Agreement, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and the franchise granted herein, and all such rights and privileges and hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Agreement shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Agreement, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Agreement by action of the Governing Body, setting out the grounds upon which this Agreement is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the Governing Body’s consideration, and shall have the right to address the Governing Body regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the Governing Body to revoke and terminate this Agreement, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas. This Agreement shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the district court’s final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Agreement shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings. (Ord. 20044 § 10, 12-20-16.)


Section 11. Reservation of Rights.

(a) No Waiver of City Authority. In granting its consent hereunder, the City does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, its Home Rule powers under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City.

(b) Reservation of Rights. In entering into this Agreement, neither the City’s nor Grantee’s present or future legal rights, positions, claims, assertions or arguments before any administrative agency or court of law are in any way prejudiced or waived. By entering into the Agreement, neither the City nor Grantee waive any rights, but instead expressly reserve any and all rights, remedies, and arguments the City or Grantee may have at law or equity, without limitation, to argue, assert, and/or take any position as to the legality or appropriateness of any present or future laws, non-franchise ordinances and/or rulings. (Ord. 20044 § 11, 12-20-16.)


Section 12. Failure to Enforce.

The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee.

The additional terms shall be deemed a continuation of this Agreement and not as a new franchise or amendment.

(b) Renegotiation. Upon written request of either the City or Grantee, this Agreement shall be renegotiated at any time upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the City or Grantee, including but not limited to the scope of the franchise granted to Grantee or the compensation to be received by the City hereunder.

(c) Amendment. Amendments, if any, shall be made by franchise ordinance. This Agreement shall remain in effect according to its terms, pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section.

(d) Extension of Termination Date. In the event the parties are actively negotiating in good faith a new franchise agreement, the parties by written mutual agreement may extend the termination date of this Agreement to allow for further negotiations. Such extension period shall be deemed a continuation of this current Agreement and not as a new contract franchise ordinance or amendment. (Ord. 20044 § 13, 12-20-16.)
