A BRIEF HISTORY OF BROWNSBURG, INDIANA



   James B. Brown settled in Brown Township in 1824, thus becoming
Brownsburg's first settler. The area was dense and unbroken wilderness with
only hunters and trappers in the area. Delaware Indians lived in what is now
called Lincoln Township, along White Lick Creek, which was then called
“Wa-pe-ke-way” or “White Salt.”



   In 1928, the first log school house was built in Brown Township.
One-room brick schools were built every four miles. Everyone in the family
except the mothers went to school when it was not crop season. The age range
in the classroom was from six years to 43 years.



   Due to problems with swamp land, the northern part of the county,
including Brown Township, were the last to be settled. Illnesses caused by
the swamp land, then known as “Ague,” affected entire families, with many
dying. In the 1840's, woodland ditch systems were built by Irish immigrants
familiar with bogs in their native homeland to drain the swamps, making the
areas habitable.



   Brown Township was divided in 1863, becoming Brown Township in the
north, being named after its first resident James B. Brown, who was
originally from Kentucky. Lincoln Township was created to the south, being
named after President Lincoln as a sign of support during the Civil War.



   A stagecoach line was established along a road built in 1820 connecting
all of the small outlying communities with Indianapolis.



   The Calvary Methodist Episcopal Church was organized under Reverend
Joseph Tarkington in 1828. It held services in the little red school house
until March 2, 1872, when it moved into its new facilities on Main Street.
The church is presently located on South Green Street.



   William Harris settled in the area north of what is now Main Street on
either side of the current Green Street Area. Selling sections of these woods
to incoming pioneers gave the Town its original name of Harrisburg in 1835.
Mr. Harris marked these original six acres of land by walking off distances
between tree stumps.



   Thomas Lockhard and his 17-member congregation organized the Brownsburg
Christian Church in 1835.



   The post office was established in 1836 under the name of Harrisburg,
but was later changed to Brownsburg, since the name Harrisburg was being used
by a post office in Fayette County.



   The first church building to be erected in Brownsburg was a log
structure, built in 1840 by the Brownsburg Christian Church. From the 1840's
to the 1870's, the Town almost tripled in size, from its original six acres
to more than 16 acres. 1848 brought the area's first election with a total of
ten male votes cast.



   In the late 1840's the “Little Church in the Wildwood” was founded,
with its charter being issued in 1851. In 1881, the current brick building
known as White Lick Presbyterian Church was constructed.



   A group of Christian Pioneers, meeting in the old Watson School House,
organized the Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church in 1851, affiliated with the
White Lick Missionary Baptist Association and the Indiana State Convention.
The James Tarpey Farm was obtained in 1857, and a frame building was erected.



   Brownsburg's only Catholic Church was established in 1869 under the
direction of Reverend D. J. McMullen. The first priest in charge of the
congregation after Father McMullen was Reverend J. L. Brassart. The location
of this original structure is on North Green Street.



   In 1869, the Big Four Railroad opened service to Brownsburg, and by
1910, the Interurban was making daily trips between Indianapolis and
Crawfordsville, with scheduled hourly stops in Brownsburg. A covered bridge
stood on Highway 136 just west of the Town, until 1927.



   During the 1910's and the 1920's Brownsburg residents listened and
danced to music played by its own band performing on a bandwagon in the
middle of the current intersection of Main and Green Streets. Later, the
bandwagon was placed by the Chautaqua held one week in August on the school
playground. Here the community enjoyed listening to speakers and talented
entertainers. Activities later included community fish fries as well as
ten-cent picture shows.



In 1917, Superintendent of Schools Sylvester Moore and his wife, Anne, were
instrumental in the forming of Brownsburg's first public library, funded by
local gifts, as well as a $12,500 gift from the Carnegie Corporation. The new
library, opening with a total of 400 books, named Ottie Roberts as the first
Librarian, who remained in that position until 1944.



   The first two-story schoolhouse was built in 1917 on College Avenue.
Later a gym and another two-story building was added to house 12 grades,
while a school in Brown Township, north on Highway 267, housed grades one
through eight.



   During the 1930's to the 1950's movies at the “Brownie Theatre,” in
addition to the Town fish fries and carnivals at Eaton Park, were held
throughout the summer.



   The Brownsburg Fire Department was officially formed in 1942, as a
Volunteer Fire Department.



   In the 1950's, a roller skating tent was placed on the school property.
Little League sports plus high school sporting activities also began. It was
also during this period of time that the Brownsburg Shopping Center was built
on the east side of Town.



   In 1952 an Elementary School was built east of the gymnasium and
another one added on South Green Street, given the name of South. The late
1950's saw the high school erected on Stadium Drive, while the present high
school was built on South Odell, turning the old building into an
intermediate school for grades five and six.



   The 1960's established Brownsburg as having the largest varsity gym in
the county-wide basketball area, becoming the site for tournaments. The
1970's saw Brownsburg Square Shopping Center on the north side being erected,
and in 1981 a new ultra-modern library with solar energy and a computer
check-out system was built on South Jefferson Street.



   The library is 25,000 square feet and contains over 102,000 books.
Features of the Brownsburg Public Library include meeting rooms, story hour
facilities, an outdoor amphitheater, typing rooms, computers for public use,
video and audio tapes, art prints, and a totally automated circulation
system. Special programs include adult programming, pre-school story hours,
Super Saturday Programs for school age children, Summer Reading Regular
Programs for all ages, “Booker's Bunch” on Thursday evenings, and annual
celebrations during Children's Book Week and National Library Week.



   Brownsburg is proud to sustain over 40 civic organizations with local
and national affiliations, 30 churches of varying denominations, two
community theatre troupes, a Halloween House, carnivals, celebrations, and
several area parks.



   The 1990 census shows the population of Brownsburg to be 7,628 people.
Brownsburg is ideally located just 15 miles from the Indianapolis
International Airport and has seven universities within driving distance.
Nestled in Hendricks County, this former swampy hunting grounds of the
Delaware Indians has grown to be known as a “small town atmosphere with big
city opportunities,” as a result of its hardworking civic and public
officials.

code, as originally enacted, or as added by amendment, are not law, and may
be altered by the compilers of this or any subsequent codification, in any
official publication, to more clearly indicate its content. These descriptive
headings are for organizational purposes only, and do not affect the meaning,
application, or construction of the law they precede.

shall not extinguish or release any penalty, forfeiture, or liability
incurred under such section, unless the repealing section so expressly

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT



§ 31.85  ESTABLISHMENT.



   The Town Council creates an Information Technology Department (the
“ITD”) to coordinate and oversee the Town's purchase and installation of
hardware and software, and to administer the information technology policies
established by the Town. The ITD shall consist of the Town Manager, the
Clerk-Treasurer, the Wastewater Supervisor and the Water Supervisor.



(Ord. 99-06, passed 8-12-99)



§ 31.86  POLICIES.



   (A)   Hardware acquisitions. Installations, moves and repairs.  The
ITD must unanimously review and approve all requests for acquisition, repair,
installation, deinstallation and moves of all hardware and software.



   (B)   Software applications.  All application software installed on
all personal computers or workstations must be legally licensed. A legally
licensed application is one for which the Town or the user has a software
license, master diskettes or a purchase order proving that the software came
pre-loaded on the hardware. Only software licensed by or being evaluated by
the Town can be used by the user. No software applications are to be
installed on the computers without the written approval of the ITD.



   (C)   Computer password and log-in ID.  The ITD will assign all
users a computer password and log-in ID. Users are required to immediately
advise the ITD of any change to their computer password and log-in ID. At no
time shall a user share, obtain, utilize or disclose another person's
password or log-in ID. At no time shall a user's computer password, log-in ID
or identification number be disclosed to, shared with, or used by another
person except the user's manager or director, or the ITD.



   (D)   Access and use rights. The Town's computers and the data
stored therein (the “Town's information”) are to be used for purposes of
conducting Town business, and all other use or access is prohibited. Utmost
care is to be used at all times in protecting the Town's information from
unauthorized access, misuse, theft, damage, destruction, modification or
disclosure. At no time shall a user access or attempt to access any Town
information without having the express authority to do so or in any manner
that is inconsistent with the approved method of system entry. All
information developed by users while on the job or while utilizing the Town's
facilities or resources shall be the exclusive property of the Town.



   (E)   File management and document storage.  All work-related
documents such as spreadsheets, word processing documents, presentations and
other files are to be stored on the network server and not on individual work
stations or floppy diskettes. The network server will be backed up on a set
schedule, but individual users are responsible for backing up their own files
on their assigned workstations or personal computers.



   (F)   Security and confidentiality.  Under no circumstances should
data ever be transported which, if intercepted, would place the Town in
violation of any law. Town departments and employees are responsible for
maintaining the confidentiality of all information which is stored on the
Town's computers, and which is confidential under the Town's guidelines or
under state and federal laws.



   (G)   Virus protection.  No files from floppy diskettes should be
loaded onto the Town's computers unless it is verified that the disk has been
scanned by a virus protection software. No files should be downloaded from
internet or e-mail sources to the Town's network server or any workstation or
personal computer hard drives without being first scanned by a virus
protection software. Any person receiving disk images or programs via the
internet must conduct a virus check on them before executing or distributing
them.



   (H)   Internet access.  Internet access provided by the Town is
provided for purposes of facilitating communications, accessing and sharing
information among world-wide participants, enhancing user access to and use
of relevant job related information and knowledge, and facilitating more
informed, knowledgeable and productive Town employees. Use of the internet
access or any other purpose is strictly forbidden.



   (I)   E-mail access and use.



      (1)   The use of any Town resource for e-mail should be
related to Town business. Only employees or other authorized persons
conducting Town business may use the e-mail systems. The Town reserves the
right to access and disclose the contents of employees' or other authorized
users' e-mail, but will do so only when it has a legitimate business need.
The Town's e-mail systems should be treated like a shared idling system with
the expectation that messages sent or received with respect to Town business
or with the use of Town resources may be reviewed by any authorized Town
official for any purposes related to the Town's business, which may include
the public pursuant to I.C. 5-14-3-1 et seq.



      (2)   The Town will not monitor e-mail as a routine matter,
but will inspect the contents of e-mail during the course of an investigation
triggered by indications of illegal actions, misconduct, protection of health
and safety, to prevent interference with the business of the Town, or to
locate substantive information required for Town business purposes that is
not more readily available by some other means. The Town will also respond to
legal processes and fulfill its obligations to third parties, which may
include the disclosure of an individual's e-mail.



      (3)   The contents of e-mail, properly obtained for legitimate
business purposes, may be disclosed without permission of any employee or
other authorized user. Employees or other authorized users on the Town's
e-mail system have no expectation of privacy in e-mail. The e-mail system,
like any other element in the communication and information storage system,
belongs to the Town. E-mail is subject to discovery by litigants in a lawsuit
involving the Town or third parties. Individuals needing access to the e-mail
of others, to use information gained from that access and/or to disclose
information from the access, must obtain advance approval for the activity
from the ITD.



   (J)   Appropriate use and decency requirements. Town employees
granted access to the Town computers, internet connected resources and e-mail
resources are required to use that access in a way that is consistent with
their job function, regardless of whether the access is off-hours or on the
employee's time. The content of anything exchanged via internet access or
e-mail must be appropriate and consistent with the standards of common sense,
decency and courtesy. The Town's computers, internet-connected resources and
e-mail resources are not to be used to do any of the following:



      (1)   Perform any act which violates state and/or federal laws.



      (2)   Distribute unsolicited advertising.



      (3)   Propagate computer worms/viruses.



      (4)   Distribute chain letters.



      (5)   Seek information about, obtain copies of, or modify
electronic information belonging to other users unless explicitly authorized
to do so by those users or otherwise authorized by state, federal or local
laws.



      (6)   Distribute documents in violation of copyright laws,
licensing agreements and trade secret regulations.



      (7)   Distribute confidential Town information.



      (8)   Access, download or distribute OBSCENE MATTER, which is
defined as any matter that the average person, applying contemporary
community standards, finds that the dominant theme of the matter, taken as a
whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex; depicts or describes, in a
patently offensive way, sexual conduct; and lacks serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value, taken as a whole.



      (9)   Intimidate or harass any person or interfere with the
ability of any person to conduct Town business.



      (10)    Obtain access to the files or communications of others.



      (11)    Attempt unauthorized access to data or attempt to
breach any security measures on any e-mail system, or attempt to intercept
any e-mail transmissions without proper authorization.

NEPOTISM



§ 37.30  NEPOTISM PROHIBITED IN EMPLOYMENT AND CONTRACTING.



   (A)   The Town finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a
policy of conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the Town and
in contracting with the Town, in order to continue to be able to provide
local government services to its residents, and to comply with the new laws
effective July 1, 2012, known as I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21,
respectively.



   (B)   On July 1, 2012, the Town shall have a nepotism policy and a
contracting with a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of
I.C. 36-1-20.2 (hereinafter “Nepotism Policy”) and I.C. 36-1-21
(hereinafter “Contracting with a Unit by a Relative Policy”), and
implementation will begin.



   (C)   The Town Nepotism Policy is hereby established effective July
1, 2012, by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of I.C. 36-1-20.2,

hereof as if fully set out herein.

   (E)   The Town finds that both I.C. 36-1-20.2 and I.C. 36-1-21
specifically allow a unit to adopt requirements that are “more stringent or
detailed” and that more detailed are necessary.



   (F)   The Town further finds that a single member of the legislative
body cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation,
grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority
of a majority of the body and therefore without such authority by the

36-4-6-11 and I.C. 36-5-2-9.4.



   (G)   The Town finds that a single member of governing bodies with
authority over employees in the Town cannot act for the governing body to
make work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such
authority by the majority the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision.



   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the Town
are hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and to demonstrate compliance with these same
policies.



   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the Nepotism Policy is a
violation and may result in the discipline, including termination, of an
employee, or a transfer from the direct line of supervision or other curative
action. An elected or appointed official of the Town who fails to abide by or
cooperate with the implementation, with the compliance and with mandated
certifications of the Nepotism Policy may be subject to action allowed by law.



   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the Contracting with Unit by a
Relative Policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including
termination, of an employee or a curative action. An elected or appointed
official of the Town who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of the
Contracting with Unit by a Relative Policy may be subject to action allowed
by law.



   (K)   The polices created by this section are hereby directed to be
implemented by any of the following actions:

tried before the court and the defendant be ordered to pay such fines as the
court may determine regardless of the payment of any deferral program fees.



   (C)   All amounts collected as deferral program fees pursuant to
subsection (B)(1)(b) above shall be remitted to the Town Clerk and be used
for the payment of legal expenses of the Town incurred in enforcing said

§ 52.26  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   (A)   General prohibitions.  No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes, or could
potentially cause, pass-through or interference with the operation or
performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the
POTW, whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards
or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.



   (B)   Specific prohibitions.  No user shall introduce or cause to
be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or
wastewater:



      (1)   Any substances or pollutants which, by reason of their
nature or quantity, create a fire or explosive hazard to the POTW or the
operation of the POTW, including but not limited to, wastestreams with a
closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140º F (60º C), using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on
an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at
any point in the system) be more than five percent (5%) nor any single
reading be over ten percent (10%) of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the
meter. Examples of these pollutants include, but are not limited to:
gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, kerosene, toluene, xylene, ethers,
alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates,
carbides, hydrides or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid, or gas
which the Town or the Control Authority has notified the user is a fire or
explosion hazard to the POTW.



      (2)   Wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or more than 9.5,
or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;
damage or hazards to the personnel of the POTW; or interference with any
treatment process.



      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in an amount which could
cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference with the
operation of the POTW. Examples of such instances include, but are not
limited to: fats, oils, and greases (FOG), ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw,
shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground
garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, paper,
dishes, cups, milk containers, and aluminum cans.



      (4)   Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD,

concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants,
will cause interference in the POTW.



      (5)   Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150º F
(65º C), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant
resulting in interference or damage, but in no case wastewater which causes
the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104º
F (40º C).



      (6)   Petroleum, oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or
products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or
pass-through.



      (7)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems.



      (8)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except:



         (a)   With the written permission of the POTW via an
authorized agent;



         (b)   At discharge points designated by the
Superintendent; and



         (c)   In accordance with §§ 52.50 and 52.51 of this

      (9)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent
entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair.



      (10)   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed
by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the
treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the Town's NPDES permit.



      (11)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or
isotopes of a half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by
the Superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.



      (12)   Storm water, surface water, groundwater, artesian well
water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate,
deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless
specifically authorized by the Superintendent.



      (13)   Sludges, screening, or other residues from the
pretreatment of industrial wastes.



      (14)   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by
the Superintendent in a wastewater discharge permit.



      (15)   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test.



      (16)   Any wastes containing detergents, surface-active agents
(surfactants), or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the
POTW or receiving stream.



      (17)   Any water or waste containing animal/vegetable-based
oil and grease, whether emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100)
mg/l. Any exceeding of this surcharge limit may be penalized in accordance
with conditions set forth in § 52.31(A)(5). The Town may also recover costs
associated with problems in the collection system and/or POTW resulting from
the discharge.



      (18)   Wastewater, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
containing molybdenum in amounts that restrict the Town from disposing of the
treatment plant's sludge by any of the selected methods of disposal.



      (19)   Wastewater, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
containing mercury in amounts that result in the POTW violating any portion
of its NPDES permit.



      (20)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other
taste-producing or odor-producing substances, in concentrations exceeding
limits which may be established by the Superintendent as necessary, after
treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state,
federal, or other public agencies of jurisdiction of discharge to the
receiving waters.



      (21)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids, such
as, but not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues; or
of dissolved solids, such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate.



      (22)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes
constituting "slug" as defined in § 52.01.



      (23)   Any waters or wastes which may cause any other products
of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse, or to interfere with the reclamation process.



      (24)   Any water or wastes containing pollutants that result
in the presence of toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or
interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving
waters of the sewage treatment plant.



      (25)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not
amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to a degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies
having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.



      (26)   Food waste disposal, including through in-sink grinders
of sink disposal units, except when its use complies with the compatible
pollutant limits set forth in this chapter.



      (27)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water
or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the federal categorical pretreatment regulations or with any
other pretreatment standard set by the Control Authority or specified within
this chapter.



   (C)   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this
section shall not be processed, diluted, or stored in such a manner that they

§ 52.31  ACTION BY TOWN.



   (A)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in § 52.30, and which in the judgment
of the Superintendent may effect treatment works, processes, equipment or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, the Superintendent may do any of the following:



      (1)   Require new industries (or other large users) or
industries (or other large users) with a significant increase in discharges
to submit information on wastewater quantities and characteristics, and to
obtain prior approval for discharges.



      (2)   Reject the wastes, in whole or in part, for any reason
deemed appropriate by the Town.



      (3)   Require pretreatment of wastes to within the limits of
normal sewage as defined in this chapter.



      (4)   Require control or flow equalization of wastes so as to
avoid any “slug” loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the
treatment works.



      (5)   Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or
loadings discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional cost of
having capacity for and treating the wastes.



   (B)   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization
of waste flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall
be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, and subject to
the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.



   (C)   If any user discharges waste causing the Town to utilize sewer
cleaning equipment, purchase chemicals, hardware or other materials for the
purpose of cleaning to remove the grease or other obstructions from sewer
lines, lift stations or wet wells, the Town shall maintain the right to
assess the user for the cost of materials and services.



   (D)   The Town reserves the right to establish by ordinance more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed
necessary.

§ 52.32  PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.



   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge, prohibited materials, slug loads, or other regulated substances.
Detailed plans and operating procedures for facilities are provided, and
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operating
order by the owner at his expense, and shall be subject to periodic
inspection by the Town to determine if the facilities are being operated and
maintained in conformance with applicable federal, state and local laws and
permits. All existing industrial users who have filed a contingency plan in
compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act shall file a copy
of that plan with the Town within ninety (90) days of the adoption of this
chapter. No industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW after the
effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants
into the system until accidental discharge prevention facilities and
procedures have been submitted to the Town. Submittal and review of the plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the facilities and procedures as necessary to comply
with federal, state and local laws and permits.

§ 52.33  CONTROL MANHOLE.



   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable
control manhole, together with any necessary meters and other appurtenances
in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes at the owner’s expense. The manhole, when required, shall be
accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with
plans approved by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the
owner at his expense, and shall be maintained so as to be safe and accessible
at all times. Agents of the Town, the state water pollution control agencies,
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shall be permitted to enter all
properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling
and testing.



   If a control manhole does not exist on site or is not feasible to
install, an internal drainage point can be used upon permission of the
Superintendent. If neither a private control manhole nor an internal
discharge point is practical as the monitoring location, or causes an undue
hardship on the user, the Superintendent may allow the monitoring facility to
be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, and to be located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. Ample room
must be provided to allow accurate sampling and the compositing of samples
for analysis. The manhole, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the
owner's expense.



   Wastewater shall not be diverted because of changes in plumbing or
internal processing from the designated sampling location without prior
notice and approval of the Superintendent.



(`92 Code, § 9-36)  (Ord. 85-22, passed 11-25-85; Am. Ord. 2011-06, passed

§ 52.34  MEASUREMENTS, TESTS AND ANALYSES.



   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole, except for
applications for NPDES permits and reports thereof which shall be conducted
in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the USEPA (40 CFR 136).
In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole
shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer
to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works, and to determine the existence of hazards
to life, limb and property. The particular analysis involved will determine
whether a twenty-four- hour (24-hour) composite of all outfalls of a premises
is appropriate, or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analysis are obtained from
twenty-four-hour (24-hour) composites determined from periodic grab samples.



   All discharges subject to local, state, or federal regulations must
retain and preserve, for at least three (3) years, any records, books,
documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries
relating to monitoring, sampling, and chemical analyses made by or on behalf
of a discharger in connection with its discharge.



   Any required monitoring activities, supplies, laboratory costs (whether
in-house or by a contract laboratory) that must be utilized or performed by
the Town, will be charged to the user. Any tests or services utilized from a
contract laboratory will be charged at the laboratory's rates.

§ 52.35  SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS.



   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the Town and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the Town for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern at rates as are compatible with the rate ordinance.
Special arrangement agreements may be made based upon an allocation of the
WWTP design capacity for a compatible pollutant, and may be subject to
surcharge fees based upon the allocated waste strength or the actual waste
strength, whichever is greater.

§ 52.36  INDUSTRIAL WASTE PRETREATMENT.



   (A)   Pretreatment of industrial wastes from major contributing
industries prior to discharge to the treatment works is required and is
subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (40 CFR 403), and Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures
for Analysis of Pollutants (40 CFR 136), in addition to any more stringent
requirements established by the Town and any subsequent state or federal
guidelines and rules and regulations.



   (B)   Whenever deemed necessary, as determined at the discretion of
the Town and/or the Superintendent, the Superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewaters be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of
this chapter.



   (C)   No user shall increase the use of process water or, in any
way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in
the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other
pollutant-specific limitation established by the Town.



   (D)   Any user discharging to the POTW greater than twenty-five
thousand (25,000) gallons per day of process wastewater, or greater than (5%)
of the average daily flow in the POTW, whichever is lesser, maybe required to
install and maintain, on the user's property and at the user's expense, a
suitable storage and flow control facility to insure equalization of flow
over a twenty-four-hour (24-hour) period. The facility shall have a capacity
for at least twenty percent (20%) of the daily discharge volume, and shall be
equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of
which shall be directed by the Superintendent. A discharge permit may be
issued to any user solely for flow equalization.



   (E)   Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable
substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible
gas detection meter.



   (F)   Industrial users shall provide and maintain in safe and proper
condition, on their own property and at their own expense, facilities to
allow authorized representatives of the POTW or Control Authority to inspect,
sample, or measure discharges subject to regulation pursuant to this
ordinance. Such facilities shall have ample space to allow accurate sampling
and preparation of samples for analysis.



   (G)   Consistent noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements may be the basis for the Town determining that a
user is not a responsible party, for the purpose of rejecting the user's bid
for the sale of goods or services to the Town.

§ 52.37  PRETREATMENT FACILITY.



   Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to
pretreatment or control facilities shall be submitted for approval of the
Town, and no construction of facilities shall be commenced until approval in
writing is granted. Where facilities are provided, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operating order by the owner at
his expense, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the Town to
determine that the facilities are being operated in conformance with
applicable federal, state and local laws and permits. The owner shall
maintain operating records and shall submit to the Town a monthly summary
report of the character of the influent and effluent to show the performance
of the treatment facilities and for comparison against Town monitoring

the company to maintain safe conditions as required in § 52.34.



   (C)   The Superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the
Town bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all private properties through which the Town holds a duly negotiated
easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the sewage
works lying within the easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on
the easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly
negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved.



   (D)   It shall be unlawful to transfer title of any property,
whether residential, commercial, industrial, or otherwise, prior to an
inspection in order to insure compliance with Town ordinances regulating the
proper disposal of both polluted and unpolluted water. The inspection shall
be performed by the Town or its agent(s) at the request of the current
owner(s) or his agent(s) at a cost stipulated in § 40.15, Building
Department Fee Schedule. Any property inspected within six (6) months of the
date of closing shall be exempt from this requirement.



   (E)   Violations must be corrected and a re-inspection conducted to
verify that the corrections have been made prior to the closing of the sale

   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, and from
the Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities shall be available to
the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the
release of the information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state
law. Any request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that the information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes must not be made
available for inspection by the public, but must be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and

§ 52.59  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.



   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice
and opportunity to respond, which threatens to interfere with the operation
of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take any steps necessary, including immediate severance of
the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed.

order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Superintendent may petition the County Court through the Town Attorney
for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater
discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on
activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek any other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.

less than twenty-five dollars ($25) per sampling event. This charge will be
reviewed on the same basis as all other rates and charges in this chapter.



   (C)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and
equitably adjusted to the service rendered to users, the Town shall base its
charges not only on the volume, but also on strength and character of
stronger-than-normal domestic sewage, and shall require the user to determine
the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly
or indirectly, into the sewage system, in such manner and by such method as
the Town may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user
shall furnish a sampling point, as defined in the sewer use ordinance,
available to the Town at all times.



      (1)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed
a biochemical oxygen demand of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter of
fluid or suspended solids in excess of two hundred (200) milligrams per liter
of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-than- normal domestic
waste shall be made on the following basis:



         (a)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. 
There shall be an additional charge of forty-seven cents ($0.47) per pound of
suspended solids for suspended solids in excess of two hundred (200)
milligrams per liter of fluid.



         (b)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD.  There shall be an
additional charge of forty-seven cents ($0.47) per pound of biochemical
oxygen demand for BOD received in excess of two hundred (200) milligrams per
liter of fluid.



      (2)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day
(5-day) biochemical oxygen demand contained in the waste shall be in
accordance with the current edition of Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes, as written by the American Public
Health Association, the American Water Works Association and the Water
Pollution Control Federation.

§ 52.72  BASIS UPON WATER USE.



   The quantity of water discharged into the sewage system and obtained
from sources other than the utility that serves the Town shall be determined
by the Town in a manner as the Town reasonably elects, and thesewage service
shall be billed at the appropriate rates set out in this chapter. For
customers that obtain water service from the Town, the Utility Billing Office
may apply a one-time sewer credit each year to account for quantities of
water that may have been consumed, but may not have been entered into the
sewage system. Customers must submit to the Utility Billing Office the proper
application requesting the one-time credit by December 1 of each year. The
credit will be based on the difference between the average monthly use
subtracted from the requested usage month. The Utility Billing Office will
maintain a policy that details the credit process and the time period that
generates the average monthly use for both established and newer customers.
The Utility Billing Office may also make allowances in unique situations,
such as but not limited to water leaks and their subsequent documented repair.



   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into
the Town's sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of
water supplied by the water utility serving the Town and the water used
thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a
water meter not acceptable to the Town, then the amount of water used shall
be otherwise measured or determined by the Town. In order to ascertain the
rate or charge provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party
shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the Town for the determining of sewage discharge.



   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into
the Town's sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the water utility serving the Town, and in addition, is a user of
water from another resource which is not measured by a water meter or is
measured by a meter not acceptable to the Town, then the amount of water used
shall be otherwise measured or determined by the Town. In order to ascertain
the rates or charges, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or
any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for
the determination of sewage discharge.



   (C)   In the event two (2) or more residential lots, parcels of real
estate or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into
the Town’s sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water
and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then, for
billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each user
and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of the
number of residential lots, parcels of real estate or buildings served
through the single water meter.



   (D)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate or building
discharges sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the
Town's sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess
of ten thousand (10,000) gallons per month, and it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the Town that a portion of the water as measured by the water
meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then
the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and
maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the Town for the determination
of sewage discharge.



   (E)   Where a metered water supply is used for fire protection as
well as for other uses, the Town may, at its discretion, make adjustments in
the user charge as may be equitable.

billed and collected by the Town in the manner provided by law and ordinance.



   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and
billed monthly.



   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owner, but that billing shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in
the event payment is not made as required in this chapter. The owners of
properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the
right to examine the collection records of the Town for the purpose of
determining whether bills have been paid by the tenant or tenants; provided,
that the examination shall be made at the office at which the records are
kept and during the hours that the office is open for business.  Owners of
properties occupied by tenants are liable for the charges incurred for that
property, and pursuant to state law, a sewage lien may be placed on such
properties for these charges if unpaid, whether incurred by a tenant or the
owner.



   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when
due are delinquent and a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the
rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto.

the last bill is less than the amount of the deposit, upon written request by
the customer, the deposit can be applied to the final bill and any remaining
balance will then be remitted to the customer.  In the event any balance
remains unpaid for sixty (60) days from the date of the final bill, the Town
utility may apply the deposit to the final bill without any required action
of the customer.



   (B)   Any customer of the Town utilities, who has paid a utility
deposit on one property, may request that the deposit be transferred or
credited to another property when the final bill for the first property has
been paid in full.



   (C)   Any customer may, by written request, allow the subsequent
owner/occupant of a property to have a deposit retained by the Town for the
credit of the subsequent utility customer.  The final utility bill must be
paid in full, and all other utility transfer information established before
this deposit may be credited to the subsequent utility customer.



   (D)   Pursuant to Indiana statute, any unclaimed utility deposits
shall be transferred to the water operating fund after the period of two (2)
years from the date of final billing for service.

   (A)   These regulations shall hereafter be known and cited as the
Storm Water Utility Ordinance of the Town of Brownsburg, Indiana. 



   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for the Brownsburg Storm Water Utility for determining impervious
surface area, establishing the Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) and
multiplier for storm water users, and for billing and collection.



   (C)   The Town intends to operate its Storm Water Utility under
provisions of I.C. 36-9-23.  The Storm Water Utility will be responsible for
the management of the Brownsburg Storm Water System and will fund storm water
management activities by charging user fees to the owner/renter of each
property containing impervious surface area within the corporate limits of
the Town.



   (D)   All residential properties will be charged a uniform user
fee.  User fees for non-residential will be based upon the amount of
impervious surface area contained within the property.  The amount of
impervious surface area for each property has been determined based upon
measurements using aerial photography, submitted construction plans and by
field measurements.  Public right-of-way is exempt from the user fee.



   (E)   User fees do not relieve any property owner from compliance
with the Town of Brownsburg and/or Hendricks County ordinances and/or other
applicable state and/or federal laws/regulations.

(Ord. 2006-28, passed 11-16-06; Am. Ord. 2012-19, passed 1-10-13)



§ 56.04  STORM WATER USER FEE DETERMINATION.



   (A)   The monthly user fee is uniform for all residential properties
assigned one (1) ERU.  The user fee for one (1) ERU shall be five dollars
($5).  This user fee may be changed from time to time by the Town Council by
ordinance.



   (B)   The monthly user fee for a non-residential property, combined
residential/business property (that is not zoned in a residential district
according to the Town's Zoning Ordinance), or a multi-family property with
five (5) or more units (defined as non-residential) are determined using an
ERU multiplier, which is calculated by dividing the total impervious surface
area within the property by the base ERU of twenty- nine hundred (2,900)
square feet.  This method allows for the non-residential property user fees
to be based upon the amount of impervious surface area within the property as
compared to the amount of impervious surface area of the average residential
property.  For example, a non-residential property with thirty thousand
(30,000) square feet of impervious surface area receives an ERU multiplier of
10.3 (30,000/2,900).  The ERU multiplier shall be rounded to one decimal
place and the minimum ERU shall be one (1).  The ERU multiplier is then
multiplied by the current fee for one (1) ERU to determine the actual user
fee in dollars.



   (C)   Impervious surface areas shall be measured in the field or
based on aerial footprint of impervious surfaces.  Angled rooftops shall be
measured as if they were flat.  All impervious surfaces within the parcel
boundaries of a property shall be measured, with the exception of those
surfaces located within a road right-of-way.  For multi-unit properties, all
units within a single parcel and all impervious surfaces (such as parking
lots and walkways) shall be measured and billed to the property owner.  For
multi-level or multistory structures (containing more than one (1) level),
the footprint of the building and other impervious surfaces shall be measured
and billed to the property owner.



   (D)   A reduction in the storm water user fee, or credit, based on
specific qualifying conditions defined in this chapter may be available to
utility rate payers.  Utility rate payers must successfully complete any
application process required by the Town to demonstrate compliance with this
section.



   (E)   Credit procedures outlined in this chapter are not intended to
be all-inclusive.  Upon approval by the Storm Water Utility, storm water
user fee credits may be allowed for circumstances not described in this
chapter.



   (F)   Upon written notice, the Storm Water Utility may revoke a
credit for good reason, including failure to meet credit conditions or
failure to meet minimum maintenance requirements for BMPs.



   (G)   One-time credits may be issued for services provided to the
Town by a rate payer.  The rate payer shall present the proposed service to
the Storm Water Utility for review and approval.  A credit amount shall be
determined and agreed upon per each service.  The agreed dollar amount shall
be credited on the utility bill one time when the service is complete.
One-time services may include, but are not limited to, the following: a
stream clean-up activity, developing a storm water brochure,
printing/distributing educational information, or developing a storm water
education video.  If such activities or services can be quantified and can
provide a storm water quality benefit, it may be considered for storm water
user fee credits.

§ 56.05  BILLING AND COLLECTION.



   (A)   For non-residential property owners, a database has been
developed consisting of the non-residential property owner's/renter's name,
property address, property's square footage of impervious surface area, user
fee multiplier and monthly user fee.  The billing for non-residential
property owners is based on this database.



   (B)   Charges for storm water service shall be billed by and through
the Town utilities on the monthly utility bill and with the implementation of
related policies. The storm water user fee is billed monthly to the owner or
renter who occupies the property as of the first day of the current month.
Where the property having a delinquent account for charges for storm water
service is served by the Town’s Utility Department, said Department may,
after reasonable notice to the owner and/or customer, shut off the water
service to the property.  Water service may not be restored until the
delinquent account and associated costs have been paid.



   (C)   Storm water user fees are hereby made a lien upon the
applicable corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or premises at or upon
which such fees are incurred.  Storm water user fees shall be the obligation
of the property owner.  In the event the utilities for any particular
property is billed to the tenants or renters of such property,  the storm
water user fee shall also be the obligation of any renter occupying the
property.  Storm water user fees shall be billed to the property owner if
there is no renter known to the Town or in the event the renter of the
property does not pay said fees within ninety (90) days of the due date.  If
the owner does not pay within one (1) month after the owner's first receipt
of the bill, the Town may take action to collect delinquent fees. 
Delinquent fees may be collected in either or both of the following ways (and
also in any other way allowed by law):



      (1)   A civil action may be brought against the renter and/or
property owner.



      (2)   The fees may be recorded in the Office of the Hendricks
County Recorder and certified to the Auditor of Hendricks County, who shall
place the same on the tax duplicate of the county with the interest and
penalties allowed by law to be collected as ad valorem property taxes are
collected.

§ 56.06  EDUCATION CREDITS.



   (A)   Education credits for storm water user fees. Education credits
for storm water user fees are available to all public and private schools or
school systems in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section
that are accredited by the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE).



      (1)    Program eligibility.  In order for a school or school
system to receive an education credit, the school must teach an approved
educational program that educates and informs the students on the importance
of preserving and restoring the source and integrity of water resources
(storm water, ground water and/or surface waters).  Programs must be
approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), IDOE, or the Brownsburg
Wastewater Superintendent (or designated representative).  The program may
be taught in grades kindergarten (K) through 12.  While some educational
materials may be available through the town, as determined in its discretion,
the town’s total contribution of educational materials for any one program
participant shall not exceed $1,000 for any school year.



      (2)   Amount and types of credit.  Prior to the adoption and
effective date of this section, the maximum credit for a school or school
system may be 50% of the monthly storm water user fee for the corresponding
property or properties used for education purposes described herein, and
after the adoption and effective date of this section the maximum credit for
a school or school system may be 100% of the monthly storm water user fee for
the corresponding property or properties used for the educational purposes
described herein.  The credit will be proportional to the extent to which
the program was taught per garde level.  For example: if the program is
completed for all grade levels in a particular school or school corporation,
the full amount will be issued (i.e. a 50% credit prior to the adoption and
effective date of this section, and 100% credit after the adoption and
effective date of this section), but if only half of the grades were taught,
then only half the amount of the credit will be issued (i.e, a 25% credit
prior to the adoption and effective date of this section, and a 50% credit
after the adoption and effective date of this section).  In the event that
the property is used for other activities unrelated to the education purposes
described herein, then the credit will be reduced based on the pro-rata
portion of the property that issued for educational purposes as provided for
herein in comparison to the entire property.



      (3)   Credit application process.  Any public or private
school or school system that is eligible for participation in this program
and who has not participated in the program prior to the adoption and
effective date of this section, shall first need to complete an application
process through the town.  Such process shall include the applicant’s
submittal of written materials determined necessary by the town to confirm
program eligibility, including, but not limited to, identifying property
address(es) and parcel(s) numbers, the type of credit and amount being
requested, and confirmation of the accreditation through the IDOE.



      (4)   Credit certification process.  By July 1 each year, a
qualifying school shall certify, in writing, with the Brownsburg
Superintendent (or designated representative) the programs and grade levels
that were taught in the previous year, and the intended extent to which the
programs and grade levels will be taught during the upcoming year, and shall
also include such other information as may be requested by the town to
confirm compliance with the requirements to this section.  Beginning January
1, 2015, the credit will be based on the previous year’s certification, and
the certification must occur on or before July 1 annually for the credit to
be issued for the following year.  A certification letter will be forwarded
to the Brownsburg Utilities by the Wastewater Superintendent (or designated
representative) so that appropriate billing adjustments may be made.



   (B)   Public education credit for automotive racing events.  An
education credit is also available for qualifying property determined to be
eligible by the town for up to a 25% credit for the annual storm water user
fees, so long as the following conditions are met by the applicable property
owner, and such other reasonable conditions that may be adopted by the town
from time to time.



      (1)   Education must be given to attendees at all events
involving automotive racing events (the “events”) held on the property,
regarding storm water issues, as reasonably requested by the town, including
but not limited to, posting and distributing storm water quality and
pollution prevention materials provided by the town; conducting a reasonable
amount of litter clean-up after such events are held, with assistance from
the town as to supplies, disposal, and the like; making a reasonable number
of promotional announcements at events, with a copy to be provided; by the
town and subject to the reasonable approval of the owner of the property; and
posting a reasonable amount of educational signage provided by the town.



      (2)   The property must be owned by a not-for-profit
organization under applicable laws, and must have a minimum capacity to
accommodate 25,000 attendees or more at each event; and



      (3)   The property owner must successfully complete any
application process required by the town to demonstrate compliance with this
section.

§ 56.07  RECREATIONAL CREDITS.



   (A)   Recreational credits for automotive racing events.  A
recreational credit for up to a seventy-five percent (75%) credit for the
annual storm water user fees is available for qualifying property determined
to be eligible by the Town, so long as the following conditions are met by
the applicable property owner, and such other reasonable conditions that may
be adopted by the Town from time to time:



      (1)   The ratio of the pervious vs. impervious surface on the
property is maintained at a ratio so that the impervious surface area does
not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the entire property;



      (2)   The primary use of the property must be for
recreational-type purposes, including automotive racing support activities,
racing events and camping activities associated therewith;



      (3)   The property must be owned by a not-for-profit
organization under applicable laws, and must have a minimum capacity to
accommodate twenty-five thousand (25,000) attendees or more at each event; and



      (4)   The property owner must successfully complete any
application process required by the Town to demonstrate compliance with this
section.



   (B)   Recreational land use credit.  A seventy-five percent (75%)
credit for monthly user fees may be granted for a property where the primary
function is for recreational purposes.  Recreational functions may include,
but are not limited to. the following:  parks, soccer fields, football
fields, golf courses, camping areas, trails, hiking and common areas.  The
property must have seventy percent (70%) pervious area or more (30%
impervious or less) as compared to the entire parcel area.  Impervious areas
must flow to a pervious area where infiltration into the ground can occur. 
An individual property qualifying for this credit may not be issued more than
seventy-five percent (75%) credit for the property.



   (C)   Credits for trails or access drives. Trails or access drives
that are surrounded by pervious areas may be eligible for user fee credits on
those properties.  One hundred percent (100%) credit may be granted for
parcels that contain only trails or access drives, when a qualifying
vegetated filter strip collects runoff from the trail or access drive.  The
filter strip shall meet the following criteria:



      (1)   The filtering distance of the filter strip must be at
least as wide as the trail or access drive, and requires a minimum slope of
one percent (1%) and maximum slope of five percent (5%) for the slope of the
filter strip.



      (2)   The filter strip must be maintained with vegetation
cover at a density of eighty percent (80%) or greater over the soil surface,
and a minimum vegetation height of four (4) to six (6) inches.  Deep rooting
vegetation is preferred to prevent eroding of the vegetation and to promote
infiltration into the ground.

to an adjustment of the ERU determination and notify the petitioner in
writing of the decision and the basis of the decision within sixty (60)
days.  The reviewer may grant, deny or modify the adjustment requested in
the petition.  If it is determined that the petitioner is entitled to an
adjustment of the ERU determination, the adjustments will be made in the form
of a credit against future storm water user fees.



   (B)   The petitioner may appeal the reviewer's decision to the Town

Regulations and Routes” chapter of the Town Code.



(`92 Code, § 8-240)  (Ord. 95-1, passed 11-21-96)



§ 74.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply,
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   SNOW EMERGENCY.  A condition declared to be an emergency by the Street
Commissioner upon the recommendation of the Police Department, or in his
absence, his authorized representative.



   SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTE.  Those streets or highways so marked in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.



   ROADWAY.  That portion of a street or highway, designed or ordinarily
used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the berm or shoulder.



(`92 Code, § 8-241)  (Ord. 96-5, passed 11-21-96)



§ 74.03  PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTE.



   (A)   Whenever the Street Commissioner, upon the recommendation of
the Police Department, finds, on the basis of falling, snow, sleet, or
freezing rain, or on the basis of a forecast by the U.S. Weather Bureau or
other weather service of snow, sleet, or freezing rain, that weather
conditions will make it necessary that motor vehicle traffic be expedited and
that parking on designated Town streets be prohibited or restricted for snow
plowing and other purposes, the Street Commissioner shall put into effect a
parking prohibition on parts of, or all, snow emergency routes as necessary
by declaring it in a manner prescribed by this chapter.



   (B)   Once in effect, a prohibition under this chapter shall remain
in effect until terminated by announcement of the Street Commissioner, upon
recommendation of the Police Department, in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter; however, any street area which has become substantially clear
of snow and ice from curb to curb for the length of the entire block shall be
automatically excluded therefrom. While the prohibition is in effect, no
person shall park or allow to remain parked any vehicle on any portion of a
snow emergency route to which it applies. However, nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to permit parking at any time or place where it is
forbidden by any other provision of law.



   (C)   Any provision of this chapter which becomes effective by
declaration of the Street Commissioner or upon occurrence of certain weather
conditions shall, while temporarily in effect, take precedence over other
conflicting provisions of law normally in effect. However, it shall not take
precedence over provisions of law relating to traffic accidents, emergency
travel, authorized emergency vehicles, or emergency traffic directions by a
police officer.



(`92 Code, § 8-242)  (Ord. 96-5, passed 11-21-96)  Penalty, see § 74.99

   The Street Commissioner, upon the recommendation of the Police
Department, shall cause each declaration made by him pursuant to this chapter
to be publicly announced by means of broadcasts with a normal operating range
covering the Town, and he may cause the declaration to be further announced
in newspapers of general circulation when feasible. Each announcement shall
describe the action taken by the Street Commissioner, including the time it
became or will become effective, and shall specify the streets or areas
affected. A parking prohibition declared by the Street Commissioner shall go
into effect when designated. For purposes of this chapter, the radio station
over which the broadcast will be announced will be station WQFE, Brownsburg,
Indiana. The Street Commissioner shall make or cause to be made a record of
each time and date when any declaration is announced to the public in
accordance with this chapter.

   Whenever the Street Commissioner finds that some or all of the
conditions which give rise to a parking prohibition in effect pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter no longer exist, he may declare the prohibition
terminated, in whole or in part, in a manner prescribed by this chapter,
effective immediately upon announcement.



(`92 Code, § 8-244)  (Ord. 96-51, passed 11-21-96)  Penalty, see § 74.99



§ 74.06  SIGNS ON SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTE.



   On each street designated by this chapter as a snow emergency route,
the Street Commissioner shall cause to be posted appropriate special signs.
These signs shall be distinctive and uniform in appearance and shall be
plainly readable to person traveling on the street or highway.



(`92 Code, § 8-245)  (Ord. 96-51, passed 11-21-96)  Penalty, see § 74.99



§ 74.07  STALLED VEHICLE ON SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTE.



   Whenever a vehicle becomes stalled for any reason, whether or not in
violation of this chapter, on any part of a snow emergency route on which
there is a covering of snow, sleet, or ice, or on which there is a parking
prohibition in effect, the person operating the vehicle shall take immediate
action to have the vehicle towed or pushed off the roadway of the snow
emergency route, either into the first cross street which is not a snow
emergency route, or onto the public space of a nearby driveway. No person
shall abandon or leave his vehicle in the roadway of a snow emergency route
(regardless of whether he indicates by raising the hood or otherwise that the
vehicle is stalled), except for the purpose of securing assistance during the
actual time necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to a nearby garage,
gasoline station, or other place of assistance and return without delay.

record of each vehicle removed in accordance with this chapter. The record
shall include a description of the vehicle, its license number, the date and
time of its removal, where it was removed from, its location, the name and
address of its owner and last operator, if known, its final disposition, and
the parking violation involved.

this section, he is empowered to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the pertinent construction activity. The stop work order shall be in writing

place or given to the person doing the construction, without the violation or
noncompliance being corrected.

required is proceeding without a building permit being in force. In this
instance, the stop work order shall indicate that the effect of this order
terminates if the required building permit is obtained.

Department of Highways) for compliance with standards for air quality,
drainage, flood control, fire safety, vehicular access, and waste treatment
and disposal on the real estate on which the structure is located. In this

PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO BUILDING AMPLIFICATION SYSTEM



§ 150.80  PUBLIC SAFETY 800 MHZ RADIO BUILDING AMPLIFICATION SYSTEM.



   (A)   General.  Except as otherwise provided, no person shall
erect, construct, change the use of or provide an addition of more than
twenty-five percent (25%) to, any multi-family, commercial, and/or industrial
building or structure or any part thereof, or cause the same to be done which
fails to support adequate radio coverage for the Hoosier SAF-T Radio
Communications System, including but not limited to firefighters and police
officers.



   (B)   For purposes of this section, adequate radio coverage shall
include all of the following:



      (1)   A minimum signal strength of -95 dbm available in ninety
percent (90%) of the area of each floor of the building when transmitted from
the closest Hoosier SAF-T Radio Communications System site;



      (2)   A minimum signal strength of -95 dbm received at the
closest Hoosier SAF-T Radio Communications System site when transmitted from
ninety percent (90%) of the area of each floor of the building;



      (3)   The frequency range which must be supported shall be the
current band of frequencies used by the Hendricks County; and



      (4)   A one hundred percent (100%) reliability factor.



   (C)   When measuring the performance of a bi-directional amplifier,
signal strength measurements are based on one (1) input signal adequate to
obtain a maximum continuous operating output level.



   (D)   Amplification systems allowed.



      (1)   Buildings and structures which cannot support the
required level of radio coverage shall be equipped with any of the following
in order to achieve the required adequate radio coverage:



         (a)   A radiating cable system; or



         (b)   An internal multiple antenna system with or
without FCC type accepted bi- directional 800 MHZ amplifiers as needed.



      (2)   If any part of the installed system or systems contains
an electrically powered component, the system shall be capable of operating
on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least
twelve (12) hours without external power input. The battery system shall
automatically charge in the presence of an external power input.



      (3)   If used, bi-directional amplifiers shall include filters
to reduce adjacent frequency interference. These filters shall be tuned so
that they will be thirty-five (35) dbm below the Hendricks County frequencies.



   (E)   Testing procedures.



      (1)   Acceptance test procedure. When an in-building radio
system is required, and upon completion of installation, it will be the
building owner' s responsibility to have the radio system tested to ensure
that two (2)-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of
ninety percent (90%). Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid
of approximately twenty (20) equal areas. A maximum of two (2) non-adjacent
areas will be allowed to fail the test. In the event that three (3) of the
areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor
may be divided into forty (40) equal areas. A maximum of four (4)
non-adjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the forty
(40)-area test, if the system continues to fail, it will be the building
owner' s responsibility to have the system altered to meet the ninety percent
(90%) coverage requirement.



      (2)   The test shall be conducted using a Motorola XTS5000, or
equivalent, portable radio, talking through the Hoosier SAF-T Radio
Communications System as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A
spot located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for
the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two (2)-way communications
to and from the outside of the building through the Hoosier SAF-T Radio
Communications System. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a
better spot within the grid area will not be permitted.



      (3)   The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and
the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so
that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In
the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will
be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.



      (4)   As part of the installation, a spectrum analyzer or
other suitable test equipment shall be utilized to insure that spurious
oscillations are not being generated by the subject bi-directional amplifier
(BDA) due to coupling (lack of sufficient isolation) between the input and
output systems. This test will be conducted at time of installation and
subsequent annual inspections.



      (5)   Annual tests.  When an in-building radio system is
required, it shall be the building owner's responsibility to have all active
components of the system, such as amplifiers and power supplies and backup
batteries tested to a minimum of once every twelve (12) months. Amplifiers
shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial
installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be
tested under load of a period of one (1) hour to verify that they will
properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the one (1)-hour
test period, and in the opinion of the testing technician, the battery
exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one
(1)-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined. All
other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating
within the manufacturers specifications for the intended purpose.



      (6)   Five year tests.  In addition to the annual test, it
shall be the building owner's responsibility to perform a radio coverage test
a minimum of once every five (5) years to ensure that the radio system
continues to meet the requirements of the original acceptance test.



      (7)   Qualifications of testing personnel.  Personnel
conducting radio system tests shall be qualified to perform the work. All
tests shall be conducted, documented and signed by a person in possession of
a current FCC license, or a current technician certification issued by the
Associated Public-Safety Communications Officials International (APCO) or the
Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA). All test records shall
be retained on the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy
submitted to the Fire Department officials.



   (F)   Field testing. Police and Fire personnel, after providing
reasonable notice to the owner or his representative, shall have the right to
enter onto the property to conduct field testing to be certain that the
required level of radio coverage is present.



   (G)   Exemptions. This section shall not apply to buildings less
than five thousand (5,000) square feet.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 151.01  AUTHORITY.



   The State Legislature has authorized the Town Council to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare of
its citizens pursuant to I.C. 36-7-4-201, including the adoption of storm
water management regulation ordinances.



(`92 Code, § 9-130)  (Ord. 89-14, passed 6-27-89)



§ 151.02  FINDINGS.



   (A)   Much of the Town is subject to frequent flooding of brief
duration, surface water ponding, seasonal high water table, and other
water-related problems far beyond the designated flood areas which are
controlled by ordinance. These conditions are the natural characteristics of
Brookston and Crosby soil types which are found here according to the
Hendricks County Soil Survey.



   (B)   Drainage outlets throughout the Town direct much of the storm
water directly into combination sewers and thus to the new two million, four
hundred thousand (2.4 million) gallon-per-day wastewater treatment facility.



   (C)   Developments within the Town during the last twenty (20) years
have been allowed to attach storm water drainage into these combination
sewers because no comprehensive storm water system to White Lick Creek was
available.



   (D)   A “Preliminary Drainage Study” for the Town, dated July of
1988 by Thomas L. Pugh, Soils and Drainage Specialist, is on file in the
office of the Clerk-Treasurer.



(`92 Code, § 9-131)  (Ord. 89-14, passed 6-27-89)



§ 151.03  PURPOSE.



   It is the general purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to
storm water conditions in residential, commercial and industrial development
from this day forward. This chapter is designed to accomplish the following:



   (A)   To protect human life and improve public health.



   (B)   To minimize expenditures of public funds for the processing of
storm water through the wastewater treatment system.



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and the relief efforts needed
to pump out flooded basements, remove cars from flooded streets, and make
certain that properties are easily accessible in all weather conditions.



   (D)   To maximize the use of all properties and remove the risk of
storm water damage to structures and materials therein (roof water excluded).



   (E)   To minimize damage to public utilities and utilities such as
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in low lying areas of the Town outside the designated flood areas.



   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the wise
development of the natural resource base to provide for the habitability and
usefulness and thus insure the salability of the improved properties.



   (G)   To insure that drainage easements are under the control of the
Town to enforce the protection of those drainage facilities from filling and
other damage by the adjoiners.



   (H)   To insure that the natural flow of water shall not be
obstructed by any man-made land improvement. (This is contrary to Indiana
Supreme Court rulings pertaining to “diffused” water as a common enemy.
The natural movement of surplus water within the Town shall be stopped by no
one without adequate provisions for its removal.)



   (I)   To provide for the domestic tranquility of the people by
preventing the water problems which frequently cause neighborhood disputes
and severe criticism of government for failure to cope with significant
factors which result in adverse living conditions.



(`92 Code, § 9-132)  (Ord. 89-14, passed 6-27-89)



§ 151.04  METHODS OF REDUCING WATER MANAGEMENT PROBLEM.



   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for the following:



   (A)   Prohibiting the development of land without first recognizing
the water management problems and finding methods of alleviating those
problems.



   (B)   Allowing for the passage of excess water from upstream
properties.



   (C)   Planning for the design of storm water retention to prevent an
increase in the rate of runoff flow onto downstream properties.



   (D)   Prevention of ponding on lawns and lots.



   (E)   Controlling erosion and sedimentation.



   (F)   Providing a means for channeling excess ground water into the
storm water system.



   (G)   Requiring a water collection system including proper lot
grading, swales, surface drains, storm sewers, and open outlet ditches.



   (H)   Setting standards for drainage and erosion control design.



   (I)   Establishing easement requirements for maintenance access to
drainage facilities.



   (J)   Coordinating street drainage requirements to the major storm
drainage outlet system and the individual lot drainage needs.

   The Advisory Plan Commission, the Advisory Board of Zoning Appeals, the
Building Commissioner, any designated enforcement official, or any person or
persons, firm or corporation, jointly and severally aggrieved, may institute
a suit for injunction in the Circuit or Superior Courts of the county, to
restrain an individual or government unit from violating the provisions of
this chapter. The Advisory Plan Commission or Advisory Board of Zoning
Appeals may also institute a suit for mandatory injunction directing an
individual, corporation or a governmental unit to remove a structure erected
in violation of the provisions of this chapter. Any building erected, raised,
or converted, or land or premises used in violation of the provisions of this
chapter or the requirements thereof, is declared to be a public nuisance and
as such, they may by abated in such a manner as nuisances are now or may
hereafter be disposed of under existing law.

§ 151.09  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   (A)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes a more stringent restriction shall
prevail.



   (B)   This chapter shall be construed whenever possible as
consistent with the Subdivision Control Ordinance of the Town and with all
the Zoning Ordinances and regulations of the Town, and in conformity with its
Master Plan.



   (C)   (1)   In the event that a project site is determined to
impact or discharge to a sensitive area  the Town may require more stringent
storm water quantity and quality measures than detailed in this section.



      (2)   Sensitive areas include highly erodible soils, wetlands,
threatened or endangered species habitat, outstanding waters, impaired
waters, recreational waters, and surface drinking water resources.

§ 151.10  INTERPRETATION.



   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions
shall be:



   (A)   Considered minimum requirements;



   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body;



   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted

§ 151.11  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger storms can and will occur on rare occasions. Drainage
runoff and intensity can cause drainage structures to overfill and erosion
control measures to fail. This chapter does not imply that these provisions
are absolute fail-safe against every event that the ferocity of nature may
provide. This chapter shall not create any liability on the part of the Town
or any officer or employee thereof for any damages from water or sediment
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made under this chapter.

§ 151.13  DUTIES OF BUILDING COMMISSIONER.



   (A)   The duties and responsibilities of the Building Commissioner
shall include but not be limited to the following:



      (1)   Review each improvement location permit to determine
that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.



      (2)   Review all permits to assure that all structures shall
be safe from storm water and ground water problems.



      (3)   Review all permits to assure that all lots and parking
areas shall be free of ponded water except where storm water retention basins
are planned.



      (4)   Review all permits to assure that all land is
temporarily guarded by sediment and erosion control measures during the
construction phase.



      (5)   Review all permits to assure permanent erosion control
measures are planned to prevent future erosion problems.

§ 151.14  ALTERATION OF WATERCOURSES.



   (A)   Legal drains within the Town are under the jurisdiction of the
County Drainage Board. The Indiana Drainage Act has established seventy-five
foot (75-ft.) easements to both sides of legal drain tile lines and
seventy-five (75) feet from the top of the bank on each side of the legal
drains. Any property owner seeking relief from those easements must meet the
requirements of the Drainage Board and the Town Council.



   (B)   No construction of buildings within the Town shall be
permitted within fifty (50) feet of the tile drains or within fifty (50) feet
of the side slopes of open drains without plans prepared by registered
engineers, land surveyors or architects, certifying that there is adequate
room for maintenance of the drainage facility.



   (C)   Any relocation of a drain shall require a plan approved by the
Town Council, and it shall not discharge water onto downstream adjoiners in
any location different from its existing location.



   (D)   Alterations shall accommodate the following:



      (1)   Existing drain tile from upstream.



      (2)   Diffused water flow from upstream properties.



      (3)   Storm sewers from upstream.



      (4)   The drainage collection system from within the project
or property.



   (E)   Any relocated open channels shall require stabilization
measures to prevent sloughing from layers of seasonally saturated silts and
sands.



   (F)   Required design capacities are found in § 151.16.



   (G)   Roadside ditches shall be altered to meet the needs of
“strip” housing along that road so that driveway crossings may be
installed with adequate cover to prevent frost heave and to be coordinated on
grade with each other. They shall be constructed with side slopes flat enough
to allow easy mowing and maintenance, even though this may require grading
beyond the road right-of-way into the lawns. No driveway culvert shall be
less than twelve (12) inches in diameter nor less than twenty (20) feet long.

§ 151.15  STANDARDS FOR EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES.



   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.



      (1)   The Town  will require a storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures
and materials handling procedures, to be submitted as part of the
construction plans and specifications. Any project located within the Town
that includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land disturbing
activities, resulting in the disturbance of one (1) acre or more of total
land area, is subject to the requirements of this section. This includes both
new development and re-development. This section also applies to disturbances
of less than one (1) acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one (1)
or more acres of land, within the MS4 area. Division (C) of this section
provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. Projects meeting the
coverage requirements of 327 IAC 15-5 (Rule 5) shall also be in compliance
with 327 IAC 15-5.



      (2)   The requirements under this chapter do not apply to the
following activities:



         (a)   Agricultural land disturbing activities; or



         (b)   Forest harvesting activities.



      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the
following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain
provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control
measures:



         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of
closure under 329 IAC 10.



         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under IC 14-34.



         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting
waste pursuant to a permit issued by the department under 329 IAC 10 that
contains equivalent storm water requirements, including the expansion of
landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or outside
the original solid waste permit boundary.



      (4)   For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected
to be one (1) acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own
notice of intent letter, apply for a storm water permit from the Town, and
ensure that a sufficient construction and storm water pollution prevention
plan is completed in accordance with the requirements of this section and
other relevant ordinances.



      (5)   An individual lot with land disturbance less than one
(1) acre, located within a larger permitted project site, is considered part
of the larger permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must
comply with the terms and conditions of the storm water permit approved for
the larger project site. The storm water permit application for the larger
project site must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for
individual lots.



      (6)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner
to complete a storm water permit application and ensure that a sufficient
construction plan is completed and submitted to the Town in accordance with
the requirements of this section and other relevant ordinances. It will be
the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure compliance with this
section during the construction activity and implementation of the
construction plan, and to notify the Town with a sufficient notice of
termination letter upon completion of the project and stabilization of the
site. However, all persons engaging in construction and land disturbing
activities on a permitted project site meeting the applicability requirements
must comply with the requirements of this section.



   (B)   Policy on storm water pollution prevention.  Effective storm
water pollution prevention on construction sites is dependent on a
combination of preventing movement of soil from its original position
(erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a waterbody
(sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling. The developer must
submit to the Town a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans
as well as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and
construction sequencing. The following principles apply to all
land-disturbing activities and should be considered in the preparation of a
storm water pollution prevention plan within the Town.



      (1)    Minimize the potential for erosion by designing a
development that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and
fills in areas with steep slopes should be avoided whenever possible, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.



      (2)   Existing natural vegetation should be retained and
protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent (within thirty-five
(35) feet of top of bank) to watercourses and lakes also should be left
undisturbed wherever possible. Unvegetated or vegetated areas with less than
seventy percent (70%) cover that are scheduled or likely to be left inactive
for fifteen (15) days or more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized
with measures appropriate for the season to reduce erosion potential.
Alternative measures to site stabilization may be acceptable if the project
site owner or their representative can demonstrate they have implemented and
maintained erosion and sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment
discharge from the inactive area. Vegetated areas with a density of less than
seventy percent (70%) shall be restabilized using appropriate methods to
minimize the erosion potential.



      (3)   All practices on a site should be conducted in a logical
sequence so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the
shortest practical period of time during development.



      (4)   The length and steepness of designed slopes should be
minimized to reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be
designed and adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant
velocities will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet.
Methods for determining acceptable velocities are located in the Hendricks
County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.



      (5)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the
project site shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures
appropriate to minimize sedimentation. A stable construction site access
shall be provided at all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to
the project site.



      (6)   Storm water runoff leaving a project site must be
discharged in a manner that is consistent with applicable state or federal
law.



      (7)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent
wastes or unused building materials, including garbage, debris, packaging
material, fuels and petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes,
cleaning wastes, wastewater, concrete truck washout, and other substances
from being carried from a project site by runoff or wind. Identification of
areas where concrete truck washout is permissible must be clearly posted at
appropriate areas of the site. Wastes and unused building materials shall be
managed and disposed of in accordance with all applicable state statutes and
regulations. Proper storage and handling of materials such as fuels or
hazardous wastes, and spill prevention and cleanup measures shall be
implemented to minimize the potential for pollutants to contaminate surface
or ground water or degrade soil quality.



      (8)   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of
accumulated sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of
accumulated sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared
sediment shall be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in
accordance with all applicable statutes and regulations.



      (9)   Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either
discharged directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel, or
diffused and released to the adjacent property without causing an erosion or
pollutant problem to the adjacent property owner.



      (10)     Natural features, including wetlands and sinkholes,
shall be protected from pollutants associated with storm water runoff.



      (11)    (a)   The project site owner shall post a notice
near the main entrance of the project site. For linear projects sites, such
as a pipeline or highway, the notice must be placed in a publicly accessible
location near the project field office. The notice must be maintained in a
legible condition and contain the following information:



            1.   Copy of the completed NOI letter and the
NPDES permit number, where applicable.



            2.   Name, company name, telephone number, e-mail
address (if available), and address of the project site owner or a local
contact person.



            3.   Location of the construction plan if the
project site does not have an on-site location to store the plan.



         (b)   This permit and posting of the notice does not
provide the public with any right to trespass on a project site for any
reason, nor does it require that the project site owner allow members of the
public access to the project site.



      (12)     All storm water quality measures must be designed
and installed under the guidance of a trained individual.



   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications. 



      (1)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for
the purposes of determining applicability of this section to the project, the
following guidelines should be used:



         (a)   Off-site construction activities that provide
services (for example, road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to
a land disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total
land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under
the control of the project site owner.



         (b)   Strip developments will be considered as one (1)
project site and must comply with this chapter unless the total combined
disturbance on all individual lots is less than one (1) acre and is not part
of a larger common plan of development or sale.



         (c)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are
regulated by this rule, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by
adding the total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads,
utilities, or common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each
individual lot, as determined by the following:



            1.   For a single-family residential project site
where the lots are one-half (0.5) acre or more, one-half (0.5) acre of land
disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance.



            2.   For a single-family residential project site
where the lots are less than one-half (0.5) acre in size, the total lot must
be calculated as being disturbed.



            3.   To calculate lot disturbance on all other
types of project sites, such as industrial and commercial project sites, a
minimum of one (1) acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot
disturbance, unless the lots are less than one (1) acre in size, in which
case the total lot must be calculated as being disturbed.



      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and
placement of all storm water pollution prevention measures for construction
sites shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined
in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual or the Hendricks County Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in these two
(2) references are in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the
requirements of IDEM's Rule 5.



   (D)   Submittal requirements.  For those projects meeting the
requirements of this section, a construction storm water pollution prevention
plan is required in addition to the submittal requirements listed in §
151.12. This plan must include the following information:



      (1)   IDEM Notice of Intent (NOI) form along with the
information required by the NOI form.



      (2)   Proof of publication in a newspaper of general
circulation, in the affected area, that notified the public that a
construction activity is to commence. The publication must include the
following language:



"(Company name, address) is submitting an NOI letter to notify the Town of
Brownsburg and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management of our
intent to comply with the requirements of the Storm Water Management
Ordinance, as well as the requirements of 327 IAC 15-5 and 327 IAC 15-13, to
discharge storm water from construction activities for the following project:
(name of the construction project, address of the location of the
construction project, and Parcel Identification Number). Run-off from the
project site will discharge to (stream(s) receiving the discharge(s))."



      (3)   Construction plans shall contain the information
required by 327 IAC 15-5-6.5 "Requirements for Construction Plans".



   (E)   Inspection, maintenance, recordkeeping and reporting.

by the Town  and commencement of construction activities, the Town  has the
authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with
the provisions of this section, the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and
the terms and conditions of the approved permit.



      (2)   A self-monitoring program must be implemented by the
project site owner to ensure the storm water pollution prevention plan is
working effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to the Town, shall
perform a written evaluation of the project site by the end of the next
business day following each measurable storm event. If there are no
measurable storm events within a given week, the site should be monitored at
least once in that week. Weekly inspections by the trained individual shall
continue until the entire site has been stabilized and a notice of
termination has been issued. The trained individual should look at the
maintenance of existing storm water pollution prevention measures, including
erosion and sediment control measures, drainage structures, and construction
materials storage/ containment facilities, to ensure they are functioning
properly. The trained individual should also identify additional measures,
beyond those originally identified in the storm water pollution prevention
plan, necessary to remain in compliance with all applicable statutes and
regulations.



      (3)   The resulting evaluation reports must include the name
of the individual performing the evaluation, the date of the evaluation,
problems identified at the project site, and details of maintenance,
additional measures, and corrective actions recommended and completed.



      (4)   The storm water pollution prevention plan shall serve as
a guideline for storm water quality, but should not be interpreted to be the
only basis for implementation of storm water quality measures for a project
site. The project site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance
with this chapter, all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted
storm water runoff. Recommendations by the trained individual for modified
storm water quality measures should be implemented.



      (5)   The project site owner shall inform all general
contractors, construction management firms, grading or excavating
contractors, utility contractors, and the contractors that have primary
oversight on individual building lots of the terms and conditions of this
rule and the conditions and standards of the storm water pollution prevention
plan and the schedule for proposed implementation.



      (6)   Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be
submitted to the Town, the Town has the right to request complete records of
maintenance and monitoring activities involving storm water pollution
prevention measures. All evaluation reports for the project site must be made
available to the Town, in an organized fashion, within forty-eight (48) hours
of the request.



      (7)   The Town reserves the right to perform inspections and
provide recommendations to evaluate the installation, implementation and
maintenance of control measures and management practices at any project site
involved in construction activities.



      (8)   Construction project sites will be prioritized based on
the nature and extent of the construction activity, topography and the
characteristics of soils and receiving water quality.



      (9)   If after a recommendation is provided to the project
site owner, corrective action is not taken, the Town will pursue enforcement
according to § 151.99.



   (F)   Project termination.



      (1)   The project site owner shall plan an orderly and timely
termination of the construction activities, including the implementation of
storm water quality measures that are to remain on the project site.



      (2)   The project site owner, or a representative thereof,
shall submit an IDEM notice of termination (NOT) form to the Town and IDEM
upon project termination once the following requirements are met:



         (a)   All land disturbing activities, including
construction on all building lots, have been completed.



         (b)   Final stabilization of the entire site has been
completed.



         (c)   All permanent storm water quality measures (if
required) have been implemented and are operational.



         (d)   Temporary erosion and sediment control measures
have been removed.



      (3)   The NOT must be submitted to the Town within two (2)
weeks of project termination, and contain a statement(s) verifying that each
of these conditions have been met.

beneficial interest of or in the employ of the agency.



   (E)   Severability. The provisions of this subchapter are hereby
declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of
this subchapter or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or
circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the
other provisions or application of this subchapter.



   (F)   Ultimate responsibility. The standards set forth herein and
promulgated pursuant to this subchapter are minimum standards; therefore this
subchapter does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will
ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized
discharge of pollutants.



   (G)   Discharge prohibitions.



      (1)   Prohibition of illegal discharges.  No person shall
discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters
containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards, other than storm water.



      (2)   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal
discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as
follows:



         (a)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge
prohibitions established by this subchapter: water line flushing or other
potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream
flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not
including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air
conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles,
natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated
- typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any
other water source not containing pollutants.



         (b)   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized
enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.



         (c)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but
requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to
the time of the test.



         (d)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm
water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge
order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the
Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in
full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and
other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has
been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.



      (3)   Prohibition of illicit connections.



         (a)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued
existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.



         (b)   This prohibition expressly includes, without
limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the
connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.



         (c)   A person is considered to be in violation of this
subchapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or
allows such a connection to continue.



   (H)   Suspension of MS4 access.



      (1)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency
situations.  The Town may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.



      (2)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. 
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subchapter may have
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized
enforcement agency.



   (I)   Industrial or construction activity discharges.  Any person
subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge
permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance
with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town prior to
the allowing of discharges to the MS4.



   (J)   Monitoring of discharges.



      (1)   Applicability.  This division applies to all facilities
that have storm water discharges associated with industrial activity,
including construction activity.



      (2)   Access to facilities.



         (a)   The Town or representative thereof shall be
permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this
subchapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
subchapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.



         (b)   Facility operators shall allow the Town ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.



         (c)   The Town shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.



         (d)   The Town has the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.



         (e)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and
easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Town and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.



         (f)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town access to
a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of
this subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES
permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits
an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this subchapter.



         (g)   If the Town has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.



   (K)   Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water
pollutants by the use of best management practices. The Town will adopt
requirements identifying best management practices for any activity,
operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this division. These BMPs shall be
part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.



   (L)   Notification of spills.



      (1)   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as
any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for  a facility or operation has information of any
known  or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result
in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm
drain system, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps
to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the
event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person
shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written report filed with the Town and the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) within five (5) days of
the spill. The written report shall specify:



         (a)   The composition of the discharge;



         (b)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the
discharge;



         (c)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental
discharge, and all measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence;



         (d)   The name and telephone number of the person making
the report, and the name and telephone number of a person who may be
contacted for additional information on the matter.



      (2)   This requirement does not relieve discharger from
notifying other entities as required by state or federal regulations.



      (3)   If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be
retained for at least three (3) years.



   (M)   Enforcement.



      (1)   Notice of violation. Whenever the Town finds that a
person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
subchapter, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written
notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require
without limitation:



         (a)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and
reporting;



         (b)   The elimination of illicit connections or
discharges;



         (c)   That violating discharges, practices, or
operations shall cease and desist;



         (d)   The abatement or remediation of storm water
pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;



         (e)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and
remediation costs; and



         (f)   The implementation of source control or treatment
BMPs.



      (2)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of
affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within
which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental
agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the
violator.



   (N)   Appeal of notice of violation.  Any person receiving a notice
of violation may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement
agency. The notice of appeal must be filed with the Town within ten (10) days
from the date of the notice. Hearing on the appeal before the Town Council
shall take place within fifteen (15) days from the date of its receipt of the
notice of appeal. The decision of the Town Council shall be final.



   (O)   Enforcement measures after appeal.  If the violation has not
been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of
violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten (10) days of the
decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the authorized
enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized enforcement agency
shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any
and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the
property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in
possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or
designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth
above.



   (P)   Cost of abatement of the violation.  Within thirty (30) days
after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified
of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner
may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within
ten (10) days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as
determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special
assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property
for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions
of this subchapter shall become liable to the Town by reason of such
violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than twelve (12) equal
payments. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum shall be
assessed on the balance beginning on the first day following discovery of the
violation. If such amount is not timely paid, then the authorized enforcement
agency may authorize the amount due and unpaid to the Treasurer of Hendricks
County to be collected as taxes.



   (Q)   Injunctive relief.  It shall be unlawful for any person to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
subchapter. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions
of this subchapter, the authorized enforcement agency may petition for a
preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.



   (R)   Compensatory action.  In lieu of enforcement proceedings,
penalties, and remedies authorized by this subchapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory
actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops,
creek cleanup, etc.



   (S)   Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the
enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or
permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this subchapter
is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed
a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken.



   (T)   Remedies not exclusive.  The remedies listed in this
subchapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any
applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the
authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.

§ 151.40 STORM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST- CONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.



      (1)   The storm water permit application must include
post-construction storm water quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat storm
water runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the Town
that includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land disturbing
activities, resulting in the disturbance of one (1) acre or more of total
land area, is subject to the requirements of this section. This includes both
new development and re-development, and disturbances of less than one (1)
acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if
the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one (1) or more acres of land,
within the MS4 area.



      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the
following activities:



         (a)   Agricultural land disturbing activities; or



         (b)   Forest harvesting activities; or



         (c)   Construction activities associated with a
single-family residential dwelling disturbing less than five (5) acres, when
the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale; or



         (d)   Single-family residential developments consisting
of four (4) or less lots; or



         (e)   A single-family residential strip development
where the developer offers for sale or lease without land improvements and
the project is not part of a larger common plan of development of sale; or



         (f)   Individual building lots within a larger permitted
project.



      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the
following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain
provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control
measures:



         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of
closure under 329 IAC 10.



         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under IC 14-34.



         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting
waste pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent storm water
requirements, including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction
of new cells either within or outside the original solid waste permit
boundary.



      (4)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner
to ensure proper construction and installation of all storm water best
management practices (BMPs) in compliance with this chapter and with the
approved storm water management permit, and to notify the Town with a
sufficient notice of termination letter upon completion of the project and
stabilization of the site. However, all eventual property owners of storm
water quality facilities meeting the applicability requirements must comply
with the requirements of this chapter and this section.



   (B)   Policy on storm water quality management.



      (1)   New development and re-development must implement best
management practices (BMPs) for the management of total suspended solids
(TSS).



      (2)   The project site owner must submit to the Town a storm
water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that would show placement of
appropriate BMPs from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the Hendricks
County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The noted BMPs must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the Hendricks County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list may be
utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance
(minimum eighty percent (80%) TSS removal) and ease of maintenance of such
practices will be according to guidelines provided in the Hendricks County
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant.
The anticipated average TSS removal rate for extended dry detention and wet
detention facilities shall be eighty percent (80%).



      (3)   Details regarding the procedures and criteria for
consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are provided in the Hendricks County
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.



      (4)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install
appropriate practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new
facilities and existing facilities that replace their tanks.



      (5)   Infiltration practices will not be allowed in wellhead
protection areas. Discharges will not be allowed directly into sinkholes or
fractured bedrock, without treatment that results in the discharge meeting
Indiana ground water quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.



      (6)   Any storm water practice that is a Class V injection
well must ensure that the discharge from such practices meets Indiana ground
water quality standards as referenced in 327 IAC 2-11.



   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.



      (1)   Calculation of land disturbance should follow the

placement of all storm water quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual or the Hendricks County Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in these two (2)
references are in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the
requirements of IDEM's Rule 13.



   (D)   Easement requirements.  All storm water quality management
systems, including detention or retention basins, filter strips, pocket
wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems, conveyance systems,
structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-of-way shall be
incorporated into permanent easements.



   (E)   Submittal requirements.  A post-construction storm water
pollution prevention plan is required in addition to the submittal
requirements listed in § 151.12. This plan must include the following
information:



      (1)   A description of potential pollutant sources from the
proposed land use that may reasonably be expected to add a significant amount
of pollutants to storm water discharges.



      (2)   Location, dimensions, detailed specifications, and
construction details of all post-construction storm water quality measures.



      (3)   A description of measures that will be installed to
control pollutants in storm water discharges that will occur after
construction activities have been completed. Such practices include
infiltration of runoff, flow reduction by use of open vegetated swales and
natural depressions, buffer strip and riparian zone preservation, filter
strip creation, minimization of land disturbance and surface imperviousness,
maximization of open space, and storm water retention and detention ponds.



      (4)   Calculations demonstrating the required water quality
treatment volume or water quality treatment rate for post-construction storm
water quality measures.



      (5)   A sequence describing when each post-construction storm

      (6)   Storm water quality measures that will remove or
minimize pollutants from storm water runoff.



      (7)   Storm water quality measures that will be implemented to
prevent or minimize adverse impacts to stream and riparian habitat.



      (8)   A narrative description of the maintenance guidelines
for all post-construction storm water quality measures to facilitate their
proper long term function. This narrative description shall be made available
to future parties who will assume responsibility for the operation and
maintenance of the post-construction storm water quality measures.



   (F)   Inspection, maintenance, recordkeeping and reporting.



      (1)   After approval of the storm water management permit by
the Town and the commencement of construction activities, the Town has the
authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the Hendricks County
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and conditions of the
approved permit.



      (2)   Storm water quality facilities shall be maintained in
good condition, in accordance with the Operation and Maintenance procedures
and schedules listed in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual or the
Hendricks County Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and
conditions of the approved storm water permit, and shall not be subsequently
altered, revised, or replaced except in accordance with the approved storm
water permit, or in accordance with approved amendments or revisions in the
permit. Following construction completion, inspection and maintenance of
storm water quality facilities shall be the long-term responsibility of the
owner(s) of the storm water quality facilities. Storm water
detention/retention basins may be donated to the Town for ownership and
permanent maintenance providing the Town is willing to accept responsibility.



      (3)   The Town also has the authority to perform long-term
inspection of all public or privately owned storm water quality facilities.
The inspections will follow the operation and maintenance procedures included

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, AND
OBJECTIVES



§ 152.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Indiana Legislature has, in I.C. 36-7-4 and I.C. 14-28-4, granted
the power to local government units to control land use within their
jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council does hereby adopt the following
flood management regulations.



(`92 Code, § 9-160)  (Ord. 94-39, passed 11-10-94; Am. Ord. 2009-13, passed
8-27-09)



§ 152.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic
inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods or hazardous to other lands that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.



(Ord. 2009-13, passed 8-27-09)



§ 152.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas, by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers  involved in the accommodation of
flood waters;



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that
may increase erosion or flood damage;



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to
other lands; and



   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for
structures and their contents in the Town by fulfilling the requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program.



(`92 Code, § 9-161)  (Ord. 94-39, passed 11-10-94; Am. Ord. 2009-13, passed
8-27-09)



§ 152.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To protect human life and health;



   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in floodplains;



   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize
flood-blight areas; and



   (G)   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property
is in a flood area.

DEFINITIONS



§ 152.05  DEFINITIONS.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.



   A ZONE.  Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of
flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A
zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE,
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The
definitions are presented below:



      ZONE A.  Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual
chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



      ZONE AE and ZONES A1-A30. Areas subject to inundation by the
one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base
flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of
ZONES A1-A30.)



      ZONE AO.  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual
chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain), where
average depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet. Average flood depths
derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.



      ZONE AH.  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual
chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
one (1) to three (3) feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.



      ZONE AR.  Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



      ZONE A99.  Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual
chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of
an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of
special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction
of a protection system, such as dikes, dams and levees, to consider it
complete for insurance-rating purposes. ZONE A99 may only be used when the
flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward
completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).  A structure that is
located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure, and the
use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY
STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used
for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential.
Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage
sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.



   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).  Any walled and roofed expansion
to the perimeter of a structure, in which the ADDITION is connected by a
common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed
addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.



   APPEAL.  A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.



   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.  A designated AO or AH Zone on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), with base flood depths from one
(1) to three (3) feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity
flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).  The elevation of the one-percent annual
chance flood.



   BASEMENT.  That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade
(below ground level) on all sides.

   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS). A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.



   CRITICAL FACILITY.  A facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations that produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.



   DEVELOPMENT.  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to, the following:

      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences,
construction of roads, or similar projects;



      (4)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees,
dikes, dams, channel improvements, and the like;



      (5)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation or
drilling operations;

issued by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard
have been identified as Zone A.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).  An official map of a community, on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.



   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).  The official hydraulic and hydrologic
report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the
FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.



   FLOODPLAIN.  The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland,
lake or watercourse that have been, or hereafter may be, covered by the
regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the floodway
fringe districts.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.  The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving
and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including
but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works,
floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.  This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power that
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state
or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REGULATIONS are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.



   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG).  The elevation of the regulatory flood
plus two (2) feet at any given location in the SFHA.  See FREEBOARD.



   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING).  A method of protecting a structure
that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation, with
walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated
debris-impact forces.



   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.  A form used to certify compliance for
nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or
above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional
engineer or architect.



   FLOODWAY.  The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel that are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river
or stream.



   FREEBOARD.  A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the
BFE, that is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.



   FRINGE.  Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.



   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY.  A facility that cannot be used for
its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity
to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood
processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales or service facilities.



   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS CHAPTER).  The exceptional
HARDSHIP that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance.
The Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
HARDSHIP alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional HARDSHIP. All
of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.



   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.



   HISTORIC STRUCTURE.  Any structure individually listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites
and Structures.



   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required
to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local
flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal
and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after
June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.



   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT(LOMA). An amendment to the currently effective
FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA. A LOMA is
only issued by FEMA.



   LETTER OF MAP REVISION(LOMR).  An official revision to the currently
effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations and elevations.



   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by
letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the
BFE and excluded from the SFHA.



   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.

at or above the BFE and construction meets requirements of division (6)(a); or



      (6)   The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than
a basement, below an elevated structure, where the walls of the enclosure
provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters, unless:



         (a)   The walls are designed to automatically equalize
the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters, by providing a minimum of two (2) openings (in addition to
doorways and windows) having a total area of one (1) square foot for every
one (1) square feet of enclosed area. The bottom of all such openings shall
be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and



         (b)   Such enclosed space shall be usable for the
parking of vehicles and building access.



   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one (1) or more
sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed for use, with or without

parcel of land, which has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no
alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map
that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA).



   MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number followed by a letter suffix
assigned by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map
panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has
been revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the
first revision.)



   MARKET VALUE.  The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to
between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real
estate market will bear. MARKET VALUE can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual
cash value), or adjusted assessed values.



   MITIGATION.  Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term
risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of
MITIGATION is two-fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the
cost of disaster response and recovery.

projecting into any watercourse that may alter, impede, retard or change the
direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its
likelihood of being carried downstream.



   ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR FLOOD).  The flood that has a one
percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood

   PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR).  An official republication of a
community's FEMA map to effect changes to base (one-percent annual chance)
flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and
planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural
works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard
areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.



   POST-FIRM CONSTRUCTION.  Construction or substantial improvement that
started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community
or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.

permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for
use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for
recreational camping, travel or seasonal use.



   REGULAR PROGRAM.  The phase of the community's participation in the
NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed
and higher amounts of insurance are available, based upon risk zones and
elevations determined in a FIS.



   REGULATORY FLOOD.  The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of
being equalized or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and
procedure acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood
elevation at any location is as defined in § 152.07 of this chapter. The
REGULATORY FLOOD is also known by the terms “base flood”, one-percent
annual flood” and “100-year flood”.



   REPETITIVE LOSS.  Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on
two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period ending on the date
of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of
repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five
percent (25%) of the market value of the structure at the time of each such
flood event.



   SECTION 1316.  That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of
1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be
provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a
duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public
body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations or ordinances,
which intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or
occupancy in flood-prone areas.



   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).  Those lands within the
jurisdictions (including extraterritorial jurisdictions) of the Town subject
to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the Town are generally
identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of Hendricks County and
Incorporated Areas prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
dated September 25, 2009. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE,
A1-A30, AH, AR, A99 or AO.)



   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  Includes substantial improvement, and means
the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within one hundred
eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first
placement or permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured
home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of
piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation
for placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial
improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.



   STRUCTURE.  A STRUCTURE that is principally above ground and is
enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank,
a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days.



   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the “start
of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage” or repetitive loss, regardless of the
actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of
structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary
or safety code requirements, or any alteration of a “historic structure”;
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a “historic structure”.



   SUSPENSION.  The removal of a participating community from the NFIP
because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.



   VARIANCE.  A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter,
which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter,
where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.



   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without
the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required
in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.



   WATERCOURSE.  A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.



   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION.  The height, in relation to the North
American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), National Geodetic Vertical Datum
of 1929 (NGVD) or other datum, where specified, of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.



   X ZONE.  The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the
SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate
areas subject to inundation by the flood with a two-tenths percent (0.2%)
chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C
zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability
of flooding is less than two-tenths percent (0.2%).



   ZONE.  A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the
severity or type of flooding in the area.



   ZONE A.  See definition for A ZONE.



   ZONES B, C AND X.  Areas identified in the community as areas of
moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated
rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is
available in participating communities, but is not required by regulation in
these zones. (ZONE X is used on new and revised maps in place of ZONES B AND
C.)

§ 152.07  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING REGULATORY FLOOD DATA.



   This chapter's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best
available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees
with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering
study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.



   (A)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for
the studied SFHAs of the Town  shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Hendricks County and Incorporated
Areas, and the corresponding FIRM prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and dated September 25, 2009.



   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway and fringe limits for
each of the unstudied SFHAs of the Town delineated as an “A Zone” on the
FIRM of Hendricks County and Incorporated Areas shall be according to the
best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.

§ 152.11  DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND
ELEVATIONS.



   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.



   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base
flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.



   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is
above the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the
SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner
should be advised to apply for a LOMA.

§ 152.13  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes, and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the Town, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.



(`92 Code, § 9-170)  (Ord. 94-39, passed 11-10-94; Am. Ord. 2009-13, passed
8-27-09) 



§ 152.14  INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).



   In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC
coverage as a “repetitive loss structure”, the National Reform Act of
1994 requires that the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance,
and incur flood-related damages on two (2) occasions during a ten (10) year
period, ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made,
in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or
exceeded twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the building at the
time of each such flood event.

§ 152.36  SPECIFIC STANDARDS.



   In all SFHAs, the following provisions are required:



   (A)   Building protection requirement.  In addition to the
requirements of § 152.35, all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be
protected from flood damage below the FPG. This building protection
requirement applies to the following situations:



      (1)   Construction or placement of any new structure having a
floor area greater than four hundred (400) square feet;



      (2)   Addition or improvement made to any existing structure:



         (a)   Where the cost of the addition or improvement
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the value of the existing structure
(excluding the value of the land);



         (b)   With a previous addition or improvement
constructed since the community's first floodplain ordinance.



      (3)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure
where the costs of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
(excluding the value of the land) before damage occurred;



      (4)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a
site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days;



      (5)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new

      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any
residential structure (or  manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, at or above the FPG (two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation).



      (2)   Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement
of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of §
152.36(D).



   (C)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or nonresidential structure (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to or above the FPG (two (2) feet above the base flood elevation). Structures
located in all “A Zones” may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated,
if done in accordance with the following:



      (1)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the structure has been designed so that, below the FPG, the
structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of
resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall
take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic
pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in § 152.27(J).



      (2)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.



   (D)   Elevated structures. 



      (1)   New construction or substantial improvements of elevated
structures,  including fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the flood protection grade, shall be designed to
preclude finished living space, and to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls.



      (2)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either
be certified by a professional engineer or architect, or meet the following
minimum criteria:



         (a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a
total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every one (1) square
foot of enclosed area; and



         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one (1) foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal in
elevation to, or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and



         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions; and



         (d)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door), or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and



         (e)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall
not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; and



         (f)   Portions of the building below the flood
protection grade must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.



   (E)   Structures constructed on fill.  A residential or
nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill, in
accordance with the following:



      (1)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one
(1) foot deep before compacting to ninety-five percent (95%) of the maximum
density obtainable with the Standard Proctor Test method;



      (2)   The fill should extend at least ten (10) feet beyond the
foundation of the structure before sloping below the FPG;



      (3)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour
during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or bulkheading. If vegetative
cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three (3) horizontal to
one (1) vertical;



      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface
drainage from or onto neighboring properties;

   (F)   Standards for structures constructed with a crawlspace.  A
residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace
located below the flood protection grade, provided that the following
conditions are met:



      (1)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to
resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
and



      (2)   Any enclosed area below the flood protection grade shall
have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Provide a minimum of two (2)
openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for
every one (1) square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of the openings shall
be no more than one (1) foot above grade; and



      (3)   The interior height of the crawlspace, measured from the
interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall, must not
exceed four (4) feet at any point; and



      (4)   Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated
above the flood protection grade; and



      (5)   An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable
period of time after a flood event; and



      (6)   Portions of the building below the flood protection
grade must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and



      (7)   The interior grade of the crawlspace must be at or above

   (G)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days must meet one
(1) of the following requirements:



      (1)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG, and
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all
manufactured homes to be placed on a site:



         (a)   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;



         (b)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

§ 152.38  CRITICAL FACILITIES.



   (A)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the
extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA.



   (B)   Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible
within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available.



      (1)   Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall
have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.



      (2)   Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to

(Ord. 2009-13, passed 8-27-09)



§ 152.39  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.



   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in § 152.07, are areas
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and
has erosion potential.



   (B)   If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain
Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along
with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.



      (1)   Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any
excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the
floodway.



      (2)   This includes land preparation activities, such as
filling, grading, clearing and paving, and the like, undertaken before the
actual start of construction of the structure.



      (3)   However, it does exclude non-substantial
additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary
river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial
additions/improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without
obtaining a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an
addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway
permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)



   (C)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
a permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources granting approval for construction in a floodway.



   (D)   Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued
by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator
may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions
contained in §§ 152.35 through 152.39 of this chapter have been met.



      (1)   The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources.



      (2)   However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if
any) shall take precedence.



   (E)   No development shall be allowed that, acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory
flood more than fourteen hundreds (0.14) of one (1) foot.



   (F)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees), the Town shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.

8-27-09)  Penalty, see § 152.99



§ 152.40  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.



   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the
provisions contained in §§ 152.35 through 152.39 of this chapter have been
met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or
substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.



(Ord. 2009-13, passed 8-27-09)



§ 152.41  STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS
AND/OR FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.



   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one (1)
square mile.



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the
drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one (1) square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.



      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until either a permit for construction in a floodway, or a floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the
recommended flood protection grade, has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.



      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the
proper permit for construction in a floodway or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
floodplain development permit may be issued; provided the conditions of the
floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and the provisions
contained in §§ 152.35 through 152.39 of this chapter have been met.



   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one (1) square
mile.



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the
drainage area upstream of the site is less than one (1) square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an
engineering analysis, showing the limits of the floodway, fringe and 100-year
flood elevation for the site.



      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in
§§through 152.39 of this chapter have been met.



   (C)   Total cumulative effect.  The total cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the regulatory flood more than fourteen
hundreds (0.14) of one (1) foot, and will not increase flood damages or
potential flood damages.

(Ord. 2009-13, passed 8-27-09)



§ 152.52  VARIANCE PROCEDURES.



   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:



   (A)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;



   (B)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;



   (C)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;



   (D)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;



   (E)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed

(Ord. 2009-13, passed 8-27-09)



§ 152.53  CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.



   (A)   Variances shall only be issued when there is:



      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; and



      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.



   (B)   No variance for a residential use within a floodway subject to
§ 152.39 or § 152.41(A) of this chapter may be granted.



   (C)   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to § 152.39 or §
152.41(A) of this chapter will require a permit from the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources.



   (D)   Variances to the provisions of § 152.36 may be granted only
when a new structure is to be located on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less
in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the flood protection grade.



   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.



   (F)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration
of any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.



   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation
and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built, and stating that
the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (see § 152.54).



   (H)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of
appeal actions and, upon request, shall report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(see § 152.54).

§ 152.54  VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.



   (A)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice, over the signature of a community official, that:



      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance, up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
and



      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.



   (B)   A copy of the notice shall by recorded by the Floodplain
Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder, and shall be recorded in
a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of
land.



   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.

§ 152.55  HISTORIC STRUCTURES.



   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures”, upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
“historic structure”, and the variance is the minimum to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.

Article
Article 1: Ordinance Foundation 1-03
Basic Provisions 1
H. Interpretation
1. Minimum Requirements: The provisions of the Unified Development Ordinance are the minimum requirements
necessary to achieve this ordinance's purpose.
2. Conflict or Inconsistency:
a. Internal: Unless otherwise specifically stated within the Unified Development Ordinance, if two (2) or
more provisions of the Unified Development Ordinance are in conflict or are inconsistent with one another,
then the most restrictive provision shall apply.
b. Federal, State, and Local:
i. Whenever a provision of the Unified Development Ordinance imposes a greater restriction or a higher
standard than is required by any State or Federal code or regulation, or other Town ordinance or
regulation, the provision of the Unified Development Ordinance shall apply.
ii. Whenever a provision of any State or Federal code or regulation, or other Town ordinance or regulation
imposes a greater restriction or a higher standard than is required by the Unified Development
Ordinance, the provision of the State or Federal code or regulation, or other Town ordinance or
regulation shall apply.
c. Other: Whenever a private covenant, contract, commitment, agreement, or other similar private land use
regulation imposes a greater restriction or a higher standard than is required by a provision of the Unified
Development Ordinance, the stricter standard would apply, albeit by a non-governmental regulation.
However, if a project complies with the Unified Development Ordinance, the town is still obligated to issue
the permit or otherwise approve the project.
3. Illustrations: If differences are found between the meaning or implication of any illustration or drawing, the
regulating text of the Unified Development Ordinance shall apply.

of the provisions shall apply.
5. Time Frames: Unless specifically noted otherwise, time frames stated within the Unified Development
Ordinance shall be calculated to include weekdays, weekends, and holidays. If a time frame ends on a
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday that the Town of Brownsburg offices are closed, the time frame will be extended
to the end of the next business day.
6. Delegation of Authority: If a provision in the Unified Development Ordinance requires the Zoning
Administrator or other Town officer to perform an act or duty, that provision shall also include any person
working under the authority and supervision of the Zoning Administrator unless specified otherwise.
7. Mandatory and Permissive Terms: The words “shall” or “must” are always mandatory. The words “may” or
“should” are always permissive.
8. Words Used: If words used in the Unified Development Ordinance are not defined in Article 11: Definitions,
they shall be construed to be the common usage of the language. Any legal or technical words not defined in
the Unified Development Ordinance shall be construed to be as defined by an appropriate lexicon or current
and common dictionary.
9. Tense: If words are used in a specific tense (i.e. past, future or present) it shall be construed to include all
tenses, unless the context clearly indicates a specific tense.
10. Singular/Plural Form: If words are used in singular form, the plural form shall apply and vice versa, unless the
context clearly indicates the contrary.
11. Gender: If a feminine term is used, the masculine shall also apply and vice versa.
12. Conjunctions: The word “and” shall be construed to include all connected items, conditions, and provisions in
a series, unless the context clearly suggests the contrary. The word “or” shall be construed to include one or
more of the items, conditions, and provisions in a series, unless the context clearly suggests the contrary.
13. Rounding: If a regulatory formula is used within the Unified Development Ordinance and results in a
non-whole number of an indivisible object or feature (i.e. a tree), the non-whole number shall be up rounded to
the next highest whole number.
14. Intent: Any section within the Unified Development Ordinance under an “intent” or “purpose” heading shall
not be binding regulation. Rather it is guidance for the reader to understand what the Town’s goals are for the

or a specific color noted on the map legend shall be used to identify the standard zoning districts on the map.
2. Overlay Districts: The overlay district boundaries shown on the Official Zoning Map shall be interpreted as
follows:
a. Labeling: An overlay district shall be noted on the Official Zoning Map with a hatch or textured pattern
and be noted as such on the map legend.
b. Fully Covered: A lot that is fully covered (bounded) by an overlay district shall be interpreted to be subject
to the overlay district standards found in Article 3: Overlay Districts.
c. Partially Covered: A lot that is partially covered (i.e. transected) by an overlay district boundary shall
be interpreted to be subject to the overlay district standards where the lot area is covered by the overlay
district.
3. Standards: Zoning district boundaries on the Official Zoning Map shall be interpreted as follows:
a. Streets: Zoning district boundaries shown within or parallel to the lines of streets, easements, and
transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the centerline of the affected street, easement, or
right‑of‑way.
b. Section Lines: Zoning district boundaries indicated as following or being parallel to section lines, fractional
sectional lines, or platted lot lines shall be construed as following or paralleling such lines.
c. Water: Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers or
other moving bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
d. Vacated: Whenever any street, alley, public way, railroad right‑of‑way, waterway, or other similar area
is vacated by proper authority, the zoning districts adjoining each side of vacated areas shall be extended
automatically to the center of the vacated area. All areas included in the vacation shall thereafter be subject
to all regulations of the extended zoning districts. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining zoning
district, or zoning district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended automatically to include all of
the vacated area.
4. Disputes: Any dispute about an exact zoning district boundary shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may refuse to make a determination when he/she cannot definitely
determine the location of a zoning district boundary. The Plan Commission may then interpret the location of
the zoning district boundary with reference to the scale of the Official Zoning Map and the purposes set forth in
all relevant provisions of the Unified Development Ordinance.
D. Regular Revisions: The Official Zoning Map shall be formally revised by the Plan Commission as changes are
made (e.g. rezonings, planned developments, or annexations) or as the Zoning Administrator determines necessary.
During the time it takes for each revision to be made electronically, hand drawn lines and text on a printout of the
previous Official Zoning Map will be appropriate to note official changes. Revisions may be made at any time to
correct drafting errors, clerical errors or omissions in the Official Zoning Map.
E. Copies: Print copies of the Official Zoning Map may be distributed. Each copy of the Official Zoning Map shall be
accurate only to the date on which it was last modified. The date of the latest revision shall be printed on copies of
the Official Zoning Map.
F. Damage, Destruction, or Loss: In the event the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult
to interpret, the Plan Commission may prepare a new map which shall depict the Official Zoning Map as best as
possible, and shall thereafter supersede the damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret map. The new map
shall be adopted by resolution of the Plan Commission and shall thereafter be the Official Zoning Map.

5.38 LA-01: Landscaping Standards
This Landscaping Standards (LA) section applies to the following zoning districts:
The following standards apply:
A. Cross Reference: See Fence and Wall Standards (FW) for other elements related to landscaping.
B. General Provision:
1. Applicability: Detached single-family residences, except subdivisions, and accessory buildings shall be exempt
from the landscaping standards.
2. Exemptions: The requirements of the landscaping standards shall not apply to the following:

c. Unplatted parcels of land being developed for:
i. Institutional uses.
ii. The process of subdividing property for the purpose of creating streets and extending utilities.
iii. Other residential developments that require a final site plan, special exception use or site plan review.
3. Enforcement: Wherever a site plan review is required, a landscape plan shall be a required part of such site
plan. A certificate of occupancy may be issued for the building for a period of one (1) year when weather
conditions do not permit landscape installation. Failure to implement the approved landscape plan, including
preservation of existing features, or to maintain the landscaping as long as incompatibility of adjoining uses
exists, shall be a violation of this section.
4. Content of Landscape Plan: A landscape plan shall conform to the following requirements:
a. A landscape plan is required for residential subdivisions and for individual non-residential lots. It is
recommended that the landscape plan be prepared by a licensed landscape architect, nurseryman, or other
professional experienced in landscape design and the installation and care of plant materials.
b. All landscape plans submitted for approval as a component of a required site plan shall show the entire
lot to scale, on standard sized sheets (minimum 24 inches by 36 inches), and shall contain the following
information:
i. The name and address of the owner, developer, and plan preparer, the date the plan was prepared,
scale, and north arrow;
ii. The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, parking lots and driveways,
roadways and right-of-ways, sidewalks and other designated pedestrian or bicycle pathways, ground
signs, refuse disposal areas, bicycle parking areas, freestanding electrical equipment, recreation facilities,
utility lines and easements, freestanding structural features, and other landscape improvements,
such as earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, and courts or
paved areas;
iii. The location, quantity, size, and common name of all proposed planting materials;
iv. The location, size and common name of an existing individual stand alone tree with a caliper of ten
(10) inches or greater, areas of dense trees or shrubs, and other natural areas which are to be preserved
and used in the calculation to determine compliance with this section;
v. The approximate location of existing structures and generic identification of plant materials within
twenty-five (25) feet of the property line of adjoining properties;
vi. Existing and proposed grading of the site, including proposed berming, indicating contours at not more
than two (2) foot intervals;
vii. Specification of the type and boundaries of all proposed vegetative ground cover;

xii. A table clearly displaying the relevant statistical information including the number of existing trees,
number of trees preserved, and the like, necessary for the Administrator to evaluate compliance with
the provisions of this section.
5. Modifications:
a. The Administrator may approve any landscape proposal that it deems to be equivalent to the foregoing
minimum requirements. No such approval shall have the effect of reducing the required setbacks or
reducing the landscaping requirements for any particular setbacks, buffer or parking area.
b. When a change in use or improvements or repairs of an existing structure occurs, the amount of landscaping
required will be directly proportional to the percentage of improvements or repairs. The Administrator
may approve a proposed landscape plan that is equal to or greater than the landscaping requirements in this
section.
6. Unit Value Standards:
Unit Value Landscaping and Buffer Yard Landscape Materials
Landscape Materials Categories - Minimum Size at Time of Planting Unit Value
Deciduous Shade Tree (Overstory) (2½ inch caliper) 0.75
Evergreen Tree (9 feet tall) 0.75
Deciduous Ornamental Tree (Understory) (1½ inch caliper) 0.50
Evergreen Tree (6 feet tall) 0.50
Evergreen Shrub-Narrow Spread (4 feet tall) 0.25
Hedge Plant (deciduous) (24 to 30 inches tall) 0.10
Hedge Plant (evergreen) (24 to 30 inches tall) 0.15
* Earthen Mound (3 feet tall) 0.50
* Earthen Mound (6 feet tall) 1.00
* Earthen Mound (9 feet tall) 2.00
*Note: In no case when using an Earthen Mound, can the value of plant material used on the mound be less than 2.
C. Preservation and Replacement of Trees:
1. Purpose and Intent: It is the intent of this section to ensure that developers take reasonable measures to design
and locate the proposed improvements so that the number of trees to be removed is minimized.
2. Preservation: To the greatest extent possible, existing trees shall be saved upon development of a property
unless it can be demonstrated that site design restrictions necessitate their removal.
3. Tree Inventory: Prior to the approval of the development and the issuance of an improvement location permit,
the developer shall inventory trees on the site which have a caliper of ten (10) inches or greater, following the
“American Standard for Nursery Stock” standards that are intended to be saved. The inventory shall contain
the location, size, and common name of an existing stand-alone tree, areas of dense trees or shrubs, and other
natural features. Existing trees saved in the development of the site shall be credited toward required landscaping
requirements based on the size of the preserved trees. Trees on the site may be removed only after the
inventory has been submitted and an improvement location permit obtained.
4. Preservation Principles: The determination of which trees shall be saved shall be guided by the following
principles:
a. The practicability of arranging site plan components around existing features. In general, plans for groups
of structures should be designed so as to preserve tree masses, individual tree specimens, and small stands
of trees and shrubs.
b. The condition of the vegetation with respect to continued vitality.
c. The practical and economic possibility of designing the location and grades of proposed structures and
paving to preserve existing vegetation.
d. The desirability or lack thereof of a particular tree or species by reason of its appearance, historic or
ecological significance, botanical characteristics, and the function the vegetation would fulfill as a site plan
component.
e. The potential for interference with utility services or with passage or visibility along streets or walkways.
f. The possibility of preserving the vegetation while meeting the development needs through pruning rather
than removal.
Town of Brownsburg Unified Development Ordinance
Article
5-30
Landscaping Standards (LA) 5
5. Tree Preservation Credits: Existing trees that are preserved will contribute to the required on-site landscaping,
based on individual tree types. For each shade tree that is preserved, which is greater than ten (10) inches in
caliper and is found on the approved list, the amount of new shade trees to be installed shall be reduced by
two (2) trees. Shrubbery will be evaluated in the same manner as new shrubbery based on the species. Such
credit shall apply only to the required landscaping for the specific buffer yard, parking lot, commercial strip, or
residential plot in which the existing vegetation is located.
6. Tree Protection: Barriers will be used to protect trees during the development of the site. Substantial barriers
shall be specified on the landscape plan and shall be placed at or beyond the dripline of trees to be protected.
These barriers shall remain in place during heavy construction on the site and no vehicles, machinery, tools,
chemicals, construction materials, or temporary soil deposits may be permitted within the barriers, nor may any
notice or other object be nailed or stapled to protected trees.
D. Selection, Installation, and Maintenance of Plant Materials:
1. Selection:
a. Artificial plants are prohibited. All plant materials used shall be living plants and shall be in conformance
with the provisions of this section, the standards of the American Association of Nurserymen, and shall
have passed any inspections required under local state regulations.
b. Planting materials used in conformance with the provisions of this section shall be of good quality, a
species hardy to central Indiana, pest and disease free, and capable of withstanding the extremes of
individual site microclimates.
c. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria which
shall be considered when selecting plant materials. At their time of planting and maturity, plants should
comply with the vision clearance standards.
d. Selection of plant material should be based on the year round interest (i.e. color, spring flower, fruits or
branching patterns) as well as form, texture and shape.
e. All shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two and one-half (2½) inches in caliper, unless
otherwise specified. The removal of trees within the public right-of-way is prohibited without the approval
of the Administrator.
f. All shrubs shall have a minimum height of eighteen (18) inches at planting, unless specified elsewhere in
this section, so they do not interfere with vision clearance standards.
g. Yards shall be landscaped primarily with turf or other plant materials. Pavement of yards other than for
parking and loading purposes is prohibited.
h. The tables of materials included in this section are classified by type. Trees are grouped into three (3)
categories: shade trees, ornamental trees, and evergreens. Shrubs are grouped by height: small shrubs
(less than two (2) feet), medium shrubs (two (2) to six (6) feet), and large shrubs (greater than six (6) feet).
Plant materials not listed on the tables will be assigned a classification based on height, spread, and/or
crown at maturity, using the best available resources to determine mature characteristics.
2. Installation:
a. All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with the current planting procedures established
by the American Association of Nurseryman.
b. All required landscaping of a development project shall be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy may be issued when the landscaping was not able to be
completed because of any of the following:
i. Periods of adverse weather.
ii. Conflicts between construction scheduling and proper planting seasons.
iii. For other similar conditions.
Article
Article 5: Development Standards 5-31
Landscaping Standards (LA) 5
c. A certificate of occupancy granted due to incomplete landscaping shall require:
i. Granting of temporary access to the town for completion of the landscaping.
ii. An irrevocable letter of credit, certified check, or performance bond payable to the town, a dualobligee
rider on an existing performance bond or escrow account with the project’s lending institution
or a combination of such methods.
iii. The amount shall be equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated installation cost of
all uncompleted landscaping, including a one (1) year guaranty cost, as determined by a landscape
architect, commercial landscape nursery, or commercial landscape contractor and deemed reasonable
by the Administrator. Written assurance and detailed itemization containing:
[a] Material, types, quantities, and unit prices of all improvements yet to be completed.
[b] An assurance that all such landscaping will be completed within a specified time period
satisfactory to the Administrator, but
[c] In no event longer than six (6) months from the date of occupancy.
iv. If the installation is not completed within the next growing season, or another agreed upon, specified
time period, the security shall be used by the town to complete the installation.
v. Upon completion of the installation by the town, any portion of the security deposit remaining after
payment of the cost of the installation, and the town’s total personnel, administrative, legal, and other
costs, shall be returned to the applicant.
3. Maintenance:
a. All newly planted vegetative material shall be guaranteed to meet minimum “American Standard for
Nursery Stock” standards at the time of planting and for three (3) year thereafter.
b. The property owner of record, the property owner’s agent or tenant or a homeowner’s association which
has assumed landscape maintenance responsibility shall keep all landscaping in a well maintained and
healthy growing condition. This means taking the following actions as needed:
i. Irrigating, weeding, fertilizing, pruning, mowing and other maintenance for all outside plant materials
in the property.
ii. Mature trees may not be topped. Instead, they may be pruned according to the procedures established
in the National Arborist Association Standards published by the National Arborist Association.
iii. Treating plant materials that exhibit evidence of insect pest or disease damage.
iv. Replacing dead or dying plant materials with specimens in good and healthy growing condition.
Replacement shall be with the same or alternate plant materials that enable the property to achieve or
maintain compliance with the provisions of this section.
v. Replacing dead plant materials within one (1) year. If adverse weather (e.g. winter) conditions prevent

Landscaping Standards (LA) 5
E. Landscape Design Standards: All development subject to Section 5.38(B):General Standards shall include the
following types of landscaping and buffering:
1. On-site.
2. Street frontage.
3. Buffer yard.
4. Parking area:
a. Interior parking lot landscaping.
b. Perimeter parking lot landscaping.
5. Scale and Nature of Landscaping: The scale and nature of landscaping materials shall be appropriate to the
size of the structures. Large scaled buildings, for example, should generally be complemented by larger scaled
plants. Plant materials shall be selected for their form, texture, color, pattern of growth and adaptability to local
conditions.
6. Clearance: Trees shall be planted or preserved so that when they reach maturity, there will be a minimum
ten-foot clearance between the tree trunk and structures, building overhangs, walls, fences and other trees.
7. Materials: Grass and other vegetative ground cover shall be used for all green space areas, including parking
lot islands, except for decorative mulch planting beds containing trees and/or shrubs and inert stabilization in
areas subject to severe runoff, erosion or ponding.
8. Vision Clearance Areas: Landscaping in landscaped areas shall not obstruct the sight lines between the street
and the access drives and parking aisles near the entries and exits in accordance with the standards provided for
in the vision clearance standards. Landscaping shall not be located where it creates an obstruction of view in
the radius of any curb return. See Vision Clearance Standards (VC).
9. Energy Conservation: Plantings shall be arranged to promote energy conservation wherever practical. This
includes using deciduous trees on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun
and planting evergreens on the north of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
10. Noise Reduction.
a. Properties next to noisy streets or businesses shall arrange landscaping to reduce the intensity of noise
by reflecting, deflecting and absorbing sound. Some techniques to accomplish this include using earth
berms, walls and fences to provide a physical separation in combination with deciduous or evergreen trees
to absorb the noise. A noise reduction fence shall not exceed six (6) feet in height. Any additional height
requirement shall be accommodated by using earthen mounds.
b. Where stone or other inert materials are to be used for ground cover, they shall be specifically identified on
the landscape plan. Any area not so designated shall be required to have grass or ground cover.
11. Trash and Loading Facilities: All trash dumpsters, trash pads, loading areas consisting of two (2) or more
loading spaces, loading docks, and service and maintenance areas shall be screened from other residential uses
or zoning districts and all adjacent public streets. Such screening may be achieved by using a six-foot (6') high,
completely opaque fence or wall, a six-foot (6') high berm, or a six-foot (6') high evergreen screen planted nine
(9) feet on center in a double staggered row.
12. Heating and Cooling Facilities: Ground-mounted heating and cooling units for nonresidential or multi-family
structures shall be adequately screened by landscaping so as not to be visible from streets and/or adjacent
properties.
13. Softening of Walls and Fences: Plant materials shall be placed intermittently against long expanses of building
walls, fences and other barriers to create a softening effect.
14. Detention/Retention Basins and Ponds: Detention/retention basins and ponds shall be landscaped and are
encouraged to be shaped to replicate a natural form of a pond. Such landscaping should include shade and
ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubbery, hedges, and/or other plant materials.
15. Screening Requirements for Wireless Communications Facilities: The communications tower base and all
accessory equipment shall be enclosed by a security fence of at least six (6) feet in height with an access gate
that remains locked except when attended by authorized personnel. In addition, the enclosure shall be screened
on all sides, and both the fence and screening shall meet the following provisions:
a. The security fence shall be opaque and shall be of colors that are compatible with the natural and built
environments.
b. The screen shall be of dense evergreen plant material with a mature height of at least six (6) feet.

16. Service Structures: Any new development is encouraged to be served by underground utilities such as electricity,
cable, etc., where feasible. Any service structure that can be seen from the first floor of a residence or from
any street shall be screened. Structures may be grouped together; however, screening height requirements
shall be based upon the tallest of the structures. Service structures shall include, but are not limited to: loading
docks, propane tanks, dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults which extend above ground, ground
mounted utility equipment and any electrical or other equipment or elements providing service to a building or
a site. All service structures shall not be visible from adjacent residential developments or public right-of-way.
17. Other Site Elements: Site elements such as outdoor lighting, signage, trash receptacles and fencing should be
considered integral parts of the landscaped plans. The end result should be one, which incorporates a pleasing
appearance from both on and off the site.
18. Curbing: Concrete or similar curbing should be installed around all landscape areas to continue landscape
material and to provide protection from vehicles. Alternatively, recessed planting areas may be used to capture
and filter surface water. If recessed, stop blocks shall be used. Also, if recessed, plant material shall be
selected to function as a rain garden, or similar vegetated infiltration practice.
F. On-site and Street Frontage Landscaping Standards
1. On-site standards.
a. Yards, setbacks and other green space areas within the development shall be landscaped with live vegetation.
The minimum number of trees to be planted on each lot and common open space areas is a function
of the number of dwelling units or square footage of non-residential buildings. The number of plants
required on a site is determined by the use. The following table specifies the minimum tree requirements:

6. Lighting:
a. If parking lots are illuminated, the light fixtures and poles shall be consistent in color, size, height, and design.
b. Parking lot lights shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in height, measured from the bottom of the fixture
to the ground.
c. Parking lot lights shall meet all standards in Lighting Standards (LT).
7. Connectivity:
a. Connectivity to adjacent parking lots shall be required in at least one (1) location. This may be accomplished
through an aisle connector, frontage street, access street, or stub to an adjacent lot zoned for
commercial, institutional, or industrial use. The Zoning Administrator may waive this requirement when:
i. pre-existing development will not feasibly allow such a connection,
ii. topography will not feasibly allow such a connection,
iii. the resulting connection would create a pedestrian or vehicular hazard, or
iv. the neighboring use would be a conflict with the proposed use on the subject lot.
b. Cross-access Easements:
i. Where parking lots connect or are laid out to be connected, a cross-access easement shall be established.
ii. Cross-access easements shall not be less than ten (10) feet in width per lane nor exceed twelve (12)
feet in width per lane.
8. Cart Corrals: Cart corrals shall be required for all retail businesses with more than twenty-thousand (20,000)
square feet of retail space; that provide shopping carts or the like to customers; and that allow those carts to
leave the building. Cart corrals shall be maintained in good condition.
a. Design: Cart corrals shall be made of permanent materials on all three (3) sides creating an enclosure, and
shall be anchored to the parking lot surface. Cart corrals shall be constructed using one of the following
material options:
i. Decorative metal railing at least thirty-six (36) inches in height with curbed landscape area on all three
(3) sides. The landscape area shall be a minimum of three (3) feet in width and contain a minimum of
one (1) shrub per four (4) feet of landscaping bed.
ii. Brick masonry walls at least thirty-six (36) inches in height on all three (3) sides. The materials used
in the brick masonry wall shall complement the architecture of the principal structure. Bricks used in
the masonry wall shall not exceed five (5) inches by five (5) inches by ten (10) inches in size.
b. Maximum Size: Cart containment area shall not exceed ten (10) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in length.
c. Cumulative Containment: All cart corrals in combination shall be able to accommodate at least fifty
percent (50%) of the fleet of shopping carts available.
9. Reduced Parking Lot Area Standards: A parking lot may be built with fewer spaces than the required minimum
of vehicular spaces identified in Table PK-A: Minimum Number of Parking Spaces Per Use if the following
standards are met.
a. Adequate and appropriate space shall be land-banked such that the full number of parking spaces required
in Table PK-A: Minimum Number of Parking Spaces Per Use can be built on-site at a later date, should the
need arise.
b. The property owner shall record a site plan that clearly denotes the land-banked area, and that identifies the
area as a “no-build area.” The no-build area shall only allow landscaping material and shall restrict any
septic system, structure, foundation, change in topography, or any other permanent or temporary structure
or alteration that would make it cost prohibitive or difficult to develop parking on that area in the future.
c. A design for a parking lot that accommodates all the required parking spaces and that abides by the on-site
drainage standards shall be submitted for review. The reduced parking lot shall be a portion of the full
parking lot. The full and partial parking lot designs shall be concurrently subject to the same review
process necessary to meet the applicable requirements of the Unified Development Ordinance. If both
designs are approved, the smaller parking lot design may be constructed and the full parking lot design
shall be recorded.
d. Under no circumstances may the smaller parking lot design establish less than forty percent (40%) of the
required parking spaces in Table PK-A: Minimum Number of Parking Spaces Per Use.
e. If the smaller parking lot is periodically full, the additional parking shall be required to be constructed.
Evidence of employees or guests parking on the grass or on-street shall constitute a violation.

regulated using the front yard setback, side yard setback, and rear yard setback standards that were in place at the
time of platting.

rear yard setback, for primary or accessory structures, to utilize established setback standards in special circumstances
(e.g. a historic and narrow lot being used for infill development). Specifically, an established setback may
be permitted when the result of applying the applicable setbacks for the subject lot would result in discontinuity
with adjacent properties in the same zoning classification; or would substantially constrain development opportunity
on the lot in a way inconsistent with adjacent properties within the same zoning classification. The Zoning
Administrator may reject requests to utilize established setbacks if the proposed architecture, massing, or building
form is inconsistent with the adjacent architecture.

Sewer and Water Standards (SW) 5
5.64 SW-01: Sewer and Water Standards
This Sewer and Water Standards (SW) section applies to the following zoning districts:
The following standards apply:
A. Applicability: If the below listed sewer and water standard does not appear on the two-page layout for a zoning
district, then it does not apply to that particular zoning district.
1. Sewer: Connection to a sanitary sewer utility shall be per each two-page layout in Article 2: Zoning Districts.
Details about the terminology on the two-page layouts is as follows.
a. Required: The term “required” shall mean a connection to the Town of Brownsburg municipal sanitary
sewer system, or other utility providing said service, shall be required.
b. Required When Available: The term “required when available” with or without a multiplier shall mean
a connection to the Town of Brownsburg municipal sanitary sewer system, or other utility providing said
service, shall be required except as otherwise provided for under Section 52.02(G) in the Town Code, or is
within cost basis within the multiplier listed. The multiplier rule is described below.
c. Multiplier Rule: The following describes the multiplier rule for sewage treatment:
i. On-site System Cost: Get an estimate for installing an on-site system (e.g. septic system), or repairing
or replacing an existing on-site system, as applicable, meeting all health department requirements.
ii. Off-site Connection Cost: Get an estimate to connect to the nearest (or lesser cost option if it is not the
nearest) public or private utility with adequate capacity. The estimate should include materials, labor,
equipment, and tap-in fees for the installation of a sewer connection to a public or private utility (e.g.
availability fees charged by the Town and cost recovery fees), including, any costs associated with
the required abandonment of the existing septic system. A single, legitimate bid from a reputable and
qualified contractor shall be sufficient. When a sewer line is a significant distance away or for another
technical reason is clearly many times more expensive, a simple letter from a reputable and qualified
contractor or civil engineer describing why the cost would be well in excess of the multiplier rule will
suffice. Additionally, the Zoning Administrator may recognize in writing that connecting to a sewer
line would be well in excess of the multiplier rule and waive the requirement for the calculations to be
conducted or a letter be submitted.
iii. Determining the Requirement: Multiply the cost of installing an on-site system (e.g. septic system)
by the assigned multiplier. If the cost of connecting to the public or private utility is less, then the
improvement is required to connect to the utility’s lines. If the cost of connecting to a public or private
utility is more than the multiplied cost of installing an on-site system, then an on-site system meeting
all health department requirements may be installed.
iv. Multiple Dwelling Units: For developments with two or more lots, dwelling units, or primary structures,
the cumulative cost of installing on-site systems for each lot, dwelling unit, or primary structure
shall be used in comparison to connecting the entire project to a private or public utility.
d. Subsidy: The Town of Brownsburg or a utility company may bridge the financial gap on a project when
the property owner is not required to connect to the utility using the multiplier rule. The financial contribution
only needs to lower the cost of the connection to a utility to an amount that makes the project cost fall
within the multiplier rule.
2. Water: Connection to a water utility shall be per each two-page layout in Article 2: Zoning Districts. Details
about the terminology on the two-page layouts is as follows.
a. Required: When water is stated as “required” a connection to the Town of Brownsburg municipal water
system, or other utility providing said service, shall be required.

Wind Turbine System Standards (WT) 5
I. Location Restrictions:
1. Setback from Property Line: A large wind turbine system shall be a minimum of 100 feet or 200% of the hub
height from the property line, whichever is greater.
2. Setback from On-site Buildings: A large wind turbine system shall be required to be setback 100 feet from any
on-site primary building. There is no required setback from accessory structures.
3. Setback from Off-site Land Uses: A large wind turbine system shall be a minimum of 1,000 feet from a platted
residential subdivision, multiple-family residential development, institutional use (e.g. school or church), land
zoned single-family residential, land zoned multiple-residential, or land zoned institutional. These standards
only apply to off-site properties and should not be construed as restricting any of the above listed types of
development (e.g. school or multiple-family development) from choosing to have an on-site large wind turbine
system.
4. Setback from Airport or Heliport: A large wind turbine system shall be a minimum of 2,500 feet from an
airport or heliport.
5. Setback from Utilities: A large wind turbine system shall be a minimum of 200 feet or 200% of the hub height
from above ground transmission lines, utility lines, or substations, whichever is greater.
J. Safety:
1. Ground Clearance: The rotors (i.e. blades) of a horizontal axis large wind turbine system mounted on a tower
shall not extend vertically to within thirty (30) feet of the ground.
2. Anti-icing Technology: A large wind turbine system shall be equipped with technology able to detect icing on
rotors that causes the system to shut down when experiencing a significant icing event; or shall utilize another
industry accepted standard for protecting against shedding of significant pieces of ice capable of damaging
nearby buildings and/or injuring persons or animals on the ground.
3. Controls and Brakes: A large wind turbine system shall be equipped with a redundant braking system that
includes both aerodynamic overspeed controls (i.e. variable pitch, tip, and other similar systems) and mechanical
brakes.
K. Nuisance Prevention:
1. Noise: A large wind turbine system shall not generate more than 40dBA L90 or ambient dBA L90 + 5dBA,
whichever is greater when measured at the property line.
2. Illumination: A large wind turbine system shall not be illuminated in any way unless required by or Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations shall be
demonstrated to the Zoning Administrator prior to installation. If signal lighting is required on the top of a
large wind turbine system, then it shall be shielded to prevent light below the horizontal plain.
3. Shadow Flicker: The flickering effect caused by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) required signal
light and the turning of the rotor shall be mitigated to the extent possible with the best known technology or
practice.
4. Color: A large wind turbine system shall be a non-obtrusive color such as white, off-white, gray, earth tones, or
similar non-reflective colors.
5. Signs: No large wind turbine system shall be used to display a commercial message.
6. Signal Interference: The owner shall make reasonable efforts to avoid any disruption or loss of radio,
telephone, television or similar signals, and shall mitigate any harm caused by the large wind turbine system.
7. Feeder Lines: Feeder lines for wind turbines (i.e. electrical connection between the wind turbine and the
on-site structure in which the power is utilized) shall be placed underground.
L. Abandoned Systems: A large wind turbine system shall be considered abandoned if its use as a wind turbine system
is discontinued for more than six (6) months. The large wind turbine system shall be removed within nine (9)
months after being abandoned.
M. Appurtenances: A large wind turbine system shall not have any appurtenances (e.g. exterior lighting, wireless
communication antennae, or ornamentation). Weather monitoring devices and safety equipment shall not be
considered appurtenances.

Design Standards - Introduction 7
7.01 Using this Section
The following pages, Article 7: Design Standards, contains the design standards that apply to new subdivisions, and
which are arranged by category. There are two ways to determine which design standards apply to a specific subdivision
type. They are:
A. Using Two-Page Layouts: Refer to the two-page layouts in Article 6: Subdivision Types for a specific subdivision
type. In the “Additional Design Standards that Apply” box for that specific subdivision type are listed four-digit
codes that indicate which design standards apply. Only the four-digit codes noted in the “Additional Design
Standards that Apply” section apply to that subdivision type.
[As an example, on page 6-11, the four digit code “MX-01” can be found under the “Additional Design Standards
that Apply” section for a Traditional Subdivision (TD). Therefore, the Design Standards in the section labeled
“MX-01” (on page 7-27) would apply to any Traditional Subdivision (TD).]
B. Using Icons: Refer to the icons used at the top of each design standard section in Article 7: Design Standards.
Each design standard section begins with a four-digit code and introductory sentence followed by square icons with
development type abbreviations (e.g. ST for Standard Subdivisions or PD for Planned Unit Developments). These
development type icons note that the design standards written in that section apply to that development type.
[As an example, on page 7-08, the CN icon ( ) can be found under the DN-01 design standard section. Therefore
the language in the DN-01 section would apply to Conservation Subdivisions.]

Architectural Diversity Standards (AD) 7
7.03 AD-01: Curvilinear Subdivision Architectural Diversity (AD) Standards
This Architectural Diversity Standards (AD) section applies to the following types of development:
A. Applicability: Any residential subdivision with internal streets shall comply with the regulations in this section.
B. Floor Plan Duplication Restriction: No two adjacent primary structures shall have the same floor plan. The
illustration below highlights the lots considered adjacent. Additionally, at least thirty percent (30%) of all floor
plans used shall be unique in any residential development. Mirror images of the subject lot’s floor plan or minor
alterations to the floor plan shall not constitute a unique floor plan. Lots behind the subject lot shall not be considered
adjacent, thus, not subject to the Floor Plan Duplication Restriction standards.

C. Front Elevation: A primary structure within one lot of the subject lot has the same floor plan or a mirror image
floor plan shall not have the same front elevation design. The facade materials, architectural treatments, garage
orientation, and/or roof design shall be different such that the cumulative result is a unique facade. Brick color
change, paint color change, or minor alterations to the floor plan shall not constitute a unique front elevation. The
illustration below highlights the lots that cannot have the same front elevation. Note that Section 7.03(B): Floor
Plan Duplication Restriction does not allow adjacent lots to have the same floor plan, even if the facade is notably
different. Lots behind the subject lot shall not be considered adjacent, thus, not subject to the Front Elevation
standards.

B. Floor Plan Duplication Restriction: No two adjacent primary structures shall have the same floor plan. The
illustration below highlights the lots considered adjacent. Additionally, at least six (6) unique floor plans shall be
used in any residential development. Mirror images of the subject lot’s floor plan or minor alterations to the floor
plan shall not constitute a unique floor plan. Lots behind the subject lot shall not be considered adjacent, thus, not

C. Front Elevation: If a primary structure within two (2) lots of the subject lot has the same floor plan it shall not
have the same front elevation design. The facade materials, architectural treatments, garage orientation, and/or
roof design shall be notably different. Mirror images of the subject lot’s floor plan, brick color change, paint color
change, or minor alterations to the floor plan shall not constitute a unique front elevation, but are encouraged to
further create a non-duplicative look. The illustration below highlights the lots that cannot have the same front
elevation. Note that Section 7.04(B): Floor Plan Duplication Restriction does not allow adjacent lots to have the
same floor plan, even if the facade is notably different. Lots behind the subject lot shall not be considered adjacent,
thus, not subject to the Front Elevation standards.

1. Large Townhouse Developments: At least six (6) unique floor plans shall be used throughout any townhouse
development with six (6) or more multiple-unit buildings (i.e. “large townhouse development”). Mirror images
of a floor plan or minor alterations to a floor plan shall not constitute a unique floor plan.
2. Small Townhouse Developments: At least four (4) unique floor plans shall be used throughout any townhouse
development with less than six (6) multiple-unit buildings (i.e. “small townhouse development”). Mirror
images of a floor plan or minor alterations to a floor plan shall not constitute a unique floor plan.
C. Primary Elevations: Townhouse developments shall have diversity in at least three elevations such to avoid a
“cookie cutter” or repetitive aesthetic throughout the development. Diversity in elevations may be from building to
building and/or from architectural delineation of each dwelling unit’s facade. Diversity shall be achieved through
use of architectural features, siding material changes, brick color changes, paint color changes, entryway feature
changes, window variations, and/or roof design.
1. Large Townhouse Developments: No more than forty percent (40%) of all multiple-unit building’s facade
designs shall be substantially identical throughout any townhouse development with six (6) or more multipleunit
buildings. A combination of color pallet changes, facade material changes, roof design changes, window
sizes and location changes, and/or architectural detail changes, may be sufficient to be considered a unique
facade when the overall aesthetic is notably different. Therefore, each building may have the same set of floor
plans if the exterior character is deemed sufficiently different by the Zoning Administrator.
2. Small Townhouse Developments: No more than fifty-five percent (55%) of all multiple-unit building’s facade
designs shall be substantially identical throughout any townhouse development with less than six (6) multipleunit
buildings. A combination of color pallet changes, facade material changes, roof design changes, window
sizes and location changes, and/or architectural detail changes, may be sufficient to be considered a unique
facade when the overall aesthetic is notably different. Therefore, each building may have the same set of floor
plans if the exterior character is deemed sufficiently different by the Zoning Administrator.

7.13 FH-01: Flood Hazard Standards
This Flood Hazard Standards (FH) section applies to the following types of development:
A. Cross Reference: All proposed subdivisions, planned developments, and development plans shall be in compliance
with Town of Brownsburg Flood Hazard Ordinance, Chapter 152 in the Town’s Municipal Code.
B. Denoting Base Flood Elevation:
1. Development Partially Within Special Flood Hazard Areas: The base flood elevation (BFE) shall be identified
on all secondary plats and on all plot plans that are partially within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
2. Larger Developments: Base flood elevation data shall be provided for proposed subdivisions, planned developments,
and development plans encompassing either five (5) or more acres or fifty (50) or more lots.
3. Language on Plats and Plot Plans: A note to developers, builders and future property owners shall be added
to the secondary plat and each plot plan (i.e. each lot’s as-built survey document), indicating that the base flood
elevation (BFE) is not an indicator of the maximum flood elevation and that improvements should be kept as
far and high above the base flood elevation (BFE) as practical. The specific language that shall be placed on
the development’s plat and each affected plot plan is as follows:
“This [subdivision/plot plan] is partially in a flood hazard area which is delineated by a line labeled Base
Flood Elevation. The area within the flood hazard area is shaded on the [plat/plot plan] and labeled Flood
Hazard Area. This area represents land that is prone to flooding now or in the future. This delineation is NOT
a guarantee for maximum flood elevation during an act of nature. Rather it is a calculated elevation that has
the highest risk of flooding during a major storm event. Therefore, all permanent and temporary structures
should be located as far away from the Base Flood Elevation line and constructed as high as practical above
the ground.”
C. Designed to Minimize Flood Damage: All proposed subdivisions, planned developments, and development plans
shall be designed to minimize flood damage to public improvements, including having streets, sidewalks, multi-use
paths, unimproved path, and public utilities (e.g. sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems) located and constructed
to minimize flood damage.
D. Flood Event Plan: Prior to secondary plat approval, subdivisions located partially within a Special Flood Hazard
Area (SFHA) identified as an “A Zone” on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps shall prepare a “flood event plan” for
any lots that would potentially lose access to a perimeter street during a flood event. The flood event plan shall
address:
1. Street Closure: How streets can be temporarily closed,
2. Stranded Cars: Where cars can park on-street when accessibility is lost,
3. Emergency Vehicles: Where emergency vehicles can stage evacuation or rescue operations, and
4. Life Safety: How life safety can be protected.
The rescue and evacuation plan components shall be approved by the Plan Commission and then filed with the
appropriate community emergency management authorities.

Pedestrian Network Standards (PN) 7
7.28 PN-01: Pedestrian Network Standards
This Pedestrian Network Standards (PN) section applies to the following types of development:
A. Cross Reference: Sidewalks and multi-use paths shall be constructed to meet or exceed the Town of Brownsburg
Construction Standards.
B. Applicability: Any developments with internal streets shall have sidewalks along those streets. All developments
with frontage along a public street (i.e. perimeter street) shall install a multi-use path or sidewalk from side
property line to side property line. The use of a sidewalk or multi-use path shall be determined by Brownsburg
Comprehensive Plan, or the Zoning Administrator if not specifically called out in the plan.
C. Required Pedestrian Facilities: Sidewalks Along Internal Streets: The two-page layout for the applicable subdivision
type in Article 6: Subdivision Types shall determine the sidewalk material, how many sides of the street
sidewalks are required, where in the right-of-way the sidewalk shall be located, the sidewalk’s width, and whether a
tree lawn is required between the street and sidewalk. The following are additional standards that apply to internal
street sidewalks.
a. Crossings: Sidewalks shall be designed to cross street intersections safely to sidewalks on the opposite
side of the street.
b. ADA Compliance: Sidewalks at street intersections shall have ADA compliant ramps.
c. Free of Obstacles: All sidewalks shall be free of obstacles, including overhead and adjacent to the
sidewalk. Overhead clearance shall be seven (7) feet and stationary objects (e.g. hydrants, sign post) shall
be at least one (1) foot from the edge of the sidewalk. Street trees in tree beds shall not be considered an
1. Multi-Use Path Along External Streets: The two-page layout for the applicable subdivision type in Article 6:
Subdivision Types shall determine the multi-use path material, where in the right-of-way the multi-use path
shall be located, and the multi-use path’s width. The following are additional standards that apply to internal
street sidewalks.
a. Crossings: Multi-use path shall be designed to safely cross entrance streets and other street intersections to
sidewalks or multi-use path on the opposite side. Blocks that are greater than 1,500 feet between intersections
may be required by the Plan Commission to install a mid-block crossing with appropriate design for
safety. The developer shall only be responsible for on-site improvements.
b. ADA Compliance: Multi-use paths at street intersections shall have ADA compliant ramps.
c. Free of Obstacles: All multi-use paths shall be free of obstacles, including overhead obstacles and
obstacles adjacent to the multi-use path. Overhead clearance shall be eight (8) feet and stationary objects
(e.g. hydrants, sign post) shall be at least two (2) feet from the edge of the multi-use path.
2. Connection to Adjacent or Nearby Amenity: If the proposed development is adjacent to a school, park, recreation
facility, shopping center, or other amenity, the developer shall design an easement and arrange lots such
that a multi-use path can be installed, linking the internal pedestrian network to the amenity. The multi-use
path shall meet the following standards:
a. Easement Width: The easement shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide.
b. Connector Path Width: The multi-use path shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in wide.
c. Location: The multi-use path shall stub to the adjacent property at an appropriate location (e.g. safe,
efficient route, or where a path has already been constructed on the adjacent property) for it to be continued
on by the adjacent property owner, or by the Town of Brownsburg if appropriate. Coordination with the
adjacent property owner shall be required.
d. Any multi-use path stubbed to the subject development shall be connected to the internal pedestrian
network.
Article
Article 7: Design Standards 7-33
Pedestrian Network Standards (PN) 7
D. ADA Compliance: The developer shall submit a letter from the Civil Engineer that designed the subdivision’s
infrastructure certifying that the sidewalks, as designed and constructed meet all applicable ADA laws in effect.
This letter shall be submitted prior to Secondary Plat approval, or shall be a prerequisite for release of the applicable
performance surety.
E. Non-application Clause: When sidewalks and/or multi-use paths are not required, or the development gets relief
from installing sidewalks and/or multi-use paths, the Town of Brownsburg shall not, now or in the future, be
obligated to install them. Every lot within the subject subdivision shall have a non-application clause recorded as a
legal instrument, applicable in perpetuity, stating that the property owner waives the right to application the Town
of Brownsburg for a sidewalk and/or multi-use path to be installed at the Town of Brownsburg’s expense. This
waiver does not restrict private funding to be used for such improvements to be made.
7.29 PN-02: Mid-block Crossing Standards
This Pedestrian Network Standards (PN) section applies to the following types of development:
A. Applicability: Any developments with internal streets with one (1) or more blocks greater than 1,400 feet between
intersections shall install a mid-block crossing which complies with the following standards.
B. Location: A required mid-block crossing shall be located at the mid-point between intersections. However, the
exact location may be adjusted fifty (50) feet in either direction from the mid-point to avoid driveway cuts, trees,
utilities, drainage, and similar contextual elements; and to improve sight visibility when the mid-point is along a
curved segment.
C. Narrowing Crossing: A required mid-block crossing shall be designed such that a pedestrian only has to cross the
travel lanes of the street. If parking lanes exist, the curb-line shall be narrowed (i.e. bumped-out).
D. Perpendicular Crossing: All mid-block crossings shall be within ten degrees (10°) of perpendicular.
E. Discretion: When a mid-block crossing is required by the above standards, yet the context clearly does not necessitate
a mid-block crossing, the Zoning Administrator may waive or modify the required mid-block crossing. One
or more of the following finding shall be required for the Zoning Administrator to waive the requirement:
1. Lack of Need: The street segment clearly will not have enough pedestrian users that would benefit from a
mid-block crossing.
2. Safety Concern: The street segment is clearly too dangerous for a mid-block crossing.
3. Single-loaded Street: The street segment only has homes or amenities located on one (1) side of the street.

E. Naming and Addressing Principles: All streets, public and private, shall meet the following street name criteria.
1. Proposed Street Name: The applicant shall propose a unique name for each street within the development at
the time of initial application. The proposed street names shall meet the following criteria.
a. Extensions: Streets which are extensions, continuations, or in alignment with any existing street, platted
right-of-way, or recorded access easement, shall bear the name of the existing street.
b. Root Name: The root street name (e.g. Maple) shall not duplicate or be phonetically similar to any existing
street name in the Town of Brownsburg.
c. Suffix Name: Deviations in suffix names (e.g. Street, Court, or Avenue) shall not constitute a unique name
(for example, if Maple Street existed, the name Maple Court would not be permissible).
d. Large Developments: Streets within a large development or separate developments within close proximity
may be authorized to use the same root name by the Plan Commission.
2. Proposed Address Numbers: Street address numbers for all lots shall be consistent with the Town’s existing
address scheme and shall be approved by the Town of Brownsburg.
3. Approval Authority: While street names and address numbers proposed by the applicant shall be considered,
the Plan Commission has authority to approve or deny any proposed street name or address number.
4. Renaming Authority:
a. Existing Street Names and Address Numbers: Existing street names and address numbers that have been
established or formerly approved by the Plan Commission shall not be changed without Plan Commission
approval.
b. Proposed Street Names and Address Numbers: The Plan Commission shall have authority to require a new
unique name for any street if the name proposed by the applicant is unacceptable. If an acceptable and
unique street name is not proposed by the applicant, the Plan Commission shall rename the street prior to
final approval. Likewise, if an unacceptable address number is proposed for a lot, the Plan Commission
shall have the authority to assign a new address number to any lot prior to final approval.
F. Additional Rights-of-way Required: When developments abut or include existing streets that do not meet the
minimum proposed right-of-way widths established by the Town of Brownsburg, the applicant shall dedicate the
additional width along such streets sufficient to meet the requirements. If the applicant only controls property on
one (1) side of the street, sufficient right-of-way shall be dedicated to bring the half right-of-way up to the width
required.
1. Off-site Street Improvements: When a development requires off-site street improvements, such as a passing
blister, acceleration lane, or deceleration lane, and inadequate right-of-way exists to install the off-site street
improvement, the applicant shall make a good faith effort to acquire property sufficient for the installation of
the off-site improvement. If the owner of the property on which the off-site improvement is to be installed
refuses to sell the property to the applicant, the applicant shall provide the Zoning Administrator with copies of
all surveys; appraisals; written offers made by the applicant; and correspondence from the property owner.
2. Eminent Domain: When the installation of off-site street improvements is required, it is because those off-site
street improvements are vital to the health, safety, and welfare of the motoring public. As a result, the Town
may begin eminent domain proceedings in accordance with IC 32-24: Eminent Domain for the acquisition of
public right-of-way sufficient for the installation of the off-site street improvement upon receipt of the aforementioned
documentation illustrating the applicants failure to acquire the needed property. Upon completion
of the eminent domain proceedings, the applicant shall reimburse the Town in an amount equal to the cost of
the land, administrative cost for condemnation on that land, and the cost to relocated any pre-existing features.
3. Installation of Improvements: The applicant shall then install the off-site street improvement to meet or exceed
the Town of Brownsburg Construction Standards.

Nonconformances
Town of Brownsburg Unified Development Ordinance
Article
8-02
Intent of Nonconformance Rules 8
8.01 Intent of Nonconformance Rules
As new zoning regulations are adopted or the zoning map changes, structures, lots, and uses that were previously
compliant with zoning regulation are sometimes made noncompliant. Article 8: Nonconformances specifies the provisions
that apply to these legal nonconforming (informally referred to as “grandfathered”) structures, lots, and uses.
8.02 Distinction Between Conforming, Illegal Nonconforming, and Legal Nonconforming
Each structure, lot, and use is either “conforming” or “nonconforming.” Conforming is used to describe a structure,
lot, or use as being in full compliance with the current Unified Development Ordinance. Nonconforming is used to
describe a structure, lot, or use that is in violation of the current Unified Development Ordinance. A nonconforming
structure, lot, or use is either “illegal nonconforming” or “legal nonconforming.” The following sections determine the
nonconforming status of a structure, lot, or use:
A. Illegal Nonconforming:
1. Structure: A structure constructed in violation of the zoning ordinance that was in effect when the structure
was constructed and which remains in violation of the current Unified Development Ordinance is an illegal
nonconforming structure.
2. Lot: A lot established in violation of the zoning ordinance that was in effect when the lot was established and
which remains in violation of the current Unified Development Ordinance is an illegal nonconforming lot.
3. Use: A use that was in violation of the zoning ordinance that was in effect when the use was initiated and
which remains in violation of the current Unified Development Ordinance is an illegal nonconforming use.
In addition, a use that was legally established prior to the effective date of the current Unified Development
Ordinance and is not permitted under the current Unified Development Ordinance, but has been abandoned or
discontinued for a period of at least one (1) year, is an illegal nonconforming use.
B. Legal Nonconforming:
1. Structure: A structure that does not meet one (1) or more development standards of the current Unified
Development Ordinance, but was legally established prior to the effective date of the current Unified
Development Ordinance shall be deemed a legal nonconforming structure. Generally, a structure is rendered
legal nonconforming by an amendment to the zoning regulations or a zoning map change. However, a legal
nonconformity may be a result of government use of eminent domain or right‑of‑way acquisition.
2. Lot: A lot that does not meet one (1) or more lot standards of the current Unified Development Ordinance, but
was legally established and recorded prior to the effective date of the current Unified Development Ordinance
shall be deemed a legal nonconforming lot of record. Generally, a lot is rendered legal nonconforming by an
amendment to the zoning regulations or a zoning map change. However, a legal nonconformity may be a result
of government use of eminent domain or right‑of‑way acquisition.
3. Use: The use of a structure or land (or a structure and land in combination) that was legally established prior
to the effective date of the current Unified Development Ordinance and has been continuously operated since,
that is no longer permitted by the current Unified Development Ordinance in the zoning district in which it is
located, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use. Generally, a use is rendered legal nonconforming by an
amendment to the zoning regulations or a zoning map change.
8.03 Illegal Nonconforming Structures, Lots, and Uses
An illegal nonconforming structure, lot, or use is subject to the enforcement procedures of the current Unified
Development Ordinance. The enforcement procedures of the zoning ordinance in place at the time the violation
occurred shall no longer be in effect.
8.04 Legal Nonconforming Structures
The following provisions apply to legal nonconforming structures, structures associated with legal nonconforming uses,
and structures associated with legal nonconforming lots.
A. Legal Nonconforming Building Provisions: The provisions for legal nonconforming buildings, a subcategory of
structures, are as follows:
1. Building Expansion: A legal nonconforming building shall be permitted to expand in area and height as long
as the nonconformity is not increased and the expansion otherwise meets the current Unified Development
Ordinance. For example, if a building is in violation of the maximum height standard, it can be expanded in
area as long as the new addition does not exceed the maximum height standard and is otherwise in compliance
with the current Unified Development Ordinance. This provisions does not waive applicable permits.
Article
Article 8: Nonconformances 8-03
Legal Nonconforming Structures 8
2. Building Exterior Alteration: The exterior walls of a building shall not be moved except as provided in the
previous clause. Otherwise, the roof and exterior walls may be maintained, repaired, re-faced, and modified,
resulting in the original aesthetic character or an altered exterior character, as long as the building’s nonconformity
is not increased and the alteration otherwise meets the current Unified Development Ordinance. This
provisions does not waive applicable permits.
3. Building Interior Alteration: Ordinary repair and replacement of interior finishes, heating systems, fixtures,
electrical systems, or plumbing systems; and interior wall modifications are not regulated by the Unified
Development Ordinance. This provisions does not waive applicable permits.
4. Building Relocating: A legal nonconforming building may be relocated if, by moving the building, it decreases
the legal nonconformity and the relocation otherwise meets the current Unified Development Ordinance. This
provisions does not waive applicable permits.
B. Legal Nonconforming Structure Provisions: The provisions for legal nonconforming structures, excluding the
subcategory of buildings, are as follows:
1. Structure Alteration: A legal nonconforming structure shall be permitted to be altered in height, area, mass,
and time as long as the nonconformity is not increased and the alteration otherwise meets the current Unified
Development Ordinance. For example, if a permanent sign is in violation of the maximum height standard,
it can be altered as long as the alteration does not increase the sign’s height and the alteration is otherwise in
compliance with Unified Development Ordinance. This provisions does not waive applicable permits.
2. Structure Relocating: A legal nonconforming structure may be relocated to another location on the same lot if,
by moving the structure, it decreases the legal nonconformity and the relocation otherwise meets the current
Unified Development Ordinance and any applicable commitments or conditions of a previous approval. This
provisions does not waive other applicable permits.
3. Conversion for Longevity: Converting a structural component of a legal nonconforming structure to a more
permanent material in order to prolong legal nonconformity shall not be permitted. For example, a legal
nonconforming permanent pole sign would not be permitted to replace its existing wood posts with metal posts
even if dimensionally the same size. This provisions does not waive applicable permits.
C. Loss of Legal Nonconforming Structure Status: The following provisions apply to all types of legal nonconforming
structures:
1. Condemned Structures: If a legal nonconforming structure, through lack of maintenance, is declared by an
authorized official to be condemned due to its physical or unsafe condition, it shall lose its legal nonconforming
status and become illegal nonconforming; unless the structure is restored or repaired within three (3) months of
the declaration to a standard which clearly overcomes the physical or unsafe condition as supported in writing
by the authorized official after re-inspection. The Zoning Administrator may grant an appropriate extension of
time if work was started within the initial three (3) month period and reasonable attempts are being made by the
owner to remedy the condemnation.
2. Removal of Permanent Structures: If a legal nonconforming permanent structure is fully removed or razed, it
shall lose its legal nonconforming status; further, if a permanent structure is or significantly removed or razed
(i.e. 80% or more of the structure), the remaining permanent structure shall lose its legal nonconforming status
and become illegal nonconforming; unless by significantly removing or razing the permanent structure the
remaining permanent structure is in compliance or more in compliance with the current Unified Development
Ordinance.
3. Moved or Removal of Temporary Structures: If a legal nonconforming temporary structure is moved or
removed (e.g. moved inside, moved to a new on-site location, or taken off-site), the legal nonconforming
temporary structure shall lose its legal nonconforming status and become illegal nonconforming.
4. Flood: If a legal nonconforming structure is damaged from a flood, resulting in a loss of either fifty percent
(50%) of its market value or fifty percent (50%) of the physical structure, all reconstruction shall be required
to meet the current Unified Development Ordinance. All other flood damaged legal nonconforming structures
shall be allowed to rebuild the structure that previously existed.
5. Acts of Nature or Fire: If a legal nonconforming structure is damaged from an act of nature or fire, excluding
flooding, resulting in a loss of either seventy percent (70%) of its market value or seventy percent (70%) of
the physical structure, all reconstruction shall be required to meet the current Unified Development Ordinance.
All other structures damaged by an act of nature or fire shall be allowed to rebuild the structure that previously
existed.
D. Maintenance and Repair: Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the normal maintenance or repair of a
legal nonconforming structure to keep it in a safe, aesthetic, and functional condition.
Town of Brownsburg Unified Development Ordinance
Article
8-04
Legal Nonconforming Lots 8
8.05 Legal Nonconforming Lots
The following provisions apply to legal nonconforming lots:
A. Legal Nonconforming Lot Provisions: A legal nonconforming lot shall be permitted to be developed and utilized as
long as proposed structure(s) and use(s) meet the current Unified Development Ordinance. All standards other than
the minimum lot area, maximum lot area, and lot measurement standards shall still apply.
B. Loss of Legal Nonconforming Lot Status:
1. Lots used in Combination: If a legal nonconforming lot is used in combination with an adjacent lot owned by
the same person resulting in conformity with the current Unified Development Ordinance, it shall lose its legal
nonconforming status.
2. Combining Lots Results in Conformity: If a legal nonconforming lot is joined with an adjacent lot making the
combined lot conforming, the legal nonconforming lot shall permanently lose its legal nonconforming status.
3. Permanent Structure Across Property Lines: If a legal nonconforming lot is owned by the same person as an
adjacent lot, and the owner is granted permission (i.e. a variance) to construct a permanent structure across the
property line of the two (2) lots, thus permanently using the two (2) lots in combination, then the legal nonconforming
lot shall lose its legal nonconforming status at the time the permanent structure is constructed across
the property line or at the time this Unified Development Ordinance was adopted if the improvement already
existed; provided the two (2) lots in combination would constitute a single conforming lot.
Article
Article 8: Nonconformances 8-05
Legal Nonconforming Use 8
8.06 Legal Nonconforming Use
The following provisions apply to legal nonconforming uses:
A. Cross Reference:
1. Agricultural: With respect to agricultural legal nonconforming uses, nothing in this section shall be interpreted
in a manner that is inconsistent with IC 36‑7‑4‑616: Unified Development Ordinance; Agricultural
Nonconforming Use.
B. Exemptions: A use that was legally established in a zoning district that was subsequently rezoned, making it a
special exception use, shall be recognized and treated as being a legal use as if it were listed as a permitted use (i.e.
not a legal nonconforming use) in the new zoning district. However, the declaration of it being a permitted use
shall only apply to the subject lot on which the use was legally established. This exemption shall not apply if the
use is abandoned or changed as described in Section 8.06(D): Loss of Legal Nonconforming Use Status below.
C. Legal Nonconforming Use Provisions: The provisions for legal nonconforming uses are as follows:
1. Utilizing Existing, Enlarged, New, or Relocated Buildings: A legal nonconforming use shall be permitted
to occupy or use an existing building, enlarged existing building, newly constructed building, or relocated
building, provided the building meets the current Unified Development Ordinance.
2. Utilizing Existing, Altered, New, or Relocated Structures: A legal nonconforming use shall be permitted to
utilize an existing structure, altered existing structure, newly constructed structure, or relocated structure,
provided the structure meets the current Unified Development Ordinance.
3. Utilizing Land: Any legal nonconforming use shall be permitted to utilize its lot, or lots owned in combination
upon the effective date of the current Unified Development Ordinance. However, increasing the land area
utilized by ten percent (10%) or more shall require compliance with applicable setback standards, landscaping
standards, buffering requirements, lot coverage, environmental, and parking standards within the current
Unified Development Ordinance.
4. Expansion to a Previously Owned Adjacent Lot: A legal nonconforming use shall not be expanded onto an
adjacent, vacant lot unless:
a. The lot has previously and clearly been used in conjunction with the legal nonconforming use, and
b. The lot was previously and formally approved for the same legal nonconforming use, and
c. The lot was owned by the same person upon the effective date of the current Unified Development
Ordinance.
5. Expansion to a Newly Owned Adjacent Lot: Any lot purchased after the effective date of the current Unified
Development Ordinance shall not be granted legal nonconforming use status to expand a legal nonconforming
use.
6. Increase in Nonconformity: A legal nonconforming use shall not be permitted to change or increase its nonconformity,
unless in compliance with or in greater compliance with the current Unified Development Ordinance.
The number of employees, changes in inventory, and changes to vehicular traffic shall not in itself increase
nonconformity of a use. For example, adding an employee shall not change the use, but adding a different use
that is not permitted in the current Unified Development Ordinance shall not be permitted.
D. Loss of Legal Nonconforming Use Status:
1. Abandonment of Use: If a legal nonconforming use is abandoned or is discontinued for one (1) year or more
shall lose its legal nonconforming status. Any subsequent use shall conform to the provisions of the current
Unified Development Ordinance. This rule shall not apply to a use that was suspended due to litigation or a
forced government action.
2. Change of Use: When a legal nonconforming use is changed, altered, or evolves to be in compliance or more
in compliance with the current Unified Development Ordinance, the legal nonconforming use status is lost or
partially lost, respectively. In either situation, the current use cannot revert back to the original legal nonconforming
use or increments thereof.

Improvement Location Permit 9
9.02 Improvement Location Permit
This process applies to the following zoning districts:
A. Applicability: An Improvement Location Permit shall be required prior to permanent construction, installation,
addition, alteration, or relocation of a structure; prior to permanent alteration to the land; and prior to establishment
of a new land use or change of an existing land use, except when the language in the ordinance clearly exempts the
improvement.
B. Exemption from Improvement Location Permit: This exemption is only from having to obtain an Improvement
Location Permit. It is not an exemption from having to meet all other applicable regulations in the Unified
Development Ordinance. Any project exempt from having to acquire an Improvement Location Permit that is in
violation of the Unified Development Ordinance is subject to Article 10: Enforcement. The following projects are
exempt from having to obtain an Improvement Location Permit.
1. Projects that Require a Temporary Improvement Location Permit: A project that requires a Temporary
Improvement Location Permit shall be exempt from obtaining an Improvement Location Permit.
2. Small Structures: An accessory structure that is ninety (90) square feet or less in area is exempt from obtaining
an Improvement Location Permit.
3. Softscaping and Hardscaping: Installing trees, shrubs, plants, and flowers; applying mulch or soil enhancers;
raising of planting beds around foundations; and installing accent hardscaping (e.g. stone steps, stone edging,
and small retaining walls) is exempt from obtaining an Improvement Location Permit as long as there is no
adverse affect to drainage.
4. Deck or Patio: A deck or patio installed individually or cumulatively that is ninety (90) square feet or less in
area over the entire lot is exempt from obtaining an Improvement Location Permit.
5. Sign Content Change: Sign content, including changing a sign face with the same material, may be changed
without having to receive an Improvement Location Permit.
6. Flag Pole: Flag poles may be installed without obtaining an Improvement Location Permit.
7. Play Set: Play sets may be installed without obtaining an Improvement Location Permit.
8. Type 1 Home Business: Type 1 home businesses may commence without obtaining an Improvement Location
Permit.
9. Property Maintenance: Maintenance and repairs to the existing structure or site features may commence
without obtaining an Improvement Location Permit.
10. Replacing Light Fixtures: Existing light fixtures and bulbs may be replaced without obtaining an Improvement
Location Permit. However, replacement lighting fixtures shall not violate applicable Lighting Standards
(LT), commitments, or conditions of the development’s approval, or any other standards within the Unified
Development Ordinance.
Article
Article 9: Processes 9-05
Improvement Location Permit 9
C. Cross Reference:
1. Building Permit: An Improvement Location Permit does not authorize compliance with building codes.
Concurrent to having a project reviewed for compliance with the Unified Development Ordinance most
projects with any type of building will also have to be reviewed for compliance with the Building Code. The
review for compliance with the Building Code is conducted by the Building Commissioner and is a separate
process from the Improvement Location Permit.
2. Stormwater Permit: An Improvement Location Permit does not authorize compliance with the Brownsburg
Stormwater Management Ordinance. See Section 151: Stormwater Management Ordinance in the Town Code
for the specific process and applicable regulations.
3. Other Permits: An Improvement Location Permit does not authorize compliance with any county, state or
federal Permits. It is the responsibility of the property owner to acquire any other required permits prior to
making any improvement.
D. Filing Requirements:
1. Application: Application for an Improvement Location Permit shall be made on a form provided by the Zoning
Administrator and shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator during normal business hours. The applicant
shall submit multiple copies of the application and materials if requested by the Zoning Administrator. Plans
or illustrations filed as part of an application shall be drawn to a scale sufficient to permit a clear and precise
understanding of the contents of the plans and of the proposal being made.
E. Permit Procedure:
1. Substantially Complete Application: An application for an Improvement Location Permit shall not be reviewed
for approval until it is determined to be substantially complete by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator must first verify that the application form and any required supplemental information has been
submitted correctly, and the applicable application fee has been paid.
2. Review the Project’s Compliance: After the application has been verified as being substantially complete, the
Zoning Administrator shall review the project to determine whether it complies with the Unified Development
Ordinance. The Zoning Administrator may consult with other Brownsburg staff, or any other person, department,
or group to determine if the project complies with all of the provisions of the Unified Development
Ordinance. During the review process, the Zoning Administrator may:
a. Request Additional Information: During the process of rendering a decision, the Zoning Administrator
may request additional information deemed necessary to determine whether the project complies with the
Unified Development Ordinance.
b. Exercise Discretion: Some provisions within the Unified Development Ordinance allow the Zoning
Administrator to apply discretion to a decision. If such discretion is exercised, the Zoning Administrator
shall describe the decision and cite the authority for that discretion.
c. Interpret the Unified Development Ordinance: Because the Unified Development Ordinance cannot
address every possible unique situation, project features, or land use, the Zoning Administrator shall
interpret the intent of the Unified Development Ordinance when a situation is not specifically addressed.
3. Render a Decision: The Zoning Administrator shall render a “decision to deny” or “decision to approve” based
on the information submitted, project review, discretion exercised, and interpretations made.
4. Issuing an Improvement Location Permit: If the proposed project complies with the Unified Development
Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall render a decision to approve, document the terms of the approval
on the permit, and then issue an Improvement Location Permit. The Zoning Administrator shall also issue
a placard to the applicant. The placard is to be posted in a conspicuous place on the subject property for the
duration of the project.
5. Decision to Deny an Improvement Location Permit: If the proposed project does not comply with the Unified
Development Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall not issue an Improvement Location Permit. The
Zoning Administrator shall document the reasons for not issuing an Improvement Location Permit and send
that information to the applicant by email or US Mail, or by telephone. If an email is used to communicate
denial, documentation that the email was received shall be included in the file. Similarly, if a phone call
is used to communicate denial, documentation of the phone call shall be included in the file. If the Zoning
Administrator renders a decision to deny an Improvement Location Permit the applicant may promptly revise
the application, or may promptly pursue relief from the Unified Development Ordinance.
6. Allowance for Revision Prior to a Decision: At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the applicant
may be permitted to modify the site plan, application form, or attachments prior to a decision by the Zoning
Administrator.
Town of Brownsburg Unified Development Ordinance
Article
9-06
Improvement Location Permit 9
7. Allowance for Revision After a Decision: After a decision to deny, the applicant may promptly revise the site
plan, application form, or attachment in order to comply with the Unified Development Ordinance without

Subdivision of Land; Administrative 9
9.19 Subdivision of Land; Administrative
A. Purpose and Intent: An Administrative Subdivision provides the Town of Brownsburg with the opportunity to
expedite adjustments to property lines and mergers of existing lots into fewer lots when such adjustments are
considered non-impacting to the town or surrounding properties.
B. Project Applicability: An Administrative Subdivision can be used to modify the division of property within the
planning jurisdiction, but only if the proposed modification meets the “Applicable Districts,” “Applicable Actions,”
and “Prerequisites” standards listed below. All other divisions of land or alterations to property lines shall be
processed as a Minor Subdivision or Major Subdivision.
1. Applicable Districts: An Administrative Subdivision of land shall be permitted in the following zoning districts:
2. Applicable Actions: The following actions may use the Administrative Subdivision process. However, any
action that does not clearly fit the below described actions, or that for any other reason necessitates more
extensive review, can be denied use of the Administrative Subdivision process by the Zoning Administrator.
Such cases shall then be processed as a minor or major subdivision application.
a. Merging Common Ownership Lots: The owner of two (2) to five (5) lots may merge them together as
fewer buildable lots when the resulting lot(s) do(es) not create any new nonconformance or an escalation in
nonconformance; and when there is no increase in public service demand, change to streets, or increase in
the intensity of utilities.
b. Splitting a Lot and Merging its Pieces with Two or More Adjacent Lots: Two (2) or more owners adjacent
to a vacant lot may jointly purchase the lot, divide it, and merge all of the pieces with their buildable lot. If
the lot is not vacant, any primary structure would have to first be demolished and/or primary use dissolved,
prior to application for an Administrative Subdivision.
c. Adjusting Lot Lines: The owners of contiguous properties mutually agree to adjust a lot line separating
their two (2) properties due to either a survey error or both owners mutually desiring the adjustment; as
long as the adjustment does not result in any new nonconformance or an escalation in an existing nonconformance;
or does not reduce either’s lot area by more than twenty percent (20%).
d. Creating Non-Developable Land for Utilities and Infrastructure: A public utility or municipality which
acquires land for non-development purposes may process the transition and/or adjustment to property lines
as an Administrative Subdivision. Non-development purposes excludes occupiable structures, communication
towers and treatment facilities. It is the expectation of this provision to be used to create parcels for
below-grade pipes, wires and fiber, and at-grade drainage ways, junction boxes, lift stations, inlets, and
similar common and incidental utility features.
C. Prerequisites:
1. Eligible Applicant: An application for an Administrative Subdivision shall be initiated by the owner(s) of
all applicable lots or the owner’s authorized agent. If an authorized agent files an application, a signed and
notarized consent form from the owner(s) shall accompany the application.

hard copies of all supporting information; and one (1) digital copy of the application for an Administrative
Subdivision and all supporting information in .pdf (portable document format).
6. Fees: The applicable fee from the Town of Brownsburg Code of Ordinances shall be paid at the time the
application for a Administrative Subdivision is filed. An application without the appropriate application fee
shall not be considered substantially complete. Technical expertise necessary to review a Administrative
Subdivision that the Town of Brownsburg does not have adequate proficiency may constitute hiring a professional
consultant to conduct the review or portions thereof at the expense of the applicant and as per the Town
of Brownsburg’s Code of Ordinances.
E. Procedure and Approval:

preliminary injunction (i.e. stop work order) to the violator if he refuses to sign the terms of the memorandum
of agreement, giving the Enforcement Official time necessary to pursue other enforcement options without
furtherance of the violation or alleged violation.

the Enforcement Official shall not begin another enforcement option until the time frame has expired and a
violation remains unresolved.
D. Safety from Fines: The Enforcement Official shall not impose a fine to a violator if a request to remedy is the first

Development Ordinance or be a unique court ruling that fulfills the intent of the Brownsburg Comprehensive
Plan and Unified Development Ordinance. The severity of the court ruling may consider the severity of the
violation, impact to property values in the area, impact to quality of life in the area, impact to the health, safety
and welfare of the public, repetitiveness of similar violations by the same violator, and/or the precedent that
may be set by the ruling. If successful in the enforcement of the Unified Development Ordinance, the court of

remedy may include enforcing the condition, covenant, or commitment, or be a unique court ruling
that fulfills the intent of the Brownsburg Comprehensive Plan and Unified Development Ordinance. The
severity of the court ruling may consider the severity of the non-compliance, impact to property values in the
area, impact to quality of life in the area, impact to the health, safety and welfare of the public, repetitiveness of
similar violations by the same violator, and/or the precedent that may be set by the ruling. If successful in the

result in a unique court ruling that fulfills the intent of the Brownsburg Comprehensive Plan and Unified
Development Ordinance. The severity of the court ruling may consider the severity of the violation, impact to
property values in the area, impact to quality of life in the area, impact to the health, safety and welfare of the
public, repetitiveness of similar violations by the same violator, and the precedent that may be set by the ruling.

Recommended Plant Material
A. Introduction: The physical and environmental characteristics for a number of landscape plants are given here.
Unless otherwise noted, plants on this list are hardy in central Indiana, tolerant of the built environment, easily
maintained and commercially available. Other suitable plants may be commercially available as new cultivars are
developed.
The tables are arranged by plant size (largest to smallest), and they specify the following characteristics:
1. Evergreen Plant: Useful if you want year-round interest or if you need a screen to block a view.
2. Average Spread: Denotes the average diameter of a plant’s foliage so that you will have some idea of the
mature size of a plant.
3. Growth Rate: Denotes the speed at which a plant will grow given typical growing conditions.
4. Density: Denotes how easy it is to see through a plant’s foliage.
5. Form: Denotes the shape of the plant’s foliage and limbs.
6. Sunlight Requirement: Denotes the amount of sunlight required by a plant.
7. Soil Moisture Requirement: Denotes the amount of soil moisture required by a plant.
8. Comments: Lists any special attributes and/or requirements for a plant. It also lists available and proven
cultivars.
