MERCED, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Merced, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 26, 1-09, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
The Merced, California, Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1981, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. Commencing with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, Municipal Code Corporation has assumed supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2499, passed March 18, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 26, 1-09, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 26, 1-09, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens and/or periods. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com.

Chapter 3.08 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 
 
3.08.010 - Short title. 
This chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax regulations of the city. 
(Prior code § 26.101).  
3.08.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
A.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
B.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, including any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
C.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
D.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and he shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
(Prior code § 26.102).  
3.08.030 - Amount and payment. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If, for any reason the tax due is not paid the operator of the hotel, the finance officer may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the finance officer. 
(Ord. 1936 § 1, 1996: Ord. 1771 § 1, 1990: Ord. 1714 § 1, 1988: Ord. 1595 § 1, 1985: Ord. 1142 § 1, 1975: prior code § 26.103).  
3.08.040 - Collection and advertisement restrictions. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Prior code § 26.105).  
3.08.050 - Registration certificate. 
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this chapter, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the finance officer and obtain from him a "Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
1.  The name of the operator. 
2.  The address of the hazel. 
3.  The date upon which the certificate was issued. 
4.  This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in any unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit. 
(Prior code § 26.106).  
3.08.060 - Reports and remittances. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the finance officer, make a return to the finance officer, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the finance officer. The finance officer may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collections of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of this city until payment thereof is made to the finance officer. 
(Prior code § 26.107).  
3.08.070 - Penalties for failure to remit tax when due. 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to rest any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
B.  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to emit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquent penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the finance officer determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid in this chapter. 
(Ord. 1585 § 1, 1985: prior code § 29.108).  
3.08.080 - Tax default investigation and hearing. 
If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the finance officer shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the finance officer procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the finance officer shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may, within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the finance officer for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the finance officer shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the finance officer shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the finance officer shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days. 
(Prior code § 26.109). 
(Ord. No. 2434, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
3.08.090 - Appeals. 
A.  Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the finance officer with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. 
B.  Payment of all tax, interest, and penalties shall be required at the time a notice of appeal is filed with the city clerk. No appeal pursuant to this section shall be taken unless such payment in full is made. 
C.  Any taxes the city council determines should not have been assessed shall be refunded to the operator, along with the apportioned interest and penalties paid on such taxes. 
(Prior code § 26.110). 
(Ord. No. 2434, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
3.08.100 - Records to be kept. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of any payment to the city, which records the finance officer shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Prior code § 26.111).  
3.08.110 - Refunds. 
A.  Claim by Operator. An operator may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city when it is established in a manner prescribed by the finance officer that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
B.  Claim by Transient. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim with the finance officer, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the finance officer, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the finance officer that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
C.  Evidence. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto, provided such claim is filed no later than one (1) year from the date of the overpayment. 
(Ord. 2316 § 13, 2008: prior code § 26.112).  
3.08.115 - Enjoining collection prohibited. 
No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against the city or an officer thereof, to prevent or enjoin the collection of taxes sought to be collected pursuant to this chapter, and payment of all tax, interest and penalties shall be required as a condition precedent to seeking judicial review of any tax liability. 
(Ord. No. 2434, § 3, 9-2-2014)  
3.08.120 - Collection by city by court action. 
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be a debt owed by the transient to the city.

Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. 
(Prior code § 26.113).  
3.08.130 - ViolationPenalties. 
A.  It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor, subject to punishment in accordance with Chapter 1.12 of this code, for any person to violate any of the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required in Section 3.08.060, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the finance officer, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is subject to punishment in accordance with Chapter 1.12 of this code, and as set forth in Section 3.08.080 hereof. Any person required to make, render, sign, or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor, subject to punishment in accordance with Chapter 1.12 of this code, and punishable as set forth in Section 3.08.080 hereof.

However, the city council may, by resolution, authorize examination of the returns by federal or state officers or employees or by the tax officer of this or any other city if a reciprocal arrangement exists.

Chapter 3.12 - CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTSNONDISCRIMINATION 
 
3.12.010 - Intent of chapter. 
In conjunction with this chapter the city intends to become a forceful catalyst to bring about the full cooperation of all the necessary elements of the community, including public and private agencies, developers, contractors, subcontractors, labor unions and job training and manpower programs, to end discrimination resulting from such discrimination in employment and advancement. 
(Prior code § 2.60).  
3.12.020 - City manager to enforce compliance. 
The city manager shall act as compliance officer in administering this chapter and on obtaining compliance with its provisions.

B.  Notwithstanding the above, the term "construction contract" shall not include the following: 
1.  Any contract between the city and any other governmental agency or entity or between the city and any public utility. 
2.  Any action taken by the city council or city manager in case of public emergency. 
3.  Any contract entered into pursuant to or under any special assessment proceedings or laws. 
(Prior code § 2.62).  
3.12.040 - Construction contractProvisions to be included. 
All construction contracts shall contain the following provision: 
In the performance of this contract the contractor will not refuse or fail to hire or employ any qualified person, or bar or discharge from employment any person, or discriminate against anti person with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such person's race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, sex or age. If the contractor or any of his subcontractors shall be found in violation of the above discrimination provisions, the contractor shall be deemed to be in material breach of the contract and thereupon the city shall have the power to do all or any of the following: (1) To cancel or suspend the contract in whole or in part, and (2) to deduct and retain from the amount payable to the contractor the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars for each person discriminated against in the performance of the contract for each calendar day during which such person was discriminated against in the performance of the contract, as liquidated damages for such breach of contract; provided, that the number of persons discriminated against shall not be deemed, for the purpose of determining the amount of such damages only, to exceed the number of positions in connection with which such discrimination occurs, e.g., if twenty persons are improperly discriminated against in connection with five positions, then the multiple used in assessing damages shall be the number of positions and not the number of persons discriminated against. In the event such finding is made after completion of the contract and after payment of all sums due contractor by the city, the contractor shall be obligated to pay such sum to the city upon demand by the city. Violations of such provisions by subcontractors shall, for the purposes of this provision, be deemed to be violations by the contractor. A contractor shall not be deemed in breach of the provisions of this paragraph unless the state fair employment practices commission or an appropriate federal commission or agency, or a court of the state finds, in any action or proceeding to which such contractor is a party, that the contractor or a subcontractor is a party, that the contractor or subcontractor discriminated against one or more specifically named employees or applicants for employment because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex or age in the performance of this contract, provided that such court has issued a final judgment in such action or proceeding, or that the fair employment practices commission has issued a final order pursuant to section 1420 of the Labor Code, or that such appropriate federal commission or agency has issued a final order or obtained a final injunction, and provided further, that for the purpose of this paragraph no judgment, order, decree or injunction shall be considered final during the period within which (1) appeal may be taken, or (2) the same has been stayed by order of the court or (3) further proceedings for vacation, reversal or modification are in progress before a competent administrative or judicial tribunal. 
The contractor shall include the provisions of the above paragraph in every subcontract so that such provision shall be binding upon each of his subcontractors and vendors. 
(Prior code § 2.63).  
3.12.050 - Construction contractAdditional provisions. 
Every construction contract which requires payment by the city to a contractor of a sum in excess of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) shall in addition to the provisions contained in Section 3.12.040 contain the following provisions: 
(1)  The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, national origin or ancestry, in connection with employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training including apprenticeship. Such affirmative action shall be in accordance with the affirmative action guidelines adopted by resolution of the city council, a copy of which is included in the contract documents. 
(2)  The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the city, setting forth that the contractor is prohibited from discriminating against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color or national origin or ancestry, and that the contractor is required to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without discrimination in connection with employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship; provided, that if a contractor is required by any federal or state law, order, rule or regulation to post a similar notice, such posting shall satisfy the requirements hereof.

To adopt a retail transactions (sales) and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. 
C.  To adopt a retail transactions (sales) and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes. 
D.  To adopt a retail transactions (sales) and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions (sales) and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

3.38.090 - Contract with state. 
Prior to the operative date of this chapter, as required by state law, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of the transactions (sales) and use tax imposed under this chapter; provided, however, that if the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date of this chapter, the city shall nevertheless contract and in such case the operative date of the transaction (sales) and use tax shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such contract.

The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state, or has more than one (1) place of business, the place or places at which retail sales are consummated shall be determined under the rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

B.  Gross Receipts Defined. The term 'gross receipts,' as used in this chapter is defined as follows: The total amount of the sale price of all sales, the total amount charged or received for the performance of an act, service or employment of whatsoever nature it may be, whether such service, act or employment is done as part of or in connection with the sale of goods, wares, merchandise or not, for which a charge is made, including all receipts, cash credits and property of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom an account of the costs of the property sold, the costs of the material used, labor or service costs, interests paid or payable, losses or any other expenses whatsoever; provided, that cash discounts allowed or taken on sales shall not be included and this section shall not be construed to impose any tax upon any business or transaction which the city is not authorized to license or tax under any law of the state or of the United States. Any tax required by law to be included in or added to the purchase price and collected from the consumer or purchaser, and such part of the sales price of any property previously sold returned by the purchaser to the seller which is refunded by the seller by way of cash or credit allowances given or taken as part payment on any property so accepted for resale, shall be deducted for the purpose of determining gross receipts under this section. 
C.  The term "gross profit," as used in this chapter, is defined as follows: 
The difference between the revenues or sales of a business and the related costs and expenses of producing revenues or sales, excluding income or revenue derived from sources other than its regular activities and before income deductions and selling, general and administrative expenses. Income deductions are a class of items which, although necessarily incurred in the course of business and customarily charged before arriving at net income, are more in the nature of costs imposed from without than costs subject to the control of everyday operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses are a grouping of expenses which include such items as salespersons' salaries and commissions, advertising and promotion, travel and entertainment, administrative office payroll and expenses, and executives' salaries. Gross profit percentage for purposes of determining business license classification is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenues or sales. 
D.  For purposes of determining eligibility and administering this section and Section 5.08.040, the regulations of the State Board of Equalization, State of California shall be used.

G.  Investigation. The animal control manager shall conduct such investigation of the background of the owner and the applicant and the history and physical condition of the kennel or cattery or keeping of the wild animal, including physical inspection of the premises, as is deemed appropriate.

(1)  Any animal owner who maintains an animal in such a manner as to permit or suffer it to exhibit dangerous behavior shall be guilty of an infraction. 
(2)  Any animal owner who maintains any animal in such a manner as to permit or suffer it to exhibit vicious behavior shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

If, or after an investigation, the animal control manger identifies facts which show the existence of a dangerous animal within the meaning of Section 6.04.010J of this chapter, he or she shall cause a dangerous animal hearing to be conducted. 
H.  Notice of hearing.

The city council in establishing this rule-making authority specifically reserves unto itself the authority to set rates and charges. 
B.

2.  That all recyclable material produced or accumulated at the property is disposed of by agreement with and through the use of the approved recycling container of a person subscribing to the service provided by the city; 
3.  That the person self-hauls all recyclable material to an approved buy-back center or processing site in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection B of this section. 
B.  Any person subject to the requirements of this chapter who opts to self-haul recyclable material that is produced or accumulated on the person's property ("self-haulers"), as permitted by subsection (A)(3) of this section shall do so subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The owner, occupant, or manager of a residential property may collect and transport recyclable material generated on the property to an authorized buy-back center or processing site. Owners, occupants, and managers of residential properties who self-haul such materials, as provided in this section, may not contract with any entity other than the city for transport services, unless: (a) the entity does not charge any transport fee, and (b) the entity pays the owner compensation for such materials. 
2.  The owner or manager of a commercial establishment may collect and transport recyclable material generated on the property to an authorized buy-back center or processing site.

Such self-haul certification shall be submitted on forms developed by the director of public works operations which includes a declaration under the penalty of perjury that the submittal is true and correct. The purpose of the submittal is to ensure that recyclable materials are diverted from landfills and that the city gets credit for such diversion under AB 939. Should any self-hauler fail to submit the self-hauler certification later than thirty (30) days after the reporting date therefor, the self-haul authorization shall be revoked following notice from the city and the self-hauler shall thereafter be subject to the rates and charges set forth in Section 8.04.630 of this chapter for a period of no less than two (2) years.

Chapter 8.06 - RECYCLING 
Sections: 
 
8.06.010 - Purpose. 
Cities and counties must divert 50 percent of all solid waste by January 1, 2000, through source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. 
Diverting 50 percent of all solid waste requires the participation of the residential, commercial, industrial, and public sectors. 
The lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials that are compatible with surrounding land uses is a significant impediment to diverting solid waste and constitutes an urgent need for state and local agencies to address access to solid waste for source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. This ordinance has been developed to meet that need. 
(Ord. 1854 § 1 (part), 1993).  
8.06.020 - Definitions. 
The following definitions shall apply to the language contained in this chapter. 
A.  Development project - Means any of the following: 
1.  A project for which building permit is required for a commercial, industrial, or institutional building, marina, or residential building having five or more living units, where solid waste is collected and loaded and any residential project where solid waste is collected and loaded in a location serving five(5) or more living units. 
2.  Any new public facility where solid waste is collected and loaded and any improvements for areas of a public facility used for collecting and loading solid waste. 
B.  Recycling area (area for recycling) - Space allocated for collecting and loading of recyclable materials. 
C.  Project for which a building permit is required - A project for which a building permit is required is, at a minimum: 
1.  all new projects, and 
2.  any single alteration of an existing project requiring a building permit, and 
3.  any sum total of alterations requiring a building permit to an existing project conducted within a twelve month period. 
(Ord. 1854 § 1 (part), 1993).  
8.06.030 - General requirements. 
Any new development project for which an application for a building permit is submitted on or after September 1, 1994, shall include adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials. 
Any improvements for areas of a public facility used for collecting and loading solid waste shall include adequate, accessible and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials. 
Any project for which an application for a building permit is submitted on or after September 1, 1994 for modifications that meet one or both of the conditions below shall include adequate, accessible and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials: 
A.  Modification to the project adds 30 percent or more to the existing floor area, or 
B.  The price of modification exceeds value of the subject parcel. 
(Ord. 1854 § 1 (part, 1993).  
8.06.040 - Design standards. 
Areas for recycling shall be adequate in capacity, number, and distribution to serve the development where the project occurs. 
Dimensions of the recycling area shall accommodate containers consistent with current methods of collection in the area in which the project is to be located. 
An adequate number of bins or containers to allow for the collection and loading of recyclable materials generated by the development should be located within the recycling areas of development projects. 
The design and construction of recycling areas shall be compatible with surrounding land uses. 
Recycling areas shall be secured to prevent the theft of recyclable materials by unauthorized persons, while allowing authorized persons access for disposal materials. 
Recycling areas or the bins or containers placed therein must provide protection against adverse environmental conditions which might render the collected materials unmarketable. 
Driveways or travel aisles shall provide unobstructed access for collection vehicles and personnel and provide at least the minimum clearance required by the collection methods and vehicles utilized by the hauler in the area in which the development project exists. 
A sign clearly identifying all recycling and solid waste collection and loading areas and the materials accepted therein shall be posted adjacent to all points of access to the recycling areas. 
Residential developers and property owners are encouraged to include recycling areas or systems within the residence; such as roll-out drawers below the sink for recycling receptacles; fireproof, cleanable, secure chutes from the living space to the space for collecting and loading recyclable materials, etc. Recommended internal storage space for individual living units of residential development projects is three (3) cubic feet. 
(Ord. 1854 § 1 (part), 1993).  
8.06.050 - Location. 
Recycling areas shall not be located in any area required by the Municipal Code to be constructed or maintained as unencumbered, according to fire and other applicable building and/or public safety laws. 
Each recycling area within a multi-family residential development should be no greater than 250 feet from each living unit. 
(Ord. 1854 § 1 (part), 1993).  
8.06.060 - Commingled waste. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a development project located in an area served by a recycling system based upon the collection of commingled solid waste and recyclable materials may fulfill the requirements of this chapter by providing adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading commingled solid waste recyclable materials. 
(Ord. 1854 § 1 (part), 1993).  
Chapter 8.12 - WATER WELLS

The intent of these standards is to prevent mixing or transfer of degraded waters into aquifers of good quality water through wells or open borings. These standards are written to address the specific hydrogeologic conditions of the city. 
(Ord. 1754 § 1, 1990: prior code § 29.1).  
8.12.020 - Applicability. 
The standards set forth in this chapter apply to all new and existing water wells, monitoring wells, cathodic protection wells, test wells and those exploratory holes deeper than twenty feet within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. 
(Ord. 1754 § 1, 1990: prior code § 29.2).  
8.12.030 - Special ground water protection. 
The city is underlain by various geologic units which consist of unconsolidated and consolidated sediments that contain permeable layers, or aquifers, of varying depth and dimension intermixed with low permeability sediments. The city's water supply relies on the production of ground water from three aquifer zones which are separated by low permeability layers. These three aquifers are called the "shallow", "intermediate" and "Mehrten." Layers of lower permeability are common, but three distinctive and generally continuous layers are known. These low permeability layers are called the "shallow confining layer", the "Corcoran Clay" and the "300-foot clay." Deeper aquifers of good quality water may also exist and must be protected. 
Recent pollution and contamination by organic chemicals has been found in the shallow and intermediate aquifers. Because it has been determined that ground water problems are known to exist, all ground water within the city's sphere of influence is hereby designated, pursuant to authority granted under the State of California Water Code, Section 13801, as requiring "Special Ground Water Protection." The intent of this chapter is to minimize the impacts and prevent the migration of harmful chemicals into aquifers used by the city. 
(Ord. 1754 § 1, 1990: prior code § 29.3).  
8.12.040 - Implementation standards. 
A.  Implementation, performance of inspections, and enforcement of compliance with this chapter shall be the responsibility of the director or his assignee. 
B.  Within five years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the owner, operator or permittee of an existing private well within the city must destroy any existing well in accordance with this chapter. 
C.  All persons owning an abandoned well within the city shall destroy the well before December 31, 1991. 
D.  The director may require, at any time, the destruction of a private well which causes or threatens to cause the spread of pollution or which adversely impacts the quality of ground water. 
E.  The director may implement the destruction of any well which causes or threatens to cause the spread of pollution, if the owner, operator or permittee of such well has not destroyed the well within ninety (90) days of receipt of a written notice requiring the destruction of the well. Costs incurred by the city to destroy a private well shall be the responsibility of the well's owners, operators and permittees. 
F.  The director or his designee shall have the right to enter upon any premises at all reasonable times to make inspections and tests for the purpose of enforcement and administration of this chapter. 
G.  Drilling or construction of a new private well or rehabilitation of an existing or abandoned well within the city is not permitted. New exploratory holes, cathodic protection wells, monitoring wells and contaminant extraction wells are permitted, provided all provisions of this chapter are followed, a well permit form is filed with the department of public works and approved by the director, and required fees are paid. 
(Ord. 2285 § 1, 2007: Ord. 1754 § 1, 1990: prior code § 29.4).  
8.12.050 - Exemptions. 
A.  If compliance with any of the requirements prescribed in this chapter is impractical for a particular location because of unusual conditions, or if compliance would result in construction of an unsatisfactory well, then the director may, upon written request from the well owner or permittee, waive compliance and prescribe alternative requirements which are "equal to" these standards in protection of ground water quality. Specific conditions or exemptions will be described as a variance on the permit. 
B.  The construction, maintenance, rehabilitation, modification, and destruction of monitoring wells may be performed under the statutory and regulatory requirements of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, the State Department of Health Services, the Merced County Department of Health, or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. If, on a specific site, provisions in this ordinance are in conflict with well standards prescribed by these other agencies, then the director may, upon written request from the well owner or permittee, waive compliance provided the other agency's well standards provide equal or greater protection of ground water quality. 
C.  The requirement of subsection B of Section 8.12.040 that existing private wells be destroyed, may be waived by the city upon a determination by the director of public works operations that: 
1.  The well has value for the treatment and/or monitoring of chemical or other contamination of ground water, and 
2.  The well is constructed and will be operated in a manner which will avoid further contamination of ground water; and 
3.  The city is allowed unimpeded access to the well pursuant to Section 8.12.040(F). 
D.  A waiver granted pursuant to subsection C above shall terminate upon written notice to the well owner by the director of public works operations that one or more of the above conditions no longer exists. In such event the well owner shall destroy the well within ninety (90) days of receipt of the notice. If the well has not been destroyed within said ninety (90) days, the director of public works operations may destroy the well. Costs incurred by the city to destroy the well shall be the responsibility of the well's owners, operators and permittees.

2.  A well shall be sealed with a sealing material in a manner that prevents bridging, dilution, or segregation of the grout which would prevent the material from completely filling the annular space. The suggested methods for sealing given in Appendix B of DWR Bulletin 74-8 1 are the minimum standards for this chapter. Other methods of sealing the annular space may be approved upon review by the director after reviewing a written request by the owner for an alternative method. 
3.  Sealing material shall be of a composition equivalent to those given in Section 9 of DWR Bulletin 74-8 1 as reviewed in 1988, or the latest revisions and Section 11 of DWR Bulletin 74-88 or the latest revisions. 
4.  Wells shall be constructed so the annular space is effectively sealed at the surface to protect against contamination or pollution by entrance of surface or shallow subsurface waters. At a minimum, new wells shall be sealed from the surface in accordance with the following Table 3. 
Table 3 
Minimum Depth of Surface Seal 
	
Domestic well 	50 feet

6.  Annular seal shall extend from the surface to a depth of at least three hundred feet for new wells producing water from a depth below three hundred feet. 
7.  Where a well penetrates more than one aquifer and mixing of aquifer waters in sufficient quantities will cause significant deterioration of the quality of water in one or more aquifers, then the strata producing the poor quality water shall be sealed off. New wells shall not be allowed to tap two or more separate and distinct producing zones (aquifer systems). 
8.  If any existing well producing water from both the intermediate aquifer and the Mehrten aquifer is found to be contaminated, it shall be modified to seal off the contaminated zones and to prevent mixing between aquifers or shall be destroyed. 
9.  When special conditions exist, such as known pollution, the director may prescribe additional sealing standards to prevent the migration of pollution. 
B.  Casing Materials. 
1.  All new and rehabilitated wells shall be constructed with casing materials which have sufficient strength and durability to resist the forces imposed on it during installation, including grouting and development, and which will provide structural integrity against forces which can normally be expected after installation. No thermoset or thermoplastic casing greater than eight inches in nominal diameter will be allowed below a depth of three hundred feet. 
2.  Casing material and thickness of material shall be selected in accordance with good design practices. Materials selected for the well casing shall be of a strength and durability that meets the specifications prescribed in Section 12 of Chapter II of DWR Bulletin 74-81 as revised in 1988 or the latest revision, or Section 9 of Chapter II of DWR Bulletin 74-88 or the latest revision. 
C.  Surface Construction. 
1.  All pumping equipment shall be installed with protective devices to effectively prevent entrance of foreign matter or back siphonage into the well casing. A properly designed air gap may be considered an acceptable protective device for agricultural wells. 
2.  A concrete slab or base shall be constructed around the top of all water wells. The top of the floor slab shall be sloped away from the casing. The floor slab shall be a minimum of six inches thick with the outer edge of the slab at least four inches above and at least two inches below the ground surface, The surface slab shall be tied to the well's annular surface seal. 
3.  All wells furnishing water for human consumption shall have a greaseless petcock valve with the spout facing down located on the discharge line before the storage tank for obtaining water quality samples. 
4.  Any well terminating above the ground surface in areas where vehicular traffic can occur must be identified and protected such that the well can easily be seen and protected from damage. 
5.  Where the top of a monitoring or cathodic protection well must be below the ground surface, a concrete or other water tight vault must be installed. The vault and its lid must be strong enough to support vehicular traffic. The top of the vault should be set so drainage is away from the vault. The well must be capped with a leakproof cap so water in the vault will not enter the well. The vault cover or lid must be leakproof. 
D.  Well Development. 
1.  Development or redevelopment of a well shall be done in a manner which will not cause damage to the well or cause adverse subsurface conditions that may destroy barriers to vertical movement of water, 
2.  Developing or redeveloping of a well by using explosives is prohibited unless a special variance is granted by the director. 
3.  Developing or redeveloping of a monitoring well shall be done in a manner which does not interfere with the analytical results of water quality sampling. In areas of known ground water pollution, development fluids shall be handled, stored and disposed of in accordance with all applicable state and county department of health standards and procedures. 
E.  Well Disinfection. 
1.  All well and associated equipment furnishing or in contact with potable water for domestic use shall be disinfected after construction, installation or repair of the well, pump or storage equipment and before use of the water or return of the well to operation.

F.  Water Sampling. 
1.  Before, and then annually thereafter, a new or rehabilitated well for domestic use is placed into service, samples shall be collected and analyzed for chemical and bacteriological constituents and the results filed with the director. The director shall specify which chemical and bacteriological constituents are to be sampled and analyzed and specify the method of analysis, At a minimum all such wells shall meet state standards for large systems as defined by the California Code of Regulations, Title 22, as amended. 
2.  Samples for water quality analyses shall be collected from the discharge line before the storage tank. 
3.  Water samples shall be collected by persons trained and knowledgeable in the sampling procedures and chain-of-custody requirement for the constituents being analyzed. 
4.  Analysis of water samples shall be performed by a laboratory which is certified by the State Department of Health to perform the method of analysis specified by the director. 
(Ord. 1754 § 1, 1990).  
8.12.330 - Well abandonment and destruction. 
A.  All abandoned wells, exploration holes or test wells, as defined by DWR Bulletin 74-81 as revised in 1988 or the latest revision, shall be destroyed in such a manner that they will not produce water or act as a conduit for mixing or otherwise transferring of water between permeable zones or aquifers, and will not be a hazard to the safety and well being of people or animals. 
B.  Materials used to fill a well shall have a low permeability. Materials shall meet the material standards prescribed in DWR Bulletin 74-81 as revised in 1988, and DWR Bulletin 74-88 or the latest revision. 
C.  Wells penetrating the Corcoran Clay shall be destroyed in a manner that ensures a seal is placed across the Corcoran Clay. If necessary, the casing shall be perforated for an interval of not less than ten feet and sealing material forced under pressure into the annular space. 
D.  Wells penetrating deeper than three hundred feet shall be destroyed in a manner that ensures a seal is placed across the three hundred foot clay. If necessary, the casing shall be perforated for an interval of not less than ten feet and sealing material forced under pressure into the annular space. 
E.  Wells without an upper annular seal equal to or greater than that set forth in Table 3 shall perforate the casing at a depth equal to Table 3 and inject sealing material under pressure into the annular space. 
F.  In areas where ground water pollution is known, the director may prescribe special methods for well destruction to prevent the migration of pollutants. 
G.  Any well, exploratory hole or test hole which is abandoned, out of service, or otherwise left unattended shall have a temporary cover over the well or hold opening which prevents the introduction of undesirable material into the well or hole, and ensures public safety. The cover shall be secured in such a manner that it cannot be removed except with the aid of equipment or through the use of tools. 
H.  The owner or permittee of any well, exploratory hole or test hole which is abandoned, out of service, or otherwise left unattended for a period greater than ninety days shall file with the director a letter of intent which provides the reason(s) for not properly destroying the well, exploratory hole or test hole as required by this chapter and which specifies the time when the well, exploratory hole, or test hole will be completed, put back in service, or destroyed as required in this chapter.

Footnotes:

Editor's note Ord. No. 2484, § 1, adopted January 2, 2017, amended the Code by repealing former ch. 8.28, §§ 8.28-0108.28.230. Former ch. 8.28 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2456, § 1, adopted April 18, 2016.

8.28.020 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards and regulations for the installation and use of alarm systems to reduce the needless and frequent occurrence of police responses to false alarms occurring at commercial, residential, and other facilities or structures within the city. The increasing frequency of police responses to false alarm calls constitutes a hazard to police officers and the public, and also inhibits the ability of the police department to respond to other emergencies to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city. Police resources within the city are limited and the unnecessary responses to false alarms diverts valuable police resources and results in substantial costs to the city each year. The regulation of alarm systems is necessary to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by discouraging false alarms.

The city's total abatement costs may also be collected as a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates, and upon recordation in the office of the county recorder of the County of Merced of a notice of lien, as so made and confirmed shall constitute a special assessment on the property for the amount of the assessment. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes.

(a)  That the property may be sold after three (3) years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments and that the tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. 
(b)  That the assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and the sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. 
(c)  That if the property is sold to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date to which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, the cost of abatement shall not be a lien against the real property, but shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
E.  Satisfaction. In the event that the lien or special assessment is discharged, released, or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, a notice of the discharge containing the information specified in the lien shall be recorded by the city. 
F.  Fees. Any fees incurred by the city for processing, recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner may be recovered by the city as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.

However, recovery of attorney's fees shall only be available to those individual actions or proceedings in which the city elects, at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorney's fees. In no action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding shall an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding.

The enforcement officer or his/her authorized representative shall further have the authority to summarily stop all work on, and/or suspend any and all permits applicable to, the property and/or the subdivision under development in which the property is located, until the condition or use of the property that constitutes or reasonably appears to cause or constitute an imminent or immediate danger to the health or safety of the public or a significant portion thereof is abated.

If no address of any such person so appears or is not otherwise known, then a copy of the summary abatement report shall be so mailed, addressed to such person(s), at the address of the subject premises. The failure of the enforcement officer to serve any person required herein to be served shall not invalidate any proceedings hereunder as to any other person duly served or relieve any such person from any duty or obligation imposed by the provisions of the Municipal Code or any other applicable statute, rule, code or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 2349, § 1, 3-1-2010)

Chapter 8.50 - FORECLOSED AND VACANT HOMES 
Sections: 
 
8.50.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  The city council finds that foreclosed and abandoned residential properties pose a risk to the public peace, health and safety of the citizens of the City of Merced. The detrimental effects from the lack of security and maintenance of foreclosed and abandoned residential properties include dangerous attractive nuisances, increased opportunities for crimes such as squatting, vandalism and burglaries, discouraging buyers from purchasing neighboring homes, lowering property values, and physical and economical blight. 
B.  The purpose of this chapter is to utilize the procedures set forth in California Civil Code Section 2929.3 to prevent the detrimental effects associated with foreclosed and abandoned residential properties.* 
C.  It is the purpose and intent of this chapter that the problem conditions identified in subsections A and B above and Civil Code Section 2929.3 be abated and compliance with the Municipal Code be accomplished rather than to have fines imposed. Every effort should be made to achieve compliance rather than to impose fines. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009) 
* California Civil Code § 2929.3 will be repealed on January 1, 2013, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 2013, deletes or extends that date.  
8.50.020 - Requirement to maintain vacant residential property. 
A.  A legal owner shall maintain vacant residential property purchased by that owner at a foreclosure sale, or acquired by that owner through foreclosure under a mortgage or deed of trust. 
B.  A legal owner's failure to maintain property under this chapter shall subject that owner to fines under this chapter. "Failure to maintain" is defined as: 
1.  Failure to care for the exterior of the property, including, but not limited to, permitting excessive foliage growth that diminishes the value of surrounding properties; 
2.  Failing to take action to prevent trespassers or squatters from remaining on the property; 
3.  Failing to take action to prevent mosquito larvae from growing in standing water; or 
4.  Other conditions that create a public nuisance under Title 8 of this Code or under state law. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009)  
8.50.030 - Imposition of fine. 
In any proceeding under this chapter, the city may impose a civil fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each day that the legal owner fails to maintain the property in violation of this chapter, commencing on the day following the expiration of the period to remedy the violation established in the notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009)  
8.50.040 - Notice to legal owner of violation, imposition of fine, and hearing. 
A.  Whenever an enforcement officer, as defined in Section 8.08.030 of this Code, determines that a violation of the requirement to maintain property under this chapter has occurred, the enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue a "Notice to Legal Owner of Violation, Imposition of Fine, and Hearing." This notice shall be referred to as "notice to legal owner" in this chapter. 
B.  The Notice to legal owner shall include a description of the conditions giving rise to the violation and notice of the city's intent to assess a civil fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day if action to correct the violation is not commenced within a period of not less than fourteen (14) days and completed within a period of not less than thirty (30) days. This period shall be referred to as the "compliance period." Notwithstanding this, a compliance period of less than thirty (30) days to remedy the violation may be required before imposing a fine if it is determined that a specific condition on the property threatens public health or safety. In that event, the notice to legal owner shall specifically state such determination and the lesser period for compliance. An enforcement officer may establish different compliance periods for different violations, subject to the minimums set forth in this section. 
C.  The notice to legal owner shall include the date, time, and place of a hearing at which time the legal owner shall be given an opportunity to contest any fine imposed. The hearing shall generally be set by the enforcement officer approximately thirty (30) days following expiration of the compliance period set forth in the notice to legal owner. 
D.  The notice to legal owner shall advise that fines will continue to accrue unless and until the enforcement officer inspects the property and issues a compliance certificate which the legal owner must produce at the hearing. In the event there is a delay of more than twenty-four (24) hours between the request for a reinspection and the reinspection, the fine shall be tolled between the date of the request for reinspection and the actual reinspection. It is the responsibility for the legal owner to arrange for such inspection and to obtain the compliance certificate. The notice to legal owner shall include contact information for the inspection and for the compliance certificate. 
E.  The notice to legal owner shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address provided in the deed or other instrument as specified in Government Code Section 27321.5(a), or, if none, to the return address on the deed or other instrument. Whenever a notice to legal owner is required to be provided to the legal owner, a copy thereof shall also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the "responsible person." The phrase "responsible person" for purposes of this chapter and this chapter only shall mean that individual who has signed up with the city to receive city-provided utility services. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009)  
8.50.050 - Hearing. 
A.  The hearing shall be set and conducted regardless of whether the hearing was requested by the legal owner or responsible person. If the legal owner, representative of the legal owner, or responsible person, fails to appear for the hearing, the hearing officer will conduct the hearing to a conclusion and issue a decision as set forth in this chapter. Failure to appear at the hearing shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for purposes of judicial review. 
B.  The hearing officer shall have the power to administer oaths. 
C.  At the hearing, the city shall present evidence in support of the notice to legal owner and imposition of fine(s). The legal owner, or any individual authorized in writing to represent the legal owner, including a responsible person, may present evidence in opposition to the notice to legal owner and/or imposition of fine(s). 
D.  The hearing shall be conducted informally. The rules of evidence shall not apply, except that irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded in the hearing officer's decision. 
E.  The city shall bear the burden of proof, which shall be preponderance of the evidence. 
F.  The city shall maintain the administrative record of the hearing. 
G.  If the property has a responsible person in addition to a legal owner, the hearing officer shall consider, in assessing the amount of the fine, if any, whether or not the responsible person was provided notice as required herein as well as how long the responsible person has been registered with the city as the responsible person for the property. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009)  
8.50.060 - Decision after hearing. 
A.  The hearing officer shall file a written decision with the city clerk within seventy-two (72) hours of the hearing. The decision shall include a statement of the issues, findings of fact, a summary of relevant evidence and an order setting the amount of the fine. In determining the amount of the fine, the hearing officer shall take into consideration any timely and good faith efforts by legal owner to remedy the violation(s). 
B.  The city clerk shall mail a notice of decision by certified mail with an attached copy of the hearing officer's decision to the legal owner at the address as set forth above in Section 8.50.040(E) of this Code and to any other address if requested by the legal owner. 
C.  The city's notice of decision shall provide as follows: 
1.  Contain a statement that the decision is final and that judicial review may be sought within twenty (20) days pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.4. 
2.  Advise that the total of the fines charged will become a lien against the property if not paid within forty-five (45) days of the notice of decision. 
3.  Notify the legal owner that fines will continue to accumulate if the violations are not abated following the hearing and that the legal owner and the responsible person, if any, shall be notified of the time and place of a subsequent hearing at which additional fines under this chapter may be imposed if the violation(s) is/are not abated. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009)  
8.50.070 - Recovery of fines; liens and special assessments on property. 
Any fine imposed by a hearing officer's decision under this chapter shall be the personal obligation of legal owner and may become a lien on the property if not paid within forty-five (45) days of the decision. Such lien may be collected in the same time and manner as property taxes are collected as set forth in this Code regarding recovery of fees, costs, charges, and fines relating to public nuisances, except to the extent modified herein. It is the intent of the city council in adopting this chapter to hold financial institutions and investors in foreclosed and/or vacant property accountable for the conditions of their property. In no instance shall a financial institution require a real estate agent or broker to advance the funds to satisfy the fine or clear any lien imposed and any financial institution requiring the same shall be in violation of this Code by committing a misdemeanor subject to punishment in accordance with Chapter 1.12 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009)  
8.50.080 - Cumulative remedies. 
All rights and remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law. All procedures herein are intended to obtain the abatement of public nuisances and compliance with those provisions of the city's Code which are declared to be public nuisances. 
(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 6-1-2009)  
8.50.090 - Fines collected by city. 
Fines imposed under this chapter shall be payable to the City of Merced and shall be directed to the city's code enforcement budget for nuisance abatement purposes.

C.  The city engineer may also place and maintain such additional traffic-control devices as he may deem necessary to regulate traffic or to guide or warn traffic, but he shall make such determination only upon the basis of safety requirements, of traffic engineering principles and traffic investigations and in accordance with such standards, limitations and rules as may be set forth in the traffic ordinances or resolutions of this city or as may be determined by ordinance or resolution of the city council. 
(Prior code § 16.24).  
10.20.020 - Traffic laws unenforceable unless signs posted.

(Prior code § 16.26).  
10.20.040 - Location and installation of traffic signals. 
A.

B.  The city engineer shall ascertain and determine the locations where such signals are required by resorting to field observation, traffic counts, and other traffic information as may be pertinent and his determinations therefrom shall be made in accordance with those traffic engineering and safety standards and instructions set forth in the traffic manual. 
(Ord. 2279 § 2, 2007: prior code § 16.27).

(Prior code § 16.29).  
10.20.070 - No driving markings. 
Whenever the state department of public works determines by resolution and designates a distinctive roadway marking which indicates no driving over such markings, the chief of police and city engineer are authorized to designate by such marking those streets or parts of streets where the volume of traffic or the vertical or other curvature of the roadway renders it hazardous to drive on the left side of such markings or signs and markings. Such markings or signs and markings shall have the same effect as similar markings placed by the state department of public works pursuant to the provisions of the state Vehicle Code. 
(Prior code § 16.30).  
10.20.080 - Removal and relocation authority. 
The city engineer is authorized to remove, relocate or discontinue the operation of any traffic-control device not specifically required by the state law, this chapter or other ordinance or resolution of the city whenever it is determined in any particular case that the conditions which warranted or required the installation no longer exist or pertain. 
(Prior code § 16.31).  
10.20.090 - Hours of operation. 
The chief of police and city engineer shall determine the hours and days during which any traffic-control device shall be in operation or be in effect, except in those cases where such hours or days are specified in this chapter or other ordinance or resolution of this city.

10.20.120 - Restricted turn signsAuthority. 
The chief of police and city engineer are authorized to determine those intersections at which drivers of vehicles shall not make a right, left or U-turn and shall place proper signs at such intersections. The making of such turn may be prohibited between certain hours of any day and permitted at other hours, in which event the same shall be plainly indicated on the signs or they may be removed when such turns are permitted. 
(Prior code § 16.35).  
10.20.130 - Restricted turn signsObedience.

(Prior code § 16.37).  
10.20.150 - Stop signs. 
Whenever any ordinance or resolution of this city designates and describes any street or portion thereof as a through street, or any intersection at which vehicles are required to stop at one (1) or more entrances thereto, or any railroad grade crossing at which vehicles are required to stop, the city engineer shall erect and maintain stop signs as follows: 
A stop sign shall be erected on each and every street intersecting such through street or portion thereof so designated and at those entrances of other intersections where a stop is required and at any railroad grade crossing so designated. Every such sign shall conform with and shall be placed as provided in Chapter 2, Article 1, Sections 21350 through 21355 of the California Vehicle Code. 
(Ord. 2316 § 21, 2008: prior code § 16.38).  
10.20.160 - Traffic control devices on private roads. 
The city council, by ordinance or resolution, and in accordance with law, may prescribe the erection of traffic control devices on a private road or driveway at designated locations, and when such traffic control devices have been so installed, it is unlawful for any person to disobey any such traffic control device. 
(Prior code § 16.38.1).  
10.20.170 - WarrantsGenerally. 
The city engineer shall install and maintain traffic control devices, including but not limited to traffic signals, stop signals and yield right-of-way signs at any location, but only when the traffic and other conditions meet the warrants as set forth in this chapter and in the traffic manual. 
(Prior code § 16.200).  
10.20.180 - WarrantsSchool crossings. 
Traffic control measures for school crossing protection shall be in accordance with the traffic manual, except that the first sentence of Section 10-07.3 of the traffic manual, as adopted (Warrants for Assignment of Adult Crossing Guards) shall be deemed to read as follows: 
Adult crossing guards normally are assigned where official supervision of elementary school children is desirable while they cross a public street or highway, and at least forty elementary school age pedestrians in the fourth grade or under utilize the crossing on the way to or from school. 
(Ord. 1844 § 4, 1993: prior code § 16.201).  
10.20.190 - WarrantsStop signs. 
Minimum warrants for installation of stop signs are: 
A.  On a street entering a legally established through highway or street; 
B.  On a minor street when the ability to see all potentially conflicting traffic is insufficient to allow a road user traveling at the posted speed, or the statutory speed (whichever speed is greater) to pass through the intersection or to stop in a reasonably safe manner; 
C.

The above notwithstanding, at least ten days before any news rack is removed under this subsection, the persons responsible for its installation or maintenance shall be given written notice pursuant to this section that such news rack is suspected of being abandoned.

A.  Amounts collected as provided in Section 15.08.130 (excluding the 0.15 fee for administration and collection) shall be paid by the city to the applicant who paid the cost of installing the main until the applicant has received an amount calculated as "R" in the following formula: 
R = T - (0.60 × C × F), where: 
1.  T equals cost of installing the sewer line; 
2.  C equals cost per foot of installing the sewer line; 
3.  F equals number of feet of installing applicant's property fronting on main. 
B.  When the city engineer has determined that only one side of a street can be benefited and has made collections on that basis, amounts so collected (excluding the.0.15 fee for administration and collection) shall be paid by the city to the applicant who paid the cost of installing the sewer line until said applicant has received an amount calculated as "R" in the following formula: 
R = T - (1.20 × C × F), where: 
1.  T equals total cost of installing the sewer line; 
2.  C equals cost per foot of installing sewer line;

If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using analytical methods approved by EPA, California Department of Health Services, or the California State Water Resources Control Board. 
B.  Samples collected to satisfy the reporting requirements in this chapter must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
C.  Except as indicated in subsections (a) and (b) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
a.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
b.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For periodic reports on continued compliance and reports for significant industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards, the user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

A.  Grease interceptors shall be maintained in efficient operating condition by periodic removal of the full contents of the interceptor, which includes wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge and solids. 
B.  All grease interceptors shall be maintained in a manner consistent with the maintenance frequency approved by the city engineer. 
C.  All grease interceptors are required to have grease retention fittings as designed for proper function. Any interceptor that does not have the grease retention fittings shall be repaired and/or retrofitted with appropriate grease retention fittings. 
D.  No FOG that has accumulated in a grease interceptor shall be allowed to pass into any sewer lateral, public sewer, storm drain or public right-of-way, or onto the surface of any street or parking area. 
E.  The city engineer may require any FSE with a grease interceptor to submit data and information necessary to establish the required maintenance frequency of the grease interceptor. 
F.  The required maintenance frequency for every FSE with a grease interceptor shall be determined by the city engineer by one (1) of the following methods: 
1.  Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned at a frequency such that the combined FOG and solids accumulation in the grease interceptor does not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total designed hydraulic depth of the grease interceptor. This is to ensure that the minimum hydraulic retention time and required available hydraulic volume is maintained to effectively intercept and retain FOG from being discharged to the public sewer. 
2.  Every FSE with a grease interceptor shall fully pump out and clean its grease interceptor not less than once every six (6) months. 
3.  Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned quarterly when the frequency described in subsection (F)(1) has not been established. The maintenance frequency shall be adjusted when sufficient data has been obtained to establish an average frequency based on the requirements described in subsection (F)(1) and guidelines adopted by the city pursuant to the FOG control program. The city may change the required maintenance frequency at any time to reflect changes in actual operating conditions in accordance with the FOG control program. Based on the actual generation of FOG from the FSE, the required maintenance frequency may increase or decrease. 
4.  The owner, operator or FOG WDP permittee of an FSE may submit a request to the city engineer for a change in the required maintenance frequency at any time. The FSE has the burden of demonstrating that the requested change in frequency reflects actual operating conditions based on the average FOG accumulation over time and meets the requirements described in subsection (F)(1), and that it is in full compliance with the conditions of its FOG WDP and this chapter. Upon a determination by the city engineer that the requested revision is justified, the FOG WDP shall be revised accordingly to reflect the change in required maintenance frequency. 
5.  If the grease interceptor, at any time, contains FOG and solids accumulation exceeding the requirements described in subsection (F)(1), the FSE shall be required to have the grease interceptor serviced immediately such that all FOG and other materials are completely removed from the grease interceptor. If deemed necessary, the city engineer may also increase the required maintenance frequency of the grease interceptor. 
G.  Wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge/solids, and other materials removed from the grease interceptor shall be disposed of by waste haulers at an approved disposal site in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and/or local laws. 
H.  The city engineer may direct city staff or a city contractor to pump and clean an FSE's grease interceptor if the FSE has failed to comply with the terms of this chapter. The FSE owner and property owner shall be jointly and severally responsible for any and all expenses of the city in undertaking such work, and such expenses are deemed a debt of the FSE owner and the property owner to the city, enforceable and collectible as provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 2402, § 6, 12-17-2012)  
15.30.100 - Variance and waiver of grease interceptor requirements. 
A.  Variance From Grease Interceptor Requirements. An FSE may request that the city engineer grant a variance from the grease interceptor requirements in Section 15.30.070 to allow for the installation of an alternative grease control device in lieu of a grease interceptor, if the FSE demonstrates that the alternative grease control device equals or exceeds the effectiveness of a grease interceptor, and that it is impossible or impracticable to install, operate or maintain a grease interceptor. The city engineer's determination to grant a variance will be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor. 
2.  There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and the private collection lines or the public sewer. 
3.  The FSE can prove that the alternative grease control device is equally or more effective than a grease interceptor in controlling its FOG discharge. In addition, the FSE must be able to demonstrate, after installation of the proposed alternative grease control device its effectiveness to control FOG discharge through downstream visual monitoring of the public sewer, for at least three (3) months at its own expense. A variance may be granted if the results show no visible accumulation of FOG in the FSE's sewer lateral and/or tributary downstream sewer lines. Any variance issued pursuant to this section may be revoked at any time in the discretion of the city engineer. 
B.  Conditional Waiver of Requirement to Install Grease Interceptor. A conditional waiver of the requirement to install a grease interceptor may be granted for FSEs that the city engineer determines to have negligible FOG discharges and an insignificant impact to the public sewer. Although a waiver from installation of a grease interceptor may be granted, the FSE may be required to provide space and plumbing segregation for future installation of a grease interceptor. The city engineer's determination to grant or revoke a conditional waiver shall be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  Quantity of FOG discharges as measured or indicated by the size of the FSE based on water usage, menu, seating capacity, number of meals served, amount of on-site consumption of prepared food, number of plumbing fixtures and other conditions that may reasonably be shown to contribute to FOG discharges. 
2.  Adequacy of implementation of BMPs and compliance history. 
3.  Sewer size, grade, condition based on visual and other information, FOG deposition in the sewer by the FSE, and history of maintenance and SSOs caused by FOG from the FSE. 
4.  Changes in operations that significantly affect FOG discharge. 
5.  Any other condition that the city engineer deems reasonably related to the generation of FOG discharges. 
C.  Waiver of Grease Interceptor Installation Requirement With a Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee. Where the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible and no equivalent alternative grease control device can be installed, an FSE may be granted a waiver of the grease interceptor requirement upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee as described in Section 15.30.120. Additional requirements may also be imposed to mitigate the discharge of FOG into the public sewer. The city engineer's determination to grant the waiver upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee will be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  There is inadequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor. 
2.  There is inadequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor and/or between the grease interceptor and the sewer lateral or the public sewer. 
3.  The FSE does not qualify for a variance from the requirement to install a grease interceptor pursuant to subsection A. 
D.  Application for Variance or Waiver of Grease Interceptor Installation Requirements. An FSE may submit to the City of Merced Industrial Waste Division an application for a waiver or variance from the grease interceptor requirements in Section 15.30.070. The FSE bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible or otherwise required. Upon determination by the city engineer that issuance of a variance or waiver is justified, the city engineer will issue or revise the FOG WDP to include the variance or waiver and relieve the FSE from the grease interceptor requirements. 
E.  Terms and Conditions of Variance or Waiver. A variance or waiver shall contain the terms and conditions that serve as the basis for its issuance. A variance or waiver may be revoked by the city engineer at any time upon his or her determination that any of the terms or conditions for its issuance are not satisfied or if the conditions upon which the variance or waiver was based have changed so that the justification for the variance or waiver no longer exists. Unless the variance or waiver is revoked pursuant to this paragraph, the variance or waiver shall be valid until the expiration date specified in the variance or waiver.

15.30.120 - Grease disposal mitigation fee. 
Any FSE that operates without a grease interceptor or other grease control device approved by the city may be required to pay an annual grease disposal mitigation fee to equitably cover the costs of increased maintenance of the public sewer as a result of the FSE's inability to adequately remove FOG from its wastewater discharge. This section shall not be interpreted to allow new construction or an existing FSE undergoing remodeling and/or a change in operations to operate without an approved grease interceptor unless the city engineer has determined that it is impossible or impracticable for the FSE to install and/or operate a grease interceptor under Section 15.30.100 of this chapter. 
A.  The grease disposal mitigation fee shall be established annually by the city engineer, and shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining the public sewer for inspection and removal of FOG and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the FSE resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor. 
B.  The grease disposal mitigation fee may be waived or reduced, not more frequently than annually, if the FSE demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city engineer that the FSE has used BMPs and waste minimization practices on a regular basis that have significantly reduced the introduction of FOG into the public sewer. 
C.  The grease disposal mitigation fee may not be waived or reduced if the FSE does not comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter and/or its discharge into the public sewer has caused or potentially caused or contributed to, alone or collectively, sewer blockage or SSOs in the sewer downstream or in the area surrounding the FSE, in the twelve (12) months prior to the waiver request.

B.  The city manager shall adopt administrative guidelines to provide procedures for payment and collection, including delinquency and termination, of municipal utility services in the city's Administrative Policy and Procedure Manual. 
C.  Under no circumstances shall the city be required to make service available to a residential occupant unless each residential occupant or representative of the residential occupants agrees to the terms and conditions of service, and meets the requirements of law and the city's rules and regulations. However, if one or more of the residential occupants or the representative of the residential occupant is willing and able to assume responsibility for subsequent charges to the account to the satisfaction of the city, or if there is a physical means legally available to the city of selectively terminating services to those residential occupants who have not met the requirements of the city's rules or for whom the representative of the residential occupants is not responsible, the city shall make service available to the residential occupants who have met those requirements or on whose behalf those requirements have been met. Additionally, those residential occupants shall be required to comply with the same deposit requirements as set forth in Section 15.32.165.

This estimate shall be based upon the size of the service, the nature of the use of the property and the experience with other similar uses in the city. Failure to make the deposit will warrant the discontinuation of service. 
B.  The decision of the city to require a new residential applicant to deposit a sum of money with the city prior to establishing an account and furnishing service shall be based solely on the credit worthiness of the applicant as determined by the city. 
(Ord. 1958 § 8, 1997: Ord. 1752 § 17, 1990).

B.  The review shall include consideration of whether the customer shall be permitted to amortize the unpaid balance of the account over a reasonable period of time, not to exceed twelve (12) months. No termination of service shall be effected for any account under review or for any customer who complies with a written amortization agreement, and keeps the account current as charges accrue in each subsequent billing period. 
C.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city manager may appeal to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal within five (5) calendar days of the decision with the city clerk setting forth his objections. After hearing the objections by such person and giving due consideration thereto, the city council shall make its decision on the matters contained in the appeal, and its decision shall be final and conclusive.

The notification shall include information on what is required to prevent termination of service. The residential customer shall make a request for third party notification on a form provided by the city, and shall include the written consent of the designated third party. The third party notification does not obligate the third party to pay the overdue charges nor shall it prevent or delay termination of service.

15.36.110 - ConnectionFor replacement and relocation. 
When an existing water service connection is replaced by one of a larger size, or where it is necessary to relocate a water service for the convenience of a customer, or where relocation is required because the customer's construction will interfere with the operation or maintenance of the service connection, the charge for such replacement or relocation shall be the cost for labor, equipment and materials as the same is determined by the city engineer. 
(Ord. 1174 § 2 (part), 1976: prior code § 31.4(b)).  
15.36.120 - ConnectionTap and service size. 
The size of the tap and service connection installed by any customer shall be as the city engineer may designate. 
(Ord. 1174 § 2 (part), 1976: prior code § 31.4(c)).  
15.36.130 - ConnectionSubdivisions. 
A.  Five or More Lots. The city will not provide water distribution lines or connection services to newly developing subdivisions of five or more lots. The subdivider or developer will arrange to have the water services installed at his expense upon furnishing proof that the work will be done in its entirety by a duly licensed and competent person in accordance with city standards. 
B.  Less than Five Lots. The city may elect, at its option, to install water services to newly developing subdivisions of four lots or fewer. Such installations will be accomplished at the expense of the developer or applicant.

(Ord. 1174 § 2 (part), 1976: prior code § 31.4(e)).  
15.36.150 - ConnectionDetermination. 
The city council may, by ordinance or resolution, establish the costs to be charged for installation of water service by the city. If no such ordinance or resolution is in effect, or if the ordinance or resolution in effect does not cover a given size, class or type of water connection, the charge for water service installation performed by the city shall be determined by the city engineer, based upon actual costs, including, but not limited to, labor, materials, and equipment. In those instances where, in the judgment of the city engineer, the best interest of the city would be served, the applicant for water service connection may be required to deposit with the city the estimated cost of such installation, prior to performance of such installation. 
(Ord. 1174 § 2 (part), 1976: prior code § 31.4(f)).  
15.36.160 - ConnectionMajor water facilities. 
A.  Each property owner who applies for connection of any building or premises to the city water system, or who applies for replacement of an existing water service connection with one (1) of larger size, shall, prior to issuance of the permit for such connection or replacement, pay to the city a major water facilities charge, based upon the size of the water service required for such building or premises. Each quarter, the major water facilities charge shall be adjusted by an amount equal to the percent change in the All Urban Consumers Index, U.S. City Average (USCA), as supplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The amount of such major water facilities charge shall be computed as follows: 
Major Water Facility Charge 	= 	Current Quarter CPI 
   (USCA)

Chapter 15.40 - WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS 
 
15.40.010 - Generally. 
Water mains may be extended by an applicant in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city engineer and meeting "Standards of Minimum Requirements for Safe Practices in the Production and Delivery of Water for Domestic Use" of the California section of the American Water Works Association (California Health and Safety Code, Section 4010.5). The construction work shall be performed by a properly licensed contractor. Prior to approval of the plans and specifications, a deposit for engineering and inspection costs equal to three percent of the estimated cost of installation shall be deposited with the city before the applicant begins such work. Upon completion of the work, the finance officer shall determine the actual costs incurred by city in support of such work. Final inspection acceptance of the work shall be withheld until all moneys due the city are paid. In the event the deposit exceeds the actual cost incurred by city, the difference shall be refunded to the applicant. 
(Ord. 1223 § 7, 1978: prior code § 31.14).  
15.40.020 - City may perform work. 
If the proposed water main extension is to serve a developed or populated area, the city may elect to perform the extension work. 
(Prior code § 31.15).  
15.40.030 - Along full frontageException. 
Where a water main is to be extended to serve a parcel of land, the water line shall extend the full frontage of the parcel, unless it is determined by the director that the line is not likely to be extended to serve any other property. 
(Prior code § 31.16).  
15.40.040 - Line diameter. 
The inside diameter of every water line to be installed shall be not less than six inches, except as may be determined by the director. 
(Prior code § 31.17).  
15.40.050 - Required bonds. 
In the event the applicant installs water line extension facilities, he shall furnish the city with a corporate surety bond written by a company approved by the city, in an amount equal to at least one-half of the estimate made by the applicant's engineer of the installation costs, to guarantee faithful performance by the applicant, and a like surety bond in an equal amount to guarantee claims of persons employed by the applicant and claims of persons who furnish materials, supplies and implements used by the applicant on such work. 
(Prior code § 31.18).  
15.40.060 - Ownership. 
When water lines are installed in public streets or easements pursuant to the regulations of the city and have been accepted by the director, they become the property of the city and a part of the water system of the city. 
(Prior code § 31.19).  
15.40.070 - Extension costCollection from subsequent applicant. 
A.  Whenever an applicant applies for a permit to connect property fronting a water line, the installation cost of which was paid by a previous applicant or the city, such applicant shall pay to the city, prior to the granting of such permit, an amount calculated as "A" in the following formula: 
A = F × C × 0.75, where: 
1.  F equals the number of feet of applicant's property fronting on water line. 
2.  C equals the cost per foot of installing the water line. 
3.  0.75 equals the factor composed of 0.50 (for one of the two sides fronting on water line), 0.10 (for street intersection allowance, and 0.15 (for administration and collection of the fee). 
B.  When the director determines that only one side of a street can be benefited by a water line installed by a previous applicant or city, subsequent applicants for permits to connect thereto shall pay to the city, prior to the granting of such permits, an amount calculated as "A" in the following formula: 
A = F × C × 1.35, where: 
1.  F equals the number of feet of applicant's property fronting on water line. 
2.  C equals the cost per foot of installing the water line. 
3.  1.35 equals a factor composed of 1.00 (the total cost of the installation), 0.20 (for street intersection allowance), and 0.15 (for administration and collection of the fee). 
C.  Notwithstanding subsections A and B above, an applicant shall not owe an extension fee if the water line was installed by a previous applicant over ten years prior to the date of applicant's application, or if the water line was installed through an assessment district or solely with state or federal grant monies. 
D.  Amounts collected as provided in this section (excluding the 0.15 fee for administration and collection) shall be paid by the city to the applicant who paid the cost of installing such main until such applicant has received an amount calculated as "R" in the following formula: 
R = T (0.60 × C × F), where: 
1.  T equals costs of installing water line; 
2.  C equals cost per foot of installing water line; and 
3.  F equals the number of feet of applicant's property fronting on water line. 
E.  When the city engineer has determined that only one side of a street can be benefited and has made collections on that basis, amounts so collected (excluding the 0.15 fee for administration and collection) shall be paid by the city to the applicant who paid the cost of installing such water line until such applicant has received an amount calculated as "R" in the following formula: 
R = T (1.20 × C × F), where: 
1.  T equals total cost of installing water line; 
2.  C equals cost per foot of installing water line; and 
3.  F equals the number of feet of applicant's property fronting on water line. 
(Ord. 2042 § 3, 2000: Ord. 1666 § 3, 1987: prior code § 31.20).  
15.40.080 - Extension cost refundsTime limitations. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided under subsection B, for lines installed by applicants, the city shall not make refunds to the installing applicants after the tenth anniversary of the date the water line was accepted by the city. 
B.  For lines installed pursuant to the Contract for Water and Sewer Services Between the City of Merced and the Regents of the University of California, recorded as Document No. 2003-028581 in the official records of the county of Merced, the city shall not make refunds to the University of California, Merced after the thirtieth anniversary of the date of the contract, entered into as of March 17, 2003. 
(Ord. 2167 § 8, 2004: Ord. 1666 § 2, 1987: prior code § 31.21).  
15.40.090 - Cost refundsOversize. 
A water line more than eight inches in diameter is considered oversize, and the city shall pay directly to the installing applicant the difference in cost between the average cost of installing an eight-inch diameter water line and the actual cost of installing the oversize water line; provided, that the installing applicant does not need more than an eight-inch diameter water line to serve his own premises. The city shall determine the average cost of installing an eight-inch diameter water line, and its findings shall be conclusive. 
(Prior code § 31.22).  
15.40.110 - Payment. 
Applicants subject to the charge identified in Section 15.40.070 shall pay such charge prior to obtaining the permit to connect the property to the water line, except that if the line and/or laterals are installed by the city and the applicant is to connect a single-family residence to the water line and the residence is, or will be owner occupied by a median-income family as determined by the income limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or its successor, then the applicant may elect to pay the charge in twenty (20) annual installments, plus interest thereon on the unpaid balance. Interest shall be calculated on an annual basis based on the previous year's average interest rate earned on city investments. Applicants who make the election shall execute a promissory note and deed of trust evidencing the debt to the city. 
(Ord. 1844 § 5, 1993: Ord. 1666 § 1, 1987).

2.  Any person subject to a construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Enforcement Official prior to, or as a condition of, a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, grading permit, or development or improvement plan, upon inspection of the facility, during any enforcement proceeding or action, or for any other reasonable cause. Prior to issuance of a construction permit or approval of the proposed improvement plans, for projects subject to the state's current Construction NPDES general permit, the waste discharger identification (WDID) number and the SWPPP shall be submitted to the city. For projects with less than an acre of soil disturbance or not subject to the construction general permit, an erosion and sediment control plan must be submitted to the city. 
C.  Development. The enforcement official may require controls as appropriate to minimize the long-term, post-construction activity discharge of storm water pollutants from new development(s) or modifications to existing development(s). Controls may include source control measures to prevent pollution of storm water, treatment controls designed to remove pollutants from storm water, low impact development measures, and/or hydromodification measures to offset the difference between the pre and post-construction peak flow runoff rates and volumes. Proponents of all applicable development and redevelopment projects will be required to meet the requirements and design standards specified in the current State of California Phase II MS4 NPDES Permit and as described in further detail in the city's Storm Water Design Standards Manual. 
At the earliest planning stages, project proponents shall assess and evaluate how site conditions, such as soils, vegetation, and flow paths will influence the placement of buildings and paved surfaces. The evaluation will be used to optimize the site layout to meet the goals of capturing and treating runoff. Each project proponent will submit a map of the project dividing the site into discrete drainage management areas to show in each how runoff will be managed using site design measures, source controls, treatment controls, and hydromodification measures as defined by the current MS4 permit. All site design measures, source controls, treatment controls, and hydromodification measures must be selected, sized, and situated in accordance with the guidance provided in the current MS4 permit and the city's Storm Water Design Standards Manual. Documentation of the site's post-construction storm water design measures must be submitted to the city engineer for review and approval prior to the commencement of the project. 
Project proponents must sign an operation and maintenance agreement in which they legally bind themselves to maintain the installed post-construction design measures in an effective and good operational condition until the property ownership is transferred. A written operation and maintenance plan for the proposed storm water design measures is required to be submitted to and approved by the city with the signed agreement. The agreement will be recorded with the deed by the city clerk making it transferrable to the new owner; or, when there are multiple property owners responsible for the maintenance of the control measures, the agreement will consist of a legally binding covenant between the city and the homeowners association or maintenance district. The owner or association responsible for the maintenance of the control measures may be required by the city to submit an annual self-certification that the storm water control measures are effective and are being maintained in accordance with the submitted and approved operation and maintenance plan. 
D.  Compliance with Industrial or Construction Activity Storm Water Permit. 
1.  Any person subject to the state's current Industrial NPDES General Permit for storm water discharge shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the enforcement official upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause. 
2.  Any person subject to the state's current Construction NPDES General Permit for storm water discharge shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the enforcement official prior to or as a condition of a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, and development or improvement plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause. 
E.  Compliance with Best Management Practices. Every person or entity, including the above-listed categories, undertaking any activity or use of premises that may cause or contribute to storm water pollution or contamination or illicit or illegal discharges shall comply with best management practice (BMPs) consistent with the California Storm Water Quality Association (CASQA) Best Management Practice Handbooks or equivalent guidelines.

The building elevation fronting on that parking lot shall be counted as building frontage and the wall sign shall count towards the total square footage of signage permitted. 
(Ord. 2230 § 5, 2006).  
Chapter 17.38 - PARK AND RECREATION FACILITIES FEE 
 
17.38.010 - Established. 
For the purpose of providing additional revenues with which to finance the acquisition, improvement and expansion of public parks, playgrounds and recreational facilities, each applicant for a building permit for residential development shall pay, in addition to any other fees or charges provided elsewhere in this code, a park and recreation facilities fee. 
(Ord. 1237 § 4, 1979: prior code § 18.11).  
17.38.020 - Definitions. 
For purposes of construing the park and recreation facilities fee, the following definitions shall apply: 
A.  The term "dwelling unit" means and includes each single-family dwelling and each unit of an apartment, duplex or multiple dwelling structure designed as a separate habitation for one (1) or more persons. 
B.  The term "mobile home space" means and includes each space in a mobile home park designed to be used for parking a mobile home on a temporary, semipermanent or permanent basis.

Prior history: Prior code §§ 12.A.1.112.A.1.18,12.A.2.112.A.2.6,1 2.A.3.112.A.3.3,12.A.3.3-112.A.3.3-5. 12.A.3.4-112.A.3.4-2, 12.A.4.1-112.A.4.1-5, 12.A.4.2, 12.A.4.2-1, 12.A.4-2-2 and 1 2.A.4.2-3 and Ord. 12.50. 
Editor's note Section 1 of Ord. No. 2321, adopted Nov. 17, 2008, amended Ch. 17.48 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 17.48 was comprised of §§ 17.48.01017.48.220, and derived form Ord. 1679, adopted in 1987; Ord. 1794, adopted in 1991; and Ord. 2069, adopted in 2001. 
 
17.48.005 - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65202, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Merced does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.010 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Merced are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effort of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.020 - Purposes. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
A.  To protect human life and health; 
B.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
G.  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.030 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective biers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Controlling fill, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.040 - Definitions.

6.  "Appeal" means a request for a review of the city engineer's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
7.  "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one (1) to three (3) feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
8.  "Area of special flood hazard"  See "special flood hazard area." 
9.  "Backfill" means the placement of fill material within a specified depression, hole or excavation pit below the surrounding adjacent ground level as a means of improving floodwater conveyance or to restore the land to the natural contours existing prior to excavation.

18.  "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
19.  "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
20.  "Fill" is the placement of fill material at a specified location to bring the ground surface up to a desired elevation. 
21.  "Fill material" can be natural sand, dirt, soil or rock. For the purpose of floodplain management, fill material may include concrete, cement, soil cement, brick or similar material as approved on a case-by-case basis. 
22.  "Flood, flooding, or floodwater" means (a) a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) the overflow of inland or tidal waters, (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, and/or (3) mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current; and (b) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this definition. 
23.  "Flood elevation determination" means a determination by the administrator of the Federal Insurance Administration of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a one (1) percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year. 
24.  "Flood elevation study" means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevation, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
25.  "Flood hazard boundary map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
26.  "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
27.  "Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
28.  "Floodplain or floodprone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding"). 
29.  "Floodplain administrator" is the city engineer (see Section 17.48.120) designated to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
30.  "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
31.  "Floodplain management regulations" means Chapter 17.48 of the Municipal Code and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power, which control development in flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
32.  "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flooding hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed to conform with sound engineering standards. 
33.  "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. 
34.  "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water space elevation more than one (1) foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
35.  "Floodway encroachment lines" means the lines marking the limits of floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps. 
36.  "Floodway fringe" is the area of a floodplain on either side of the designated floodway where encroachment may be permitted. 
37.  "Fraud and victimization" (related to "variances") means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flooding damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
38.  "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
39.  "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
40.  "Governing body" is the Merced City Council, which is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
41.  "Hardship" (related to "variance") means the hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. Hardship requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as exceptional hardships. All of these problems can be resolved through other means, without granting a variance. This is so even if the alternative means are more expensive or complicated than building with a variance, or if they require the property owner to put the parcel to a different use than originally intended, or to build elsewhere. 
42.  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
43.  "Historic structure" means any structure that is: (a) listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; (b) certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district qualifying as a registered historic district; (c) individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or (d) individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: (1) by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or (2) directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs. 
44.  "Landfill" means a permitted location for the disposal, placement or dumping of garbage, trash, debris, junk or waste material. 
45.  "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
46.  "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
47.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter. 
48.  "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreation vehicle." 
49.  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
50.  "Map" means the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for a community issued by the Flood Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
51.  "Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
52.  "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
53.  "Minimum necessary" (related to "variances") means the minimum necessary to afford relief to the applicant of a variance with a minimum deviation form the requirements of this chapter. In the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, for example, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only that level that the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter. 
54.  "New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
55.  "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
56.  "Obstruction" includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
57.  "One hundred year flood" or "100-year flood" means a flood which has a one (1) percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the "base flood," which will be the term used throughout this chapter. 
58.  "Principal structure" means a structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use. 
59.  "Public safety and nuisances" (as related to "variances") means the granting of a variance must not result in additional threats to public safety or create nuisances. This chapter is intended to help protect the health, safety, well being and property of the local citizens. This is a long-range community effort made up of a combination of approaches such as adequate drainage systems, warning and evacuation plans, and keeping new property above the flood levels. These long-term goals can only be met if exceptions to the requirements of this chapter are kept to a bare minimum. 
60.  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: (a) built on a single chassis; (b) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (c) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (d) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
61.  "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
62.  "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the Municipal Code or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
63.  "Riverine" means relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
64.  "Sheet flow area"  See "area of shallow flooding." 
65.  "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area having special flood or flood related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, A0, A 1-A30, AE, A99, AH. 
66.  "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include any preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
67.  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
68.  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
69.  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."

17.48.190 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 17.48.060 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  All new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 17.48.140 through 17.48.190. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.200 - Nature of variances. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. Though these standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, in general, a properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
The City of Merced desires to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling, and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.210 - Appeals board. 
A.  The city council of the City of Merced shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
C.  In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
D.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the city engineer that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
E.  The city engineer will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.220 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 17.48.110 through 17.48.190 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary," considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon (1) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and (3) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create "nuisances," cause "fraud or victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A. through E. hereof are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors in subsection C. of Section 17.48.210 and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2321, § 1, 11-17-2008)  
17.48.230 - Severability.

Chapter 17.62 - PUBLIC FACILITIES IMPACT FEES 
 
17.62.010 - Purpose. 
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the City of Merced's ("city") General Plan and to mitigate the impacts caused by future development in Merced, certain public facilities must be or have been required to be constructed, and/or compensation measures must be or have been required to be taken to offset resources lost due to the future development. The city council has determined that public facilities impact fees are needed in order to finance these public facilities, and/or compensation measures, and to pay for each development's fair share of the construction costs of these improvements, and/or the costs of the compensation measures. In establishing the fees, the city council has found the fees to be consistent with its General Plan and pursuant to Government Code Section 65913.2 has considered the effects of the fee with respect to the city's housing needs as established in the Housing Element of the General Plan. 
(Ord. 2130 § 1 (part), 2003: Ord. 1989 § 1 (part), 1998).  
17.62.020 - Periodic review. 
The City of Merced shall review the public facilities impact fees on an annual basis to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of developments and whether the described public facilities are still needed. The city engineer shall be responsible for preparation of an annual report stating the amount of fees collected, the purposes for which the fees were collected, and the status of all projects proposed to be funded under this chapter. 
(Ord. 2130 § 1 (part), 2003: Ord. 1989 § 1 (part), 1998).  
17.62.030 - Impact fee calculation. 
The City of Merced has conducted a needs assessment for capital improvements within the city's specific urban development plan area for which fees are to be levied. The needs assessment, known as the public facilities financing plan (the "plan"), adopted in May 1998, revised in July 2003, and further revised in January 2006 and October 2012, has identified level of service standards, public facilities capital improvement needs, and has distinguished existing from future needs, and is approved. 
The data sources and methodology upon which fees are based are available for public inspection at the city clerk's office during regular business hours. The amount of the fees imposed have been based upon reasonable estimates of capital costs of public facilities expansions that will in probability be incurred by local government as the result of new development. 
The city council further finds: 
A.  The provision of new, expanded, or otherwise enhanced public facilities, for which a fee is charged, are reasonably related to the needs created by new development; 
B.  The fees imposed do not exceed the proportionate share of the costs incurred, or to be incurred, by the City of Merced in accommodating new development. The following factors have been considered in determining proportion share: 
1.  The need for public facilities capital improvements required to serve new development, based on a capital improvement program that shows deficiencies in capital facilities serving existing development, and the means, other than impact fees, by which any existing deficiencies will be eliminated within a reasonable period of time, and that shows additional demands anticipated to be placed on specified capital facilities by new development, 
2.  The cost of existing public facilities capital improvements. 
(Ord. 2232 § 1, 2006: Ord. 2130 § 1 (part), 2003: Ord. 1989 § 1 (part), 1998).

2.  The benefit and impact area on which the public facilities impact fee is imposed, the municipally owned public facilities to be financed, the estimated cost of these facilities, and the reasonable relationship between the fee and the various types of new developments are as set forth in the plan.

A.  Relationship to existing streets. The street system in the proposed subdivision shall relate functionally to the existing streets in the area adjoining the subdivision. 
B.  Centerlines. The centerlines of all streets wherever practicable shall be the continuations of the centerlines of existing streets, or shall be offset at least one hundred feet. 
C.  Intersections. Each street intersection or interception shall be as near to a right angle as is practicable. 
D.  Cul-de-sac or dead-end streets. No cul-de-sac or dead-end streets shall be longer than permitted by city standards. Where necessary to give access to or permit a satisfactory future subdivision of adjoining land, streets shall extend to the boundary of the property. 
E.  Street names. A subdivision plan shall conform to the following street designation pattern: 
1.  Streets which run in a general easterly and westerly direction may be designated as "street" or "drive." 
2.  Streets which run in a general northerly and southerly direction may be designated "avenue." 
3.  Cul-de-sacs shall be designated "court." 
4.  Loop streets shall have one name and may be designated "way" or "place." For purposes of this chapter, a loop street is defined as a street which forms a loop by having each end intersect on the same street and which does not intersect with any streets other than a cul-de-sac between its termini. 
5.  If cul-de-sac is a continuation of another street, it shall have the same name with the exception that it shall be designated "court." In the event the street in question has a cul-de-sac at each end, the one at the northerly or easterly terminus shall have the same name and the one at the other end shall have a different name.

Chapter 18.36 - DEVIATIONS 
Sections: 
 
18.36.010 - Conditions for granting deviance. 
The planning commission may vary the regulations relating to the subdivision of land by granting a deviation; provided it is shown by the subdivider that: 
A.  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property such as topography, fixed rights-of-way, unique location of easements, etc.; or 
B.  Because of the unique nature of a particular subdivision concept, design innovations are proposed which meet the functional standards of the zoning and subdivision regulations without strict adherence to the requirements of this title; or 
C.  In the case of a parcel map, the applicant is being denied the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity or zone in which the property is located; or 
D.  The granting of the deviation will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the vicinity or zone in which the property is located and will not nullify the intent and purpose of the general plan or these regulations. 
(Ord. 1342 § 2 (part), 1980: prior code § 25.100(a)).  
18.36.020 - Condition when deviance unnecessary. 
Where it is determined by the planning commission that the design of a proposed subdivision is in compliance with a development plan which has been adopted by the city council in conjunction with a planned development zone, the planning commission may approve such subdivision map without formally granting deviations for design factors which are not in strict compliance with the provisions of this title. 
(Ord. 1342 § 2 (part), 1980: prior code § 25.100(b)).

Chapter 18.40 - PARK DEDICATION 
Sections: 
 
18.40.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Government Code of the state. The park and recreation facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this chapter are in accordance with the recreation element of the general plan of the city and as such recreational element may hereafter be amended. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.020 - Requirements. 
At the time of approval of a tentative map or parcel map, the director of recreation and parks shall determine pursuant to this chapter the land required for dedication or in-lieu fee payment. As a condition of approval of a final subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the city, for neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this chapter. 
(Ord. 1643 § 1, 1987: Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.030 - General standard. 
It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety require that five acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within this city be devoted to neighborhood and community park and recreation purposes. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.040 - Formula for dedication of land. 
Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in the parks and open space master plan, an element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following formulas: 
The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated has been established pursuant to Section 66477(b) of the Government Code: 
Dwelling Type 	Zoning District 	Assumed Density 	Standard: Acres/DU's 
Single-family 	R-1 	3.15 persons/DU 	5 acres/317 DU's 
Duplex, low density apts. 	R-2 	2.51 persons/DU 	5 acres/398 DU's 
Mobile homes 	R & R-MH 	1.97 persons/DU 	5 acres/508 DU's 
Medium and high density apts. 	R-3 & R-4 	1.88 persons/DU 	5 acres/532 DU's 5 acres/1,000 
 
Dedication of the land shall be made in accordance with the procedures contained in Section 18.40.110. 
For the purposes of this section, the number of new dwelling units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the map when in an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel. When all or part of the subdivision is located in an area zoned for more than one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of new dwelling units in the area so zoned shall be the number proposed or the actual number for which building permits are issued, whichever is greater. In the case of a condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number of condominium units. The term "new dwelling unit" does not include dwelling units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is filed. 
The subdivider shall, without credit, (1) provide full street improvements and utility connections including, but not limited to, curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic-control devices, street trees, and sidewalks to dedicated land which is dedicated pursuant to this section, (2) provide for fencing along the property line of that portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land, (3) provide improved drainage through the site, and (4) provide other minimal improvements which the city council determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational purposes. 
The land to be dedicated and the improvements to be made pursuant to this section shall be approved by the director of recreation and parks. 
(Ord. 1643 § 2, 1987: Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.050 - Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication. 
A.  General Formula. If there is no park or recreation facility designated in the parks and open space master plan, to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land, plus twenty percent toward costs of off-site improvements, prescribed for dedication in Section 18.40.040, and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 18.40.070, such fee to be used for a local park which bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future residents of the area being subdivided. 
For the purposes of this chapter, "off-site improvements" are defined as those improvements which would have been required if land had been dedicated using the provisions of Section 18.40.040. 
B.  Fees in Lieu of LandFifty Parcels or Less. If the proposed subdivision contains fifty parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value, plus twenty percent toward costs of off-site improvements, of the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in Section 18.40.040, and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 18.40.070. 
However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in subdivisions of fifty parcels or less, where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the city council. 
C.  Use of Money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or rehabilitating existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1(part), 1984).  
18.40.060 - Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee. 
In subdivisions of over fifty parcels, the subdivider shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the following formula: 
A.  When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on the parks and open space master plan as the site for a local park, such portion shall be dedicated for local park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the provision of Section 18.40.070 shall be paid for the value of any additional land, plus twenty percent toward costs of off-site improvements, that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 18.40.040. 
B.  When a major part of the local park or recreation site has already been acquired by the city and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated and a fee computed pursuant to the provision of Section 18.40.070 shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land, plus twenty percent toward costs of off-street improvements, which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 18.40.040, such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreation facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreation facilities in the area serving the subdivision. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.070 - Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication. 
When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, value of the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Section 18.40.040, plus twenty percent toward costs of off-site improvements, such as extension of utility lines. The fee shall be determined by the following formula: 
1.2 DU's 	× 	Pop 
DU 	× 	 5 acres  
1,000 people 	× 	 FMV  
Buildable acre 	= 	in-lieu fee 
 
Where 
DU's 	= 	Number of dwelling units as defined in Section 18.40.040 
Pop 
DU 	= 	Population per dwelling unit 
FMV 	= 	Fair market value, as determined in Section 18.40-080 
Buildable 
acre 	= 	typical acre of the subdivision, with a slope less than 10 percent, and located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements or other restrictions 
 
Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be approved by the director of recreation and parks. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1(part), 1984).  
18.40.080 - Determination of fair market value. 
A.  An average annual fair market value shall be determined for each park service area by the city based upon a written report prepared by the director of recreation and parks in conjunction with an appraiser acceptable to the city. The report shall be based upon sales activity of all properties zoned for residential use within each park service area and will establish an average fair market value for that park service area. These average figures will be applied to all projects within each zone until the fee is next reviewed. 
B.  If the subdivider objects to the determined fair market value, he/she may appeal to the city council who shall hear the appeal under the same rules and obligations current for local board of equalization hearings, except that the burden of proof shall lie with the subdivider. 
(Ord. 1643 § 3, 1987: 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.090 - Determination of land or fee. 
Whether the city accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
A.  The natural features, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
B.  Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; 
C.  Feasibility of dedication; 
D.  Compatibility of dedication with the master park and recreation plan; and 
E.  The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways. 
The determination of the city council as to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
(Ord. 1643 § 4, 1987: Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.100 - Credit for private open space. 
No credit shall be given for private open space in the subdivision except as hereinafter provided. Where private open space usable for active recreational purposes is provided in a proposed planned development or real estate development as defined in Sections 11003 and 11003.1 of the Business and Professions Code, partial credit, not to exceed fifty percent, shall be eligible to receive credit against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the city council finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met: 
A.  That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and 
B.  The private park and recreation facilities shall be owned by a homes association composed of all property owners in the subdivision and being an incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only by a one hundred percent affirmative vote of the membership, operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a charge for proportionate share of expenses for maintaining the facilities. 
C.  That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreation purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor; and 
D.  That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location; and 
E.  That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreation element of the general plan; and 
F.  That the open space for which credit is given is generally a minimum of three acres and provides all of the local park basic elements listed below, or a combination of such and other recreation improvements that will meet the specific recreation park needs of the future residents of the area: 
1.  Recreational open spaces, which are generally defined as parks areas for active recreation pursuits such as soccer, golf, baseball, softball, and football and have at least one acre of maintained turf with less than five percent slope, 
2.  Court areas, which are generally defined as tennis courts, badminton courts, shuffleboard courts, or similar hard-surfaced areas especially designed and exclusively used for court games, 
3.  Recreational swimming areas, which are defined generally as fenced areas devoted primarily to swimming, diving, or both, including decks, lawned area, bathhouses, or other facilities developed and used exclusively for swimming and diving and consisting of no less than fifteen square feet of water surface for each three percent of the population of the subdivision, 
4.  Recreation buildings and facilities designed and primarily used for the recreational needs of the residents of the development. 
The determination of the city council as to whether credit shall be given and the amount of credit shall be final and conclusive. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.110 - Procedure. 
At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the director of recreation and parks shall determine pursuant to Section 18.40.040 the land required for dedication. If the city requires in-lieu fee payment by the subdivider, the city will set the amount of land upon which the in-lieu fee will be based at the time of final map approval. 
At the time of the filing of the final subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land as required by the director of recreation and parks. Where the director of recreation and parks has determined that fees shall be paid in lieu of or in addition to the dedication of land, the director of recreation and parks shall set the in-lieu fees based on the land dedication requirements as established at the time of tentative map approval using current land values at the time of final map approval with the formula set in Section 18.40.070 and using the process for determining fair market value as set forth in Section 18.40.080. The subdivider shall pay said fees in accordance with the following: 
A.  The entire fee shall be due and payable prior to approval of the final subdivision or parcel map; or 
B.  The subdivider may elect to defer payment of all or any part of such fee, and to pay the same on a lot-by-lot basis. 
In such event, the fee computed for each lot or parcel shall be payable at the time of issuance of the building permit for said lot or parcel, and shall be computed using the formula and fair market value in effect at the time. 
Open space covenants for private park or recreation facilities shall be submitted to the city prior to approval of the final subdivision map or parcel map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final subdivision map or parcel map. 
(Ord. 1643 § 5, 1987: Ord. 1625 § 1, 1986: Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.120 - Disposition of fees. 
Fees determined pursuant to Section 18.40.070 shall be paid to the city finance officer and shall be deposited into a special fund. Moneys in the fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for the acquisition or development of parkland, or improvements related thereto. 
Collected fees shall be appropriated by the city for a specific project to serve the residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five years upon receipt of payment or within five years after the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. 
If such fees are not so committed, these fees, less an administrative charge, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision. 
The city finance officer shall report to the city council at least annually on income, expenditures, and status of the special fund. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.130 - Exceptions. 
Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels, a fee shall be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit in accordance with Chapter 17.38. 
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivision; nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.140 - Subdivider-provided park and recreation improvements. 
The value of park and recreation improvements provided by the subdivider to the dedicated land shall be credited against the fees or dedication of land required by this chapter. The city council reserves the right to approve such improvements prior to agreeing to accept the dedication of land and to require in-lieu fee payments should the land and improvements be unacceptable. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.150 - Agency to accept land and fees. 
Land or fees required under this chapter shall be conveyed or paid directly to the city. The city shall develop a schedule pursuant to Section 66477 of the Government Code as amended by Chapter 1467 of the Statutes of 1982, specifying how, when, and where it will use the land or fees, or both, to develop park or recreational facilities to serve the residents of the subdivision. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.160 - Access. 
All land offered for dedication to local park or recreational purposes shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street. This requirement may be waived by the city council if the city council determines that public street access is unnecessary for the maintenance of the park area or use thereof by the residents. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).  
18.40.170 - Sale of dedicated land. 
If circumstances arise which indicate that another site would be more suitable for local park or recreational purposes serving the subdivision and the neighborhood (such as receipt of a gift of additional parkland or change in school location), any dedicated land may be sold upon the approval of the city council with the resultant funds being used for the purchase of a more suitable site. 
(Ord. 1526 § 1 (part), 1984).

In addition to posting, notice of the hearing shall be published once not later than five (5) calendar days prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published within Merced County. Those receiving notice and any other interested person shall be provided an opportunity to be heard at the hearing. 
5.  The hearing to consider whether to order the cost of the abatement specially assessed against the subject real property shall be held before the city council. At the conclusion of the hearing, the city council shall determine the cost of abatement and whether to order that cost specially assessed against the subject real property. If the cost of abatement is ordered to be specially assessed against the subject real property, then the assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary city taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as are provided for ordinary city taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of city taxes are applicable to the special assessment. 
6.  If the city council orders the cost of the abatement to be specially assessed against the subject real property, the council also may cause a notice of abatement lien to be recorded. The notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of property, set forth the last known address of the record owner or possessor, set forth the date upon which abatement of the nuisance was ordered by the city council and the date the abatement was complete, and include a legal description of the real property subject to the lien and the amount of the abatement cost. 
7.  Nothing in this section prohibits the summary abatement of a nuisance upon order of the city council or upon order of any other city officer authorized by law to summarily abate nuisances if the city council or officer determines that the nuisance constitutes an immediate threat to public health or safety. 
(Ord. 1805 § 1 (part), 1992).  
19.28.100 - Appeals. 
A.  Upon payment of the appeal fee established by resolution of the city council and the filing of an appeal, an applicant may appeal the imposition of the fees established pursuant to Section 19.28.070, a determination by the environmental coordinator denying issuance of a program completion certificate pursuant to Section 19.28.060, a stop work order issued by the environmental coordinator pursuant to this chapter, or a revocation by the planning commission pursuant to this chapter. 
B.  The appeal fee and appeal shall be filed with the clerk of the city within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the notice of the imposed fees, the determination of the environmental coordinator denying issuance of a program completion certificate, the date of issuance of a stop work order, or the date of a revocation undertaken pursuant to this order. The appeal shall be in writing to the Merced city council and shall include a statement of the reasons for the appeal. 
C.  Upon receipt of the appeal fee and the appeal, a hearing shall be scheduled before the city council. The city council shall be authorized to deny the introduction of evidence not previously considered by the environmental coordinator and decide the matter after oral argument presented during the hearing, or to admit evidence not previously considered by the environmental coordinator, or conduct a de novo hearing. The decision by the city council granting or denying the appeal shall be final and shall be accompanied by findings of fact. 
1.  In deciding an appeal of a fee imposed pursuant to Section 19.28.070 the city council shall be authorized to establish a different fee as the amount of actual direct and indirect costs incurred by the city for a particular program. 
2.  In deciding an appeal from the determination of the environmental coordinator denying issuance of a program completion certificate the city council shall issue a program completion certificate if it determines that compliance with all of the terms of the adopted program has been achieved, or shall deny issuance of a program completion certificate if it determines that compliance with all of the terms of the adopted program has not been achieved. 
3.  In deciding an appeal from the issuance of a stop work order, the city council shall affirm the stop work order if it finds that there has been non-compliance with the adopted program. If the city council finds that there has been compliance with the terms of the adopted program then the city council shall discharge the stop work order. 
4.  In deciding an appeal from a revocation undertaken pursuant to this chapter, the city council shall deny the appeal if it finds any of the grounds set forth in Section 19.28.090(C)(3) of this chapter exist. If the city council finds that none of the grounds set forth in Section 19.28.090(C)(3) exist, then it shall reinstate the special permit as if the revocation had not occurred.

Chapter 20.04 - INTERPRETATION 
 
20.04.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter establishes rules and procedures for interpreting the zoning ordinance to ensure that it is applied and enforced in a consistent manner.

20.04.020 - Authority. 
The director of development services, planning manager, planning division staff, city attorney, and his/her designees are delegated the authority by the city council to interpret the meaning and applicability of all provisions in the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.04.030 - Rules of interpretation. 
A.  General Rules. The following general rules apply to the interpretation and application of the zoning ordinance. 
1.  The specific controls over the general. 
2.  Where there is a conflict between text and any figure, illustration, graphic, heading, map, table, or caption, the text governs. 
3.  The words "shall," "will," "is to," and "are to" are mandatory. "Should" means a regulation that is not mandatory, but must be either fulfilled or the applicant must demonstrate an alternative that fulfills the intent of the regulation. "May" is permissive. 
4.  The following conjunctions are interpreted as follows: 
a.  "And" means that all items or provisions so connected apply. 
b.  "Or" means that all items or provisions so connected apply singularly or in any combination. 
c.  "Either . . . or" means that one (1) of the items or provisions so connected apply singularly, but not in combination. 
5.  All officials, bodies, agencies, ordinances, policies, and regulations referred to in the zoning ordinance are those of Merced unless otherwise noted. 
B.  Calendar Days. Numbers of days specified in the zoning ordinance are construed as continuous calendar days unless otherwise noted. Where the last of a number of days falls on a holiday or weekend, time limits specified in the zoning ordinance are extended to the following working day. 
C.  Land Use Regulation Tables. Land use regulation tables in Part 2 (Zoning Districts) establish permitted land uses within each zoning district. Notations within these tables shall have the following meanings: 
1.  Permitted Uses. A "P" means that a use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district and is not subject to discretionary review and approval. 
2.  Conditionally Permitted Uses. A "C" means that a use requires approval of a conditional use permit. An "M" means that a use requires approval of a minor use permit. 
3.  Site Plan Review Required. A "SP" means that a use requires approval of a site plan review permit. 
4.  Uses Not Allowed. An "X" in a cell means that a use is not allowed in the respective zoning district. 
D.  Unlisted Land Uses. If a proposed land use is not specifically listed in the zoning ordinance, the use is not permitted except as follows: 
1.  The director of development services may determine that an unlisted proposed use is equivalent to a permitted use (or requires a site plan permit, conditional use permit, minor use permit, or other such permit) if all of the following findings can be made: 
a.  The use is no greater in density or intensity than other uses in the applicable zoning district. 
b.  The use is compatible with permitted or conditionally permitted uses in the applicable zoning district. 
c.  The use will meet the purpose of the applicable zoning district. 
d.  The use is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan. 
e.  The use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare. 
f.  The use is similar to one (1) or more other uses allowed in that zone. 
2.  A proposed use unlisted in the land use regulation table for a zoning district shall not be permitted if that land use is listed as a permitted use in one (1) or more other zoning districts. In such a case, the absence of the use in the land use regulation table shall be interpreted as a prohibition of the use in the respective zoning district, unless the director of development services deems otherwise under the provisions of Section 20.04.030(D)(1) above. 
3.  When the director of development services determines that a proposed use is equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use shall be treated in the same manner as the listed use with respect to development standards, permits required, and all applicable requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
E.  Uses Prohibited by State or Federal Law. No use that is prohibited, unlawful, violates or is inconsistent with federal or state law, or any provision in this zoning ordinance, shall be allowed or permitted in any zoning district within the City of Merced. 
F.  Zoning Map Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
2.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
3.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following city limits. 
4.  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks. 
5.  In unsubdivided property or where a zoning district boundary divides a parcel, the location of the boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions shown upon the map, shall be determined by the use of the scale on the map. 
6.  In case further uncertainty exists, the director of development services shall determine the exact location of the boundaries. The director's decision may be appealed to the planning commission that upon written application by a property owner or upon its own motion, shall determine the exact location of the boundaries. 
G.  Parcels Containing Two (2) or More Zoning Districts. 
1.  For parcels containing two (2) or more zoning districts ("split zoning"), the location of the zoning district boundary shall be determined by the director of development services. 
2.  For parcels containing two (2) or more zoning districts, the applicable regulations for each zoning district shall apply within the zoning district boundaries as identified on the zoning map. 
3.  When a zoning district boundary interferes with existing structures or setbacks, the director may approve a minor adjustment of the boundary. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.04.040 - Procedures for interpretation/determinations. 
A.  Request for Interpretation. The director of development services or his/her designee shall respond in writing to written requests for interpretation of the zoning ordinance if, in the opinion of the director, the requested interpretation would substantially clarify an ambiguity which interferes with the effective administration of the zoning ordinance. When the director makes such a determination, the following procedures shall apply: 
1.  The request shall be in writing and shall state which provision is to be interpreted and shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in the latest planning and development fee schedule. 
2.  The request shall provide any information that the director requires to assist in its review. 
3.  The director shall respond to an interpretation request within thirty (30) days of receiving the request.

C.  Low Medium Density Residential (R-2). The R-2 zoning district is intended to stabilize, protect, and encourage the establishment and maintenance of a suitable environment for single-family dwellings, duplex homes, limited multi-family dwellings, and other land uses typically compatible with a low to medium-density residential setting. 
D.  Medium Density Residential (R-3). The R-3 zoning district provides an area for a full range of residential uses, including single-family dwellings, duplex homes, multi-family dwellings, single room occupancy housing, and other land uses typically compatible with a medium density residential setting. The R-3 zoning district is divided into two (2) subzones (R-3-1.5 and R-3-2) allowing for a range of permitted residential densities. 
E.  High Density Residential (R-4). The R-4 zoning district provides an area for the highest density residential uses in Merced. Permitted uses include single-family dwellings, duplex homes, multi-family dwellings, single room occupancy housing, and other land uses typically compatible with a high-density residential setting in close proximity to shopping, transportation, and other facilities.

1.  A minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the front elevations along a street shall have a minimum 25-foot garage setback. 
2.  A minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the garages along a street with the standard 20-foot setback shall have recessed doors (recessed at least one (1) foot). 
3.  No three-car garages shall be allowed on five thousand (5,000) square-foot lots, except on lots with alley access or lots exceeding sixty (60) feet in width. 
4.  All subdivisions shall provide a variety of dwelling elevations appropriate for the scale of the project. Elevations shall be approved by the planning division. At a minimum, the same elevations shall not be repeated for adjacent houses. Varied front setbacks and heights are encouraged as ways of achieving variety. 
5.  Windows, doors, and garage doors (except recessed garage doors) on the front elevation shall have raised trim in order to provide visual interest and relief. 
6.  Plans for two-story structures immediately adjacent to a developed R-1 area shall receive special attention by the planning division. Planning Division staff shall consider the relationship of second-story windows, doors, and balconies with the privacy of neighbors, and may require that these features be redesigned or omitted from second-story rear walls. 
E.  Exceptions on Required Front Setback. In any residential zoning district, the required front setback may be modified with a minor use permit if at least fifty (50) percent of the homes are already constructed on the same block with front setbacks that are different from the front setback requirement in Table 20.08-2 (Setback and Height Standards for Residential Zoning Districts).

20.08.050 - Rural residential zoning district. 
A.  Purpose. This section establishes supplemental standards and procedures for properties within the rural residential zoning district. The intent of this section is to maintain the existing rural character of these properties and to allow for continued agricultural uses and operations in addition to residential uses. 
B.  Agricultural Uses 
1.  Crop, orchard, and vineyard operations are permitted as a primary land use in the rural residential zoning district if a dwelling unit is also located on the property. 
2.  The keeping of livestock and poultry shall be a permitted use in the rural residential zoning district subject to the requirements of Merced Municipal Code Section 6.04.081 (Exception to Livestock and Poultry Regulations). 
C.  Infrastructure Improvements. Through a special project permit process as outlined in Section 20.68.060, the city council may waive or defer for a specified amount of time requirements for properties in the rural residential zoning district only to install city sewer, city water, curb, sidewalk, streetlights, and other infrastructure improvements consistent with adopted city policies and regulation.  
Chapter 20.10 - COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
20.10.010 - Purpose of the commercial zoning districts. 
A.  Neighborhood Commercial (C-N). The C-N zoning district provides areas for shopping centers and other commercial uses that serve the day-to-day needs of residential neighborhoods. The C-N districts shall have a minimum area of three (3) acres and shall be located only where analysis of the residential population demonstrates that the facilities are justified. 
B.  Shopping Center Commercial (C-SC). The C-SC zoning district provides areas for grocery stores, supermarkets, and other retail establishments selling groceries to serve local residents as well as the larger regional market. The C-SC districts shall have a minimum area of five (5) acres. 
C.  Regional/Central Commercial (C-C). The C-C zoning district provides areas for a diversity of commercial and residential land uses in the central business district and regional centers. These uses help to support a vibrant retail destination, provide jobs for residents, and accommodate commercial and service uses to meet the needs of community and regional businesses and residents. 
D.  Office Commercial (C-O). The C-O zoning district provides a location for a broad range of office uses including professional offices, business offices, medical offices, and regional or "back" offices. The C-O zoning district can also accommodate limited "accessory" restaurant, retail, and service uses that cater to the needs of on-site employees and visitors. 
E.  Thoroughfare Commercial (C-T). The C-T zoning district provides areas for auto-oriented commercial uses that accommodate the needs of people traveling on highways and local motorists. The C-T zoning district also accommodates large recreational facilities and heavy commercial uses that benefit from proximity to the highway. 
F.  General Commercial (C-G). The C-G zoning district provides areas for heavy commercial and light industrial uses that may impact neighboring uses and often require large parcels and benefit from separation from retail uses. The C-G districts are to be established in areas of four (4) acres or larger. 
G.  Business Park (B-P). The B-P zoning district provides a location for employment-intensive uses within an attractive campus-like setting. The B-P zoning district shall primarily allow "back" offices, research and development businesses but also limited commercial retail uses to serve employees in the area. The B-P zoning district shall have a minimum area of five (5) acres.

20.10.030 - Development standards and guidelines for commercial zoning districts. 
A.  General Standards. Table 20.10-2 identifies development standards that apply to all parcels and structures located in commercial zoning districts. See Figure 20.10-1. 
B.  Outdoor Operation of Uses. 
1.  The outdoor operation of a land use in the C-C and C-N zoning districts shall require approval of a site plan review permit. Outdoor dining in accordance with Chapter 12.36 (Restaurant Encroachment Permits), outdoor recreation, commercial parking lots, and other similar permitted uses that necessitate outdoor operation are exempt from this requirement. 
2.  The storage of vehicles, equipment, and materials in the C-T and C-G zoning district shall be either located entirely within a completely enclosed building; or entirely enclosed by a screen fence or hedge not less than six (6) feet high. This requirement shall not apply to retail nurseries or vehicle sales and rental uses. 
3.  All land uses shall be located entirely within a completely enclosed building in the B-P zoning district. 
C.  Location of Parking and Loading Facilities. Parking and loading facilities in a commercial zoning district shall be set back a minimum of eight (8) feet from an exterior property line when located across the street from a residential zoning district. 
D.  Temporary Warehousing and Storage Uses in the Downtown C-C Zoning District. The following uses require a site plan review permit pursuant to Chapter 20.68.050 of this code in the downtown C-C zoning district: 
1.  Temporary warehouse and storage uses, but only within existing buildings or structures on properties with environmental issues, restrictions, or limitations identified by local, state, or federal agencies, subject to conditions in Section 20.10.030(D)(2) of this chapter. While warehouse and storage uses are generally prohibited and discouraged in the C-C district, it is recognized by the city that environmental issues, restrictions, or limitations identified by local, state, or federal agencies may limit or prohibit the uses, otherwise permitted or conditionally permitted in this district. The city further recognizes the substantial public and private investment made to both public and private properties in the downtown C-C district and the need for property owners to have a source of funds to meet property expenses as well as to ensure that the public and private investments are protected by preventing these properties from falling into disrepair and becoming blighted. Temporary warehouse and storage use does not include traditional mini-storage where multiple tenants or customers rent or lease storage space from the property owner or mini-storage operator. 
2.  The following conditions shall be applied to the site plan review permit for temporary warehouse and storage uses in the downtown C-C district: 
a.  When a site plan review permit is granted for any property within the downtown C-C district with environmental issues, restrictions, or limitations identified by local, state, or federal agencies, the use of the property shall have no more than the minimum number of employees for the minimal amount of time required for business operation in order to minimize human exposure. 
b.  The site plan review permit shall be valid and last only until remediation of the environmental issue, restriction, or limitation is complete and the environmental issue, restriction, or limitation is officially "closed" by the local, state, or federal agency. The site plan review permit shall be reviewed at least every three (3) years to determine if the need still exists for the restriction. If the need no longer exists, the property shall be brought into compliance with downtown C-C district within ninety (90) days after notice to the property owner. 
c.  The site plan review permit shall require that commercial activities occur that are observable through any window facing Main Street at the street and sidewalk level. It is the intent of this condition not to allow window displays of stacked boxes or merchandise. Examples of commercial activities encouraged hereunder shall include, but are not limited to, window display of art, goods, merchandise for sale at a different location by the warehouse or storage user, and public service notices and announcements, with such display shielding warehoused merchandise from any window facing Main Street. 
d.  The site plan review permit shall require that proper maintenance and upkeep of the appearance of the building and the property occur during the duration of the site plan review permit including, but not limited to, weed abatement, graffiti abatement, and such other conditions as the site plan review committee determines is appropriate.

E.  Development Guidelines for the C-C (Regional Centers Only) and B-P Zoning Districts. The city shall consider the following guidelines when reviewing development project applications in the C-C (for regional centers only, outside of the downtown C-C district) and B-P Zoning Districts: 
1.  Site Design. 
a.  All buildings should relate visually to one another and appear to be part of a unified design theme. 
b.  Larger buildings should be broken down into a group of buildings clustered into traditional building compounds or campus configurations. 
c.  When multiple structures are proposed as part of a single project, the structures shall be designed to appear as part of an integrated complex within a unified site design and architectural characteristics. 
d.  Building entries should be located so that they are easily identifiable. Each project should provide a well-defined entry sequence for pedestrian and vehicular uses from the street to the building. 
2.  Building Design. 
a.  Buildings shall feature quality design and architectural interest that enhances the aesthetics of the site and general vicinity. 
b.  New development should include a variety of building types and designs in addition to the concrete tilt-up type construction which is often used. 
c.  Buildings should appear to be of a pedestrian scale. Pedestrian scale building design can be achieved through outdoor patios; awnings, overhangs, and trellises; changes in building massing; changes in building materials and colors; defined building facades with an identifiable base, middle, and top; and other similar features. 
3.  Landscaping. 
a.  Development projects shall provide adequate, sustainable, drought-tolerant landscaping to enhance the appearance of buildings and provide an attractive environment for employees and the general public. 
b.  Landscaping should provide an aesthetically pleasing transition between the building and adjacent sidewalks or pedestrian paths. Landscaping should soften the visual impact of buildings when viewed from the street, parking areas, or adjacent properties. 
c.  Landscaping shall be provided along street frontage to provide visual interest, support a unifying character to the street, incorporate on-site storm drainage facilities, and enhance the appearance of individual developments. Landscape elements should be coordinated with adjacent properties to provide a compatible visual character. 
4.  Parking. 
a.  In order to reduce public views of parking areas, a significant amount of a development's parking area should be located beside or behind the building that it serves. 
b.  Surface parking areas should be divided into smaller units to decrease visual impacts associated with large expanses of pavement and vehicles. 
c.  Parking areas shall include designated pedestrian access to building entrances. 
d.  Visual screening shall be provided for parking areas that can be viewed from adjacent development sites or from public streets. Screening may be in the form of trees and shrubs and/or landscaped berms. 
5.  Pedestrian Circulation. 
a.  Sidewalks and pathways shall be provided to accommodate pedestrian circulation from parking areas to buildings, between buildings, and to plazas, open spaces, and other outdoor amenities. This pedestrian network should enhance a campus-like appearance of the development site and functional awnings should be added to protect pedestrians from the rain when walking along building frontages of businesses which about each other. 
b.  Pedestrian systems should be physically separated from vehicular circulation as much as possible. Areas where the two (2) systems cross or are physically adjacent should be minimized to reduce traffic hazards and make the pedestrian system more efficient, pleasant, and visually attractive. 
c.  Intersections where pedestrian routes cross vehicular circulation shall be clearly marked for visual identification by both motorists and pedestrians. 
6.  Service Areas. 
a.  Loading and service dock areas should be located to the rear or sides of buildings and away from main building entrances and other high visibility areas. 
b.  Loading and service docks, truck areas, and outdoor storage areas, shall be screened from public view. 
c.  Service areas should be visually unobtrusive and integrated with each building's architecture and site design. 
7.  Utilities and Backflow Preventers. 
a.  Utility cabinets and meters shall be contained within the building or otherwise fully screened. 
b.  Backflow prevention devices shall be fully screened from public view through the use of landscaping, berms, low walls, or other screening techniques. 
8.  Waste Storage. 
a.  Trash bins shall be located within a trash enclosure at all times and screened from public view. Gates shall remain closed and secured except during pick-up. 
b.  Trash enclosures should be located away from main entry driveways if feasible. 
c.  Trash enclosures shall be constructed of durable materials with color, texture, and architectural detailing that is consistent with the overall site and building design. 
d.  No materials, supplies, equipment, service vehicles, finished or semi-finished products, raw materials, or articles of similar nature shall be stored or permitted to remain outside of buildings or be visible from adjacent properties or adjoining streets. 
9.  Signs and Lighting. 
a.  All signs and exterior lighting shall be designed to support a unified design theme within a development area. 
b.  Multiple-tenant buildings and complexes shall develop a master sign program that supports a unified design theme within a development area. The master sign program, to be approved by the planning commission, site plan review committee, or through an administrative conditional use permit for signs, shall establish requirements for consistent use of sign materials, location, size, height, color, and lighting.

Chapter 20.14 - DOWNTOWN ZONING DISTRICTS 
Sections : 
 
20.14.010 - Purpose of the downtown zoning districts. 
A.  Downtown Core (D-COR). The purpose of the D-COR zoning district is to maintain and enhance a vibrant downtown core with a diversity of land uses. The D-COR zoning district supports downtown as a destination for arts, entertainment, retail, and dining uses, with housing that contributes to the vitality of the area. The design of development helps to create a pedestrian-friendly environment and an active public realm. A mixture of land uses and higher intensity development supports transportation options, including walking, bicycling, and use of transit. 
B.  Downtown Office (D-O). The purpose of the D-O zoning district is to accommodate a concentration of office uses that support a vibrant and dynamic downtown. The D-O zoning district accommodates a variety of land uses, including personal services in addition to office uses. In the D-O zoning district buildings are designed to support an active and inviting public realm. The D-O zoning district creates an attractive environment for businesses and employers that enhances the economic vitality of the community. The D-O zoning district also serves as a buffer between more intensive development in the D-COR zoning district and surrounding residential neighborhoods. 
C.  Downtown Commercial (D-CM). The purpose of the D-CM zoning district is to encourage growth and investment in commercial areas adjacent to Merced's downtown core. New development in the D-CM zoning district will provide amenities for adjacent residential neighborhoods and enhance the appearance of gateways into downtown. Development supports a pedestrian-friendly environment with buildings located near the front sidewalk and parking located to the side or rear. A variety of land uses, including residential, commercial, and office, contribute to an active and inviting environment.

a.  Surface parking shall be located only to the rear or side of buildings, unless approved with a minor use permit. See Figure 20.14-2. Surface parking is only allowed towards the back of the building with access on alleys and screening, which would block visibility of a surface parking lot from the exterior streets, unless otherwise approved with a minor use permit. 
b.  Parking completely or partially underground may match the setbacks of the main building, but shall be screened from view. 
2.  New Driveways. For parcels served by a rear alley, new driveways for vehicular access shall be off the alley only. New driveways off the front or side of the parcel may be approved with a minor use permit. To approve the minor use permit, the director of development services must make the following findings: 
a.  The driveway is necessary to provide vehicle access to the property. 
b.  The design and placement of the new driveway minimizes impacts on pedestrians to the greatest extent possible. 
Figure 20.14-2 Downtown Parking Location and Buffers
 
3.  Buffers and Screening. 
a.  Surface parking located adjacent to an exterior property line shall be screened along the public right-of-way with a decorative wall, hedge, trellis, or landscaping at least three (3) feet in height. See Figure 20.14-2. 
b.  A landscaped buffer at least three (3) feet wide and six (6) feet tall shall be located for any surface parking adjacent to a single-family home. See Figure 20.14-2. 
4.  Parking Structure Design. 
a.  All exterior walls of parking structures shall feature materials that maintain a common architectural character with the structure served by the parking structure. 
b.  Parking structure facades shall be broken-up through the use of textured concrete on exterior walls, the incorporation of planters and trellises at each parking level, and other architectural treatments to minimize large blank walls without architectural relief. 
c.  Parked vehicles at each level within the structure shall be shielded from view from adjoining streets through the use of architectural appurtenances and landscaping. 
D.  Street-Level Building Design (Only applies in the D-COR zone). Exceptions to the following standards (D1, D2, D3, & D4) may be granted by the director of development services through the issuance of a minor use permit. 
1.  Building Orientation. Buildings shall be oriented towards a public street with the primary entrance to the site or building directly accessible from an adjacent sidewalk. The director of development services may allow buildings and their primary entrances to be oriented toward a public space. The primary entrance to a building shall not be oriented towards surface parking. See Figure 20.14-3. 
Figure 20.14-3 Building Orientation
 
2.  Blank Walls. The maximum length of an unarticulated/blank building wall shall be ten (10) feet in the D-COR zoning district, and twenty-five (25) feet for all other downtown zoning districts, unless otherwise approved with a minor use permit. Architectural articulation shall have similar pattern as other adjacent buildings to provide cohesive design in the neighborhood. See ? in Figure 20.14-4. Building articulation may be provided by: 
a.  Doors, windows, and other building openings; 
b.  Building projections or recesses, doorway and window trim, artwork displays, and other details that provide architectural articulation and design interest; 
c.  Varying wall planes, heights or contrasting materials and colors; and, 
d.  Awnings, canopies, or arcades to reinforce the pedestrian scale and provide shade and cover from the elements. 
Figure 20.14-4 Downtown Blank Wall and Storefront Width
 
3.  Storefront Width. The maximum building/storefront width in the D-COR zoning district shall be fifty (50) feet and one hundred (100) feet in all other downtown zoning districts, unless otherwise approved through a minor use permit. Larger buildings shall be broken down into a pedestrian-scale rhythm with individual building bay width of twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) feet. See ? in Figure 20.14-4. 
4.  Ground Floor Building Transparency. 
a.  The ground floor street-facing building walls of nonresidential uses shall provide transparent windows or doors with views into the building for a minimum of forty (40) percent of the building frontage located between two and one-half (2½) and seven (7) feet above the sidewalk. Fifty (50) percent of the transparent windows or doors area shall remain clear to allow views into the building. See Figure 20.14-5. 
Figure 20.14-5 Downtown Ground Floor Building Transparency
 
b.  Exceptions to this transparency requirement may be allowed with a minor use permit if the director of development services finds that: 
(1)  The proposed use has unique operational characteristics which preclude building openings, such as for a cinema or theater; and, 
(2)  Street-facing building walls will exhibit architectural relief and detail, and will be enhanced with landscaping or artwork in such a way as to create visual interest at the pedestrian level. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
Chapter 20.16 - URBAN VILLAGE ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
20.16.010 - Purpose of the urban village zoning districts. 
A.  General. The urban village zoning districts are intended to promote the development of high quality neighborhoods in new growth areas of Merced. These neighborhoods are characterized by a mixture of land uses that enable residents to easily walk and bike to a variety of destinations. A diversity of housing types, including single-family homes and multi-family housing, expand affordable housing options for all income levels. A network of interconnected streets allows for safe and convenient circulation that minimizes traffic congestion on major roadways. The location, type, and intensity of new development support increased transit use and expands transportation options for residents and workers. Development in the urban villages zoning districts supports a high quality design environment with a distinctive sense of place enjoyed by residents, workers, and visitors. 
The urban village zoning districts implement the urban village concept in the general plan. This concept envisions urban villages consisting of three (3) components: A commercial or mixed-use commercial core, an inner village residential area, and an outer village residential area. The basic form of the urban village concept is illustrated in Figure 20.16-1. 
B.  Inner Village Residential (R-IV). The R-IV zoning district allows for higher density residential development within an urban village. The R-IV zoning district accommodates a range of housing types, including apartments, townhomes, and other forms of multi-family housing. The R-IV zoning district supports higher density housing located in close proximity to transit, employment uses, and commercial areas. The R-IV zoning district also may function as a buffer between village commercial areas and surrounding lower-density residential neighborhoods. 
C.  Outer Village Residential (R-OV). The R-OV zoning district allows for lower density residential uses within an urban village. Typical housing types within the R-OV zoning district include single-family homes, duplex homes, and second units. The R-OV zoning district accommodates single-family neighborhoods located in close proximity to public amenities such as parks and schools as well as neighborhood-serving retail and service uses. 
D.  Village Commercial (C-V). The C-V zoning district functions as the center of activity within an urban village. The C-V zoning district accommodates a diversity of land uses, including commercial, residential, and civic uses. Development in the C-V zoning district supports a pedestrian-friendly environment and encourages the use of transit. Local streets, sidewalks, and bicycle paths provide safe and convenient access to the C-V zoning district from surrounding residential neighborhoods. The C-V zoning district meets the day-to-day shopping needs of area residents and provides a central gathering place for the use and enjoyment of surrounding neighborhoods.

Chapter 20.20 - SPECIAL USE ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
20.20.010 - Urban transition (U-T) zoning district. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the U-T zoning district is to allow the lawful continuation of land uses on land that is annexed to the city but not proposed for immediate urban development. 
B.  Land Use Regulations. The following land uses shall be permitted in the U-T zoning district: 
1.  Any legally established and operated use in full compliance with the Merced County Code existing at time of the annexation of the property to the city. 
2.  New agriculture uses, but not including hog raising, if such uses are in compliance with all other laws and ordinances, provided there is no retail sale of products on the premises. 
3.  Large and small residential day care facilities. 
4.  Home occupations. 
C.  Development Standards. Structures within the U-T zoning district shall comply with the applicable county development standards in effect at the time of annexation, except as provided below. 
1.  Height. Buildings shall not exceed a height of forty (40) feet for principal buildings and twenty-five (25) feet for accessory buildings, except that these heights may be exceeded by any legal buildings as they existed at the time of annexation. 
2.  Yards. The required yards that existed for the subject lot at the time of annexation to the city shall be the minimum required yard areas, except for new or enlarged accessory buildings of a legally permitted primary use and dwelling units, which may have a minimum exterior yard area of twenty (20) feet and a minimum interior yard area of ten (10) feet. 
3.  Residential Density. Except for secondary units permitted under Chapter 20. 42 (Second Units), residential density of the lot may not be increased. 
D.  Existing Land Uses. 
1.  Land in the U-T zoning district may continue with any legal and lawful use that existed in the county without time limit. However, this authority to continue such uses is not intended to legalize uses or structures operating or existing contrary to the terms of any other law or ordinance. 
2.  Any major expansion in use, density, or other measurement of size or intensity shall require a change to a zoning district other than the U-T zoning district. The director of development services shall determine whether a proposed change to an existing use will require a change to a zoning district other than the U-T zoning district. 
E.  Annexation Requirements. At the time of annexation, the property owner shall submit a written statement and site plan on a form provided by the city that describes the use, height, area, lot, yard, and parking characteristics of the subject property. Those characteristics that were legally established and existing in the county at the time of annexation will be permitted to continue in the city within the U-T district upon annexation. A record of these property characteristics will be established and will become part of the U-T zoning district for the subject property. If the property owner does not submit the written statement and site plan as required by this section, then the city may prepare its own written statement in order to complete the zoning process upon annexation. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.20.020 - Planned Development (P-D) zoning districts. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the planned development (P-D) zoning districts is to allow for high quality development that deviates from standards and regulations applicable to other zoning districts within Merced. The planned development zoning districts are intended to promote creativity in building design, flexibility in permitted land uses, and innovation in development concepts. The planned development zoning districts are also intended to ensure project consistency with the general plan. Planned development zoning districts provide land owners with enhanced flexibility to take advantage of unique site characteristics to develop projects that will provide public benefits for residents, employees, and visitors to Merced. 
B.  Types of PD Zoning Districts. There are two (2) types of planned development zoning districts: The planned development (P-D) zoning district and the residential planned development (RP-D) zoning district. The RP-D zoning district is identical to the P-D zoning district except that only residential land uses are permitted in the RP-D zoning district and a larger project size is required for the P-D zoning district. 
C.  Permitted Land Uses. In all planned development zoning districts, permitted land uses shall conform to the applicable general plan designation, provided that such land uses are shown on the official site utilization plan for the particular P-D zone as approved by the city council, and except that in the RP-D zoning district, only residential land uses shall be permitted. 
D.  Minimum Project Size. Minimum project size in the planned development zoning districts shall be as follows: 
1.  Planned Development (P-D) zoning district: five (5) acres minimum. 
2.  Residential Planned Development (RP-D) zoning district: one (1) acre minimum. 
3.  Planned Development projects located within the area shown in Figure 20.20-1 and at least one-half (½) of an entire city block shall be exempt from these minimum project size requirements.

Chapter 20.32 - INTERFACE REGULATIONS 
 
20.32.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter establishes special permit requirements for projects proposed near to existing land uses that might be negatively impacted by the new use. These requirements are intended to protect existing residential neighborhoods and to ensure that new development is designed in a manner to minimize negative impacts on nearby uses to the greatest extent possible to promote harmonious and orderly development, and the stability of land values and investments. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.32.020 - Definitions. 
The following terms when used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
A.  A parcel is "abutting" another parcel if it is located immediately adjacent to another parcel and shares at least one (1) property lot line. 
B.  A parcel is "across from" another parcel if any of its property lines when extended across the street or alley touch the parcel on the other side of the street. 
C.  A parcel is "developed" if there is a minimum of twenty (20) percent lot coverage and the parcel contains a land use legally conforming to the zoning district within which it is located. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.32.030 - Site plan review. 
A.  A proposed use in a "High Impact" zoning district shall require a site plan review permit if it is abutting or across from a developed parcel in a "Low Impact" zoning district. For example, if a proposed use is located in the R-3 zoning district and is abutting or across from a parcel in the R-1 zoning district, then a site plan review permit is required. Table 20.32-1 lists out all cases that require a site plan review permit pursuant to this chapter. Figure 20.32-1 illustrates the concept. 
B.  A site plan review permit (with a public hearing and public notice per Section 20.68.050.E and Chapter 20.70) shall also be required for a proposed use in a high impact zoning district that is abutting or across from either: 
1.  A developed parcel that is zoned planned development with a use similar to a permitted use within the corresponding low impact zoning district; or, 
2.  A parcel outside the Merced city limits with a use similar to a permitted use within the corresponding low impact zoning district. 
C.  The director of development services may refer any application to the planning commission for review and final decision.

20.38.030 - Required parking spaces. 
A.  Number of Spaces. All land uses shall provide a minimum number of off-street parking spaces as specified in Table 20.38-1 (Off-Street Parking Requirements), except as provided in Section 20.38.050 (Parking Reductions). 
B.  Unlisted Uses. 
1.  The director of development services shall determine the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for land uses not listed in Table 20.38-1 based on the requirements for the most comparable use in this chapter or an analysis of parking requirements for similar uses in other jurisdictions or state or national standards. 
2.  Off-street parking requirements for unlisted land uses shall be based on the parking requirements of similar uses in Table 20.38-1. 
3.  The director of development services may require the preparation of a parking demand study at the expense of the applicant to determine the parking requirement for unlisted uses. 
C.  Mixed or Multiple Uses. When more than one (1) land use is conducted on a parcel, the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces shall be the sum of the number of parking spaces required for each individual use. 
D.  Unknown Uses. 
1.  The director of development services shall determine the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for nonresidential "shell" structures with no identified tenants. 
2.  Off-street parking requirements for nonresidential "shell" structures shall be based on anticipated tenants for the structures, as determined by the director. 
E.  Units of Measurement. 
1.  For the purpose of this chapter, "floor area," in the case of offices, merchandising or service types of uses, means the gross floor area used or intended to be used by tenants, or for service to the public as customers, patrons, clients, or patients, including areas occupied by fixtures and equipment used for display or sale or merchandise. It shall not include areas used principally for nonpublic purposes such as incidental repair, processing or packaging of merchandise, for show windows, for restrooms, for utilities, or for dressing rooms, fitting rooms, or alteration rooms. Unless additional information is provided by the applicant, these "non-public areas" will be assumed to be fifteen (15) percent of the total gross floor area and will not be used in calculating floor area for parking purposes. 
2.  In indoor or outdoor places of assembly in which spectators or patrons occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each twenty (20) inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of determining off-street parking facilities. 
3.  When units of measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in requirements of a fractional space, fractions of spaces over one-half (½) shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
F.  Conforming Status. Structures or uses established prior to the effective date of the zoning ordinance shall not be deemed nonconforming by reason of providing fewer off-street parking spaces than required by Table 20.38-1. However, no such structure or use may further reduce the number of provided off-street parking spaces below the requirements of this chapter. 
G.  Additional Required Parking. The planning commission may require more off-street parking than required by Table 20.38-1 if the commission determines that additional parking is needed to serve the proposed use and to minimize adverse impacts on neighboring properties. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.38.040 - General requirements. 
A.  Availability and Use of Spaces. 
1.  Required parking spaces shall be permanently available and maintained for parking purposes for the use they are intended to serve. 
2.  Owners, lessees, tenants, or persons having control of the operation of a use for which parking spaces are required shall not prevent or restrict authorized persons from using these spaces. 
3.  Required parking spaces shall be used exclusively for the temporary parking of vehicles and shall not be used for the sale, lease, display, repair, advertising, or storage of vehicles, trailers, boats, campers, mobile homes, merchandise, or equipment, or for any other use not authorized by the zoning ordinance. 
B.  Location of Parking. 
1.  Required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use they are intended to serve, except as allowed by subsection C below. 
2.  When the required off-street parking for a one-family or two-family structure in any R district is not to be provided in a covered garage or carport, each required car space shall be so located that it may later be covered by a garage or carport structure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Off-Site Parking. 
1.  For multi-family housing and nonresidential uses, the site plan review committee may approve off-site parking if it finds that practical difficulties prevent the parking from being located on the same lot it is intended to serve. 
2.  Off-site parking shall be located within four hundred (400) feet of the use it is intended to serve or another reasonable distance as determined by the site plan review committee. 
3.  If off-site parking is approved, a covenant record, approved by the city attorney, shall be filed with the county recorder. The covenant record shall require the owner of the property where the off-site parking is located to continue to maintain the parking space so long as the building, structure, or improvement is maintained within the city. This covenant shall stipulate that the title and right to use the spaces shall not be subject to multiple covenants or contracts for use, or termination, without prior written consent of the city. 
D.  Parking for Persons with Disabilities. 
1.  Parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be provided in compliance with California Code of Regulations Title 24. 
2.  Parking spaces required for the disabled shall count toward compliance with the number of parking spaces required by Table 20.38-1. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.38.050 - Parking reductions. 
The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces as specified in Table 20.38-1 may be reduced as described below. 
A.  Shared Parking. Multiple land uses on a single parcel or development site may use shared parking facilities when operations for the land uses are not normally conducted during the same hours, or when hours of peak use differ. Requests for the use of shared parking may be approved if: 
1.  A parking demand study approved by the director of development services demonstrates that there will be no substantial conflicts between the land uses' principal hours of operation and periods of peak parking demand; 
2.  The total number of parking spaces required for the land uses does not exceed the number of parking spaces anticipated at periods of maximum use; 
3.  The proposed shared parking facility is located no further than four hundred (400) feet from the primary entrance of the land use which it serves; and, 
4.  A covenant record as described in Section 20.38.040.C.3 shall be recorded. 
B.  Common Parking Facilities. Common parking facilities, public or private, may be provided in lieu of the individual requirements contained in this chapter, provided, the total of such off-street parking facilities, when used together, shall not be less than the sum of the various uses computed separately. Such common facilities shall be approved by the planning commission with a conditional use permit, and the planning commission may grant a reduction in the total required parking for the uses by no more than fifteen (15) percent. 
C.  Low Demand. The number of parking spaces may be reduced if the land use will not utilize the required number of spaces due to the nature of the specific use, as demonstrated by a parking demand study approved by the director of development services. 
D.  Transportation Demand Management Plan. The number of parking spaces may be reduced by the director of development services up to twenty (20) percent if the project applicant prepares a transportation demand management plan which demonstrates a reduction in the demand for off-street parking spaces by encouraging the use of transit, ridesharing, biking, walking, or travel outside of peak hours. 
E.  Bus Stop/Transportation Facility Credit. The number of parking spaces may be reduced by up to five (5) percent for commercial or multiple-family development projects within four hundred (400) feet of a City-approved bus stop. If a commercial or multiple-family development project is located within four hundred (400) feet of a transit center, the project may reduce parking spaces by up to ten (10) percent. 
F.  Mixed-Use Projects. A mixed-use project with commercial and residential units may reduce parking requirements by up to thirty (30) percent as demonstrated by a parking demand analysis approved by the director of development services. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.38.060 - Parking assessment districts. 
If a parking assessment district has been established, a fee may be paid to the city in lieu of providing required off-street parking within the district. 
A.  Exception for Parking Districts. Property located within a district in which special assessments have been or are to be levied for providing public off-street parking shall not be required to provide off-street parking facilities for the ground floor of any such structure. 
B.  Special Assessment Financing. 
1.  In any special assessment proceedings for financing the cost of public off-street parking facilities, any improved property shall be granted a credit against the assessment to be levied, in such ratio as the city Council shall determine, for any improved customer, owner, tenant or employee parking spaces or reasonable access areas. 
2.  In determining the amount of assessment credit, the area of credit shall be improved in accordance with this code. If not so improved at the time of granting the credit, the owner shall cause the area to be so improved within sixty (60) days thereafter, or otherwise the credit shall be removed. A parking space is defined as an area of eight and one-half (8½) by twenty (20) feet in dimension. The determination of the city council as to the amount of "reasonable access" shall be final. 
3.  Areas used for parking of delivery vehicles or other commercial or industrial vehicles, and open areas used for storage or otherwise in the operation of the business, shall not be included in any area of credit. Any area for which a credit for parking is granted shall remain subject to the requirements of this chapter for providing off-street parking. 
C.  In-lieu Parking Fee. In lieu of providing off-street parking within a special assessment parking district, an owner may pay to the city a sum equal to one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00) per parking space, which money shall be deposited in a special fund and used for providing, improving or maintaining off-street parking facilities in said district. 
D.  Additions to Parking Districts. 
1.  Each owner of a property not included within a district in which special assessments are levied for providing public off-street parking, but within four hundred (400) feet of a public parking lot located within such a district, may pay a participation fee to defray the cost of providing required off-street public parking facilities, in exchange for the benefits and the responsibilities of inclusion in said district. Upon payment of the participation fee as provided in Section 20.38.060.D.2 and continuing payment of assessments imposed by the district, the owner of the subject property shall not be required to provide off-street parking facilities for the ground floor of any structure on the property, and may also pay in-lieu parking fees as provided in Section 20.38.060.C. 
2.  The participation fee shall be deposited in a special fund and used for providing, improving, or maintaining off-street parking facilities in said district. The amount of participation fee shall be computed as follows: 
a.  Participation fee = (Basic Charge + Cost Index) 
b.  "Basic charge" is ninety (90) cents per square foot of the subject property, and two hundred forty-five dollars ($245.00) per front foot of the subject property, measured as the subject property's frontage along the public right-of-way with the highest traffic volume. 
c.  "Cost index" is the most current cost index (calculated on an annual basis based on the previous year's Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, published by the U.S. Department of Labor), multiplied by the total square foot and front foot of the subject property. In the event of discontinuation of such index, the index most closely resembling said index.

20.52.030 - General. 
A.  Continuation. A nonconforming parcel, use, or structure may be continued if it was legally established in compliance with all applicable regulations in effect at the time it was established. 
B.  Legally Established Defined. To be considered legally established, a legal nonconforming parcel, use, or structure shall have been physically constructed or in existence, not merely contemplated. Conditional use permits, variances, building permits, or other permits not exercised within the required time do not establish the right to a legal nonconformity unless the parcel, use or structure was under construction (with a valid building permit) at the time of adoption of this ordinance. 
C.  Burden of Proof. Any person asserting a right to a nonconforming use or structure has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the nonconformity was legally established. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.52.040 - Nonconforming parcels. 
A.  Development Permitted. Legally established parcels with nonconforming dimensions (e.g., parcel width and depth) shall be permitted all development rights of the zoning district in which it is located. 
B.  Conformance with Standards. Development on legal nonconforming parcels shall comply with all setback, building coverage, parking, and other standards of the applicable zoning district. 
C.  Adjacent Narrow Parcels. Two (2) or more adjacent parcels in single ownership that are each twenty-five (25) feet or less in width shall be considered a single parcel and may be developed as such. Development on such parcels shall comply with all setback, building coverage, parking, and other applicable standards of the applicable zoning district. 
D.  50-foot Frontages. All other provisions of this title notwithstanding, lots with a minimum frontage of fifty (50) feet may be created if they meet the following criteria: 
1.  The lot is in an "R" district and in a block where at least one-half (½) of the existing lots in the same block are fifty (50) feet wide or less. 
2.  All other applicable lot area and yard requirements shall apply after the lot creation takes place. 
3.  Use of the resulting parcel(s) shall be limited to a maximum of one (1) residential unit on each interior lot or a maximum of two (2) residential units on a corner lot where permitted provided that each unit's driveway is accessed from different sides of the lot. 
4.  Vehicle access to the resulting lots shall be through a shared or alley accessed drive when fronting on a collector or higher order street. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.52.050 - Nonconforming use of land.

2.  The nonconforming use is not moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel. 
B.  Cessation of Use. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of more than thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which the land is located. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.52.060 - Nonconforming use of structures. 
A.  Change in Ownership, Tenancy, or Management. A change in ownership, tenancy, or management of a nonconforming use shall not affect its legal nonconforming status. 
B.  Resuming a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use changed to a conforming use shall not return to a nonconforming use. 
C.  Replacement of a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may not be replaced by another nonconforming use. 
D.  Intensification of Use. 
1.  The enlargement of a structure or site occupied by a nonconforming use, or the intensification in any way of the operation of a nonconforming use, shall require the approval of a minor use permit. 
2.  To approve a proposed intensification to a nonconforming use, the director of development services shall make all minor use permit findings (Chapter 20.68) in addition to the findings in Section 20.52.090 (Findings). 
E.  Discontinuation of Use. A nonconforming use discontinued for six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three-year period shall not be reestablished and may be replaced only by a conforming use. 
F.  Nonconforming Use of Land and Structure in Combination. Where a property contains a nonconforming use of land and a nonconforming use within a structure, the removal or destruction of the structure shall require the elimination of the nonconforming use of land. 
G.  Grocery Stores in Residential Zoning Districts. 
1.  A grocery store located in a residential zoning district may be enlarged, constructed, or reopened after discontinuance or abandonment with the approval of a conditional use permit. 
2.  In considering such an application, the planning commission shall determine whether such approval would adversely impact the established pattern of area development. The planning commission shall consider the traffic generated by the use, the nature of outside storage, loading and parking, and the visual appearance of the use, in addition to considering the location, size, design, and operating characteristics of the use. 
H.  Reconstruction of a Residential Structure. An applicant may reconstruct a single-family home or duplex upon the approval of a minor use permit. Reconstruction shall not deviate from the original development standards, including total floor area, degree of nonconformity of yards, and off-street parking standards.

Alterations to a nonconforming structure that do not increase or exacerbate the nonconforming aspect of the structure are permitted by right, provided the project complies will all other applicable standards and regulations. The proposed project may also require permits and approvals for other reasons not related to its nonconforming status. 
2.  Alterations Requiring a Minor Use Permit. 
a.  Alterations to a nonconforming structure that increase or exacerbate the nonconforming aspect of the structure require the approval of a minor use permit. For example, a project that further increases the floor area of a structure when a floor area ratio that is already greater than allowed in the applicable zoning district would require a minor use permit. 
b.  Alteration to a nonconforming structure shall comply with setback requirement of the applicable zoning district. 
c.  To approve such an alteration, the director of development services shall make all minor use permit findings (Chapter 20.68) in addition to the findings in Section 20.52.090 (Findings). 
3.  Substantial Demolition. 
a.  If a nonconforming structure is "substantially demolished" as part of an alteration or addition, the structure shall be brought into full compliance with the requirements of the zoning ordinance (i.e., legal nonconforming status shall be lost). 
b.  A substantial demolition shall mean the removal or replacement of: 
(1)  Fifty (50) percent or more of the lineal footage of existing interior and exterior walls; or, 
(2)  Fifty (50) percent or more of the area of existing floor, ceilings, and roof structures. 
c.  Determination of a substantial demolition shall include all repairs, alterations, and additions cumulatively made to the property over the preceding five (5) years. 
B.  Involuntary Damage or Destruction. 
1.  Nonconforming structures damaged or destroyed by earthquake, fire, flood, or other calamity may be repaired or reconstructed provided that the nonconforming aspects of the structure are not increased or exacerbated. 
2.  The repair or reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall begin within one (1) year and shall be completed within three (3) years. The director of development services may approve an extension of two (2) additional years to complete reconstruction of the demolished structure if the delay was caused by circumstances over which the applicant has no fault or control. 
C.  Moved Structures. A nonconforming structure that is moved to a new location shall conform to all standards that apply in its new location. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.52.080 - Maintenance and repair. 
A.  Public Safety. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent compliance with the orders of any city official to strengthen or restore a structure to safe condition.

Chapter 20.56 - DENSITY BONUS 
 
20.56.010 - Purpose. 
This chapter provides incentives for the production of housing for very low-income, low-income, and senior households and for the production of housing for moderate-income households residing in condominium and planned development projects. In enacting this chapter, it is the city's intent to facilitate the development of affordable housing through the granting of density bonuses and to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the city's general plan housing element. This chapter is enacted under the authority of Government Code Sections 65915 through 65917.5 and the definitions in Government Code Sections 65915 through 65917.5 are incorporated by reference into this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.56.020 - Density bonus; incentives. 
A.  General. 
1.  The city shall grant a density bonus and other incentives to an applicant for a housing development of five (5) or more units if they meet the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  The deed restriction and other applicable documents, approved by city attorney, of a property subject to density bonus shall include a period of continuation of affordability not less than thirty (30) years or a longer period of time. 
3.  Neither the granting of an incentive nor the granting of a density bonus shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning ordinance amendment, or other discretionary approval. 
B.  Density Bonus - Minimum Requirement (Target Units). The city shall grant a density bonus to an applicant for a housing development of five (5) or more units who seeks a density bonus and agrees to construct at least one (1) of the following: 
1.  Very Low-Income. Five (5) percent of the total units of the housing development as target units affordable to very low-income households; 
2.  Low-Income. Ten (10) percent of the total units of the housing development as target units affordable to low-income households; 
3.  Moderate-Income. Ten (10) percent of the total units of a newly constructed condominium project or planned development as target units affordable to moderate-income households, provided all the units are offered for purchase; or, 
4.  Senior. A senior citizen housing development of thirty-five (35) units or more, or a mobile home park that limits residency based on age requirements for housing older persons under Civil Code Section 798.76 or 799.5. 
C.  Density BonusCalculation of Bonus Units. 
1.  In determining the number of density bonus units to be granted under Subsection B above, the maximum residential density for the site shall be multiplied by 0.20 for Subsections B.1, B.2 and B.4 above and by 0.05 for Subsection B.3 above, unless a lesser number is selected by the developer. 
a.  Very Low-Income. For each one (1) percent increase above five (5) percent in the percentage of units affordable to very low-income households, the density bonus is increased by two and one-half (2½) percent up to a maximum of thirty-five (35) percent. 
b.  Lower-Income. For each one (1) percent increase above ten (10) percent in the percentage of units affordable to lower-income households, the density bonus is increased by one and one-half (1.5) percent up to a maximum of thirty-five (35) percent. 
c.  Moderate-Income. For each one (1) percent increase above ten (10) percent of the percentage of units affordable to moderate-income households, the density bonus is increased by one (1) percent up to a maximum of thirty-five (35) percent. 
d.  Senior. For senior housing, the density bonus shall be twenty (20) percent of the number of senior housing units. 
2.  The density bonus units shall not be included when determining the number of target units required to qualify for a density bonus. When calculating the required number of target units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next larger number. 
3.  The developer may request a lesser percentage of density bonus than the project is entitled to. Regardless of the number of target units, no housing development is entitled to a density bonus of more than thirty-five (35) percent. 
D.  Density Bonus Summary. Table 20.56-1 summarizes the density bonus information described in this subsection. 
E.  Incentives. Subject to the findings included in Section 20.56.080 (Application Requirements), when a developer seeks a density bonus, the city shall grant incentives listed in Section 20.56.070 (Modifying Development Standards as an Incentive) as follows: 
1.  One (1) incentive for a project that includes at least ten (10) percent of the total units for low-income households, at least five (5) percent for very low-income households, or at least ten (10) percent for persons and families of moderate income in a condominium or planned development.

When an applicant for a housing development donates land to the city as provided for in this section, the applicant is entitled to a fifteen (15) percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the zoning ordinance and general plan land use element for the entire development. For each one (1) percent increase above the minimum ten (10) percent land donation described in Section B.2 below, the density bonus shall be increased by one (1) percent, up to a maximum of thirty-five (35) percent. This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density required by Section 20.56.020 (Density Bonus; Incentives), up to a maximum combined density bonus of thirty-five (35) percent if an applicant seeks both the increase required under this Section 20.56.020 (Density Bonus; Incentives). When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next larger number. An applicant is not eligible for an increase in density bonus for the donation of land required by the city's parkland dedication ordinance or for any other legally required land dedication. 
B.  Eligibility. A housing development applicant is eligible for the density bonus described in this section if the city makes all of the following findings: 
1.  The applicant will donate and transfer the land no later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application. 
2.  The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low-income households in an amount of at least ten (10) percent of the number of residential units of the proposed development, or will permit construction of a greater percentage of units if proposed by the developer. 
3.  The transferred land is at least one (1) acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of at least forty (40) units, has the appropriate general plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development as very low-income housing, and is now or at the time of construction will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure. The land must also have the appropriate zoning and development standards to make the development of the very low-income units feasible. No later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development, the transferred land will have all of the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the development of the very low-income housing units on the transferred land. 
4.  The transferred land and the affordable units constructed on the land will be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with Sections 20.56.060.B and C, which restriction will be recorded on the property at the time of dedication. 
5.  The land will be transferred to the city or to a housing developer approved by the city. The city may require the applicant to identify a developer of the very low-income units and to require that the land be transferred to that developer.

A.  Timing of Construction. Target units shall be constructed concurrently with non-restricted units or pursuant to a schedule included in the density bonus housing agreement. 
B.  Continued Affordability-Rent. Target units offered for rent for low-income and very low-income households shall be made available for rent at an affordable rent as defined in state law and shall remain restricted and affordable to the designated income group for a minimum period of thirty (30) years. A longer period of time may be specified if required by any construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program applicable to the housing development. 
C.  Continued Affordability-For Sale. Target units offered for sale to very low-, low-, or moderate income households in condominiums and planned developments shall be sold at an affordable ownership cost as defined in state law. 
1.  The maximum resale price homes to very-low or low-income households shall be the lower of (1) fair market value, or (2) the seller's initial purchase price, increased by the lesser of (i) the rate of increase of area median income during the seller's ownership, or (ii) the rate at which the consumer price index increased during the seller's ownership. The seller of the unit shall retain the market value at the time of sale of any capital improvements made by the seller, the down payment, and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation. 
2.  If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value. 
D.  Initial Occupants. The initial occupant of the moderate-income units that are directly related to the receipt of the density bonus units in a condominium project or a planned unit development must be persons or families of moderate income. Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall recapture any initial subsidy and its proportionate share of appreciation, equal to (1) the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sales price to the moderate income household, plus the amount of any down-payment assistance or mortgage assistance ("initial subsidy") plus (2) the ratio of the initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale ("proportionate share of appreciation"). 
E.  Location and Design. Target units shall be built on site and shall be dispersed within the housing development. The number of bedrooms of the target units shall be equivalent to the bedroom mix of the non-target units of the housing development, except that the developer may include a higher proportion of target units with more bedrooms. The design and appearance of the target units shall be compatible with the design of the total housing development. Housing developments shall comply with all applicable development standards, except those which may be modified as provided by this section. 
F.  Parking. 
1.  Upon the request of the applicant, the city may not require a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, of a development meeting the criteria of section 20.56.020 (Density Bonus; Incentives) that exceeds the ratios in Table 20.56-3 (Maximum Required Parking). 
Table 20.56-3 Maximum Required Parking

Parking Spaces 
01 	1 
23 	2 
4 or more 	2.5 
 
2.  If the total number of parking spaces required for a development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this section, a development may provide "on-site parking" through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on-street parking. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)  
20.56.070 - Modifying development standards as an incentive. 
A.  Eligible Incentives. Incentives requested under Sections 20.56.020 (Density Bonus; Incentives) and 20.56.030 (Land Donation) may include the following: 
1.  A reduction of a site development standard or a modification of a zoning ordinance requirement which exceeds the minimum building standards provided in Health and Safety Code Section 18901 and following and which result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions, including, but not limited to the incentives shown in Table 20.56-4 (Incentives). 
2.  Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing development if nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the city finds that the proposed nonresidential uses are compatible with the housing development and with existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing development will be located. (Approval of mixed use zoning is considered six (6) incentives.) 
3.  Other regulatory incentives proposed by the developer or the city which result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. The city has the right to establish the incentive value for any other incentive proposed by an applicant. 
Table 20.56-4 Incentives 
Reduced minimum parcel size or dimension 	Each reduction of 10 percent is considered one incentive. 
Reduced minimum setback: front or rear 	Reduction in combined front and rear setbacks is considered one incentive, except that the reduction must leave at least a 5-foot setback from both front and rear property lines. 
Reduced side setbacks 	Reduction in combined side setbacks is considered one incentive, except that the reduction must leave at least one 5-foot setback. 
Increased maximum parcel coverage 	Each increase of 10 percent is considered one incentive. 
Reduced open space requirement 	Each decrease of 10 percent in the open space requirement is considered one incentive. 
Increased maximum structure height 	Each additional story in height is considered one incentive, except when the total structure height exceeds four stories. In that case, each additional increase by a partial story is one incentive and each additional increase by a full story is two (2) incentives. 
Waiver of a design standard from the City's Engineering Standards 	Each waiver of a design standard is considered one incentive. (Waivers of General Plan design standards are not permitted, for example: connectivity, community character.) 
 
B.  Necessity. An applicant may seek a waiver or modification of development standards that will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of Section 20.56.020 (Density Bonus; Incentives) at the densities or with the incentives permitted by this section. The developer shall show that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible. The city may retain a consultant to review the financial report with costs borne by the applicant. 
C.  No Waivers Granted. Under no circumstances shall a waiver of development fees or the installation of public improvements be granted.

To approve a wireless communication facility requiring a site plan review or conditional use permit, the review authority must make the following findings (if applicable) in addition to the findings required by Chapter 20.68 (Permit Requirements) for the applicable permit: 
A.  For a proposed lattice tower located in other than an industrial district, the applicant has demonstrated that there is no feasible alternative to use of a lattice tower at the proposed site or within the search ring. 
B.  The proposed wireless communication facility is designed at the minimal functional height. 
C.  The location for the wireless communication facility minimizes the visibility of the facility from residentially zoned property and minimizes the obstruction of scenic views from residentially zoned property. 
D.  Projection of the antenna or antenna array has been minimized to the greatest extent possible. 
E.  In the case of an application for use of a new site for wireless communication facilities, all reasonable opportunities to locate the facility or to co-locate the facility on an existing structure have been exhausted by the applicant and are not feasible. 
F.  Support towers located in an agricultural zoning district are located and designed to minimize dangers to aerial sprayers. 
G.  Sites near the project area, which are poorly suited for other forms of development, are unavailable for use by the wireless communication facility. 
H.  For planned developments, the underlying land use designation permits and would not be adversely affected by the proposed type of wireless communication facility. For example: in an industrial planned development, a lattice tower may be found to be acceptable while in a residential planned development, a stealth facility or monopole may be found to be acceptable, but a lattice tower would not. To determine the effect of the proposed wireless communication facility on the land use designation and the permit process required, use Table 20.58-2. 
(Ord. No. 2465, § 2(Exhs. A., B.), 9-19-2016)

a.  A proposed Type B antenna array requires the approval of a site plan review permit. 
b.  Any Type B antenna or antenna array considered by the planning division to be a stealth facility may be approved administratively by the planning division if it complies with all applicable standards in this chapter. 
3.  Wireless Communication Facilities with Support Towers. Table 20.58-2 identifies permits required for wireless communication facilities with support towers. Required permits depend on the type of support tower, the height of the facility, and the zoning district in which the facility is located. 
4.  Referral to Planning Commission. The planning division or the site plan review committee may refer any application for a wireless communication facility for review and final decision by the planning commission. In such cases the proposed facility shall require planning commission approval of a conditional use permit. 
5.  State and Federal Regulations. If any provisions of this chapter conflict with any state or federal law, the state or federal law shall prevail over the requirements of this chapter. If an applicant wishes to assert their rights under the federal "shot clock" rule pursuant to FCC Report and Order 14-153 or the State's AB 57, the applicant shall inform the city in writing of such at the time of application and meet all requirements of those regulations and this chapter.

Chapter 20.60 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES 
 
20.60.010 - Purpose. 
It is the intent of this chapter to prevent community-wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult entertainment businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult entertainment businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult entertainment businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult businesses in certain areas. 
This chapter identifies permitted locations for adult entertainment businesses within the City of Merced. Additional permit requirements for adult entertainment business can be found in Chapter 5.58 (Adult Entertainment Businesses) of the Merced Municipal Code.

No fee shall be required for a request for reasonable accommodation, but if the project requires another discretionary permit, then the prescribed fee shall be paid for all other discretionary permits. 
C.  Other Discretionary Permits. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval, then the applicant may file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval.

a.  Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood. 
b.  Whether the accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking. 
c.  Whether granting the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either the city's general plan or an applicable specific plan. 
d.  In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation. 
D.  Rules While Decision is Pending. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect. 
E.  Effective Date. No reasonable accommodation shall become effective until the decision to grant such accommodation shall have become final by reason of the expiration of time to make an appeal.
