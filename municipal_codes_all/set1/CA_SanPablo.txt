1.08.070 Recovery of fees, costs and charges from absentee residential landlords and non-residential property owners.
A.    In accordance with Government Code Section 54988, as amended, the city may collect any fee, cost or charge incurred by the city in:

1.    The abatement of public nuisances;

2.    The correction of any violation of any law or regulation that would also be a violation of Section 1941.1 of the Civil Code;

3.    The enforcement of city zoning ordinances;

4.    The inspection and abatement of violations of Section 13100 of the Health and Safety Code relating to fire protection and city ordinances and regulations relating to fire protection;

5.    The inspection and abatement of violations of the State Housing Law and city ordinances and regulations enforcing the State Housing Law;

6.    The inspection and abatement of violations of the State Building Standards Code and city ordinances and regulations enforcing the State Building Standards Code;

7.    The inspection and abatement of violations of city ordinances and regulations concerning building code standards and requirements.

B.    This section shall not apply to owner-occupied residential dwelling units, or to any enforcement, abatement, correction, or inspection activity regarding a violation in which the violation was evident on the plans that received a building permit.

C.    For purposes of this section, fees, costs and charges shall include, but not be limited to, city staff costs, attorney costs, consultant and expert witness costs, permit fees, fines, late charges and interest. The amount of any fee, cost, or charge shall not exceed such actual costs incurred performing the inspections and enforcement activity.

D.    The fees, costs and charges may become a lien against the property as long as the city first provides the property owner with written notice in plain language of the proposed lien, a description of the basis for the amounts comprising the lien, a minimum of forty-five days after notice to pay the fee, cost, or charge, and an opportunity to appear before the city council and be heard regarding the amount of the proposed lien. The notice shall be mailed by certified mail to the last known address of the property owner, and shall include the date, time and place of the city council hearing. At the hearing, the city council may confirm the lien upon written factual findings based on the evidence introduced at the hearing. The hearing shall not be an opportunity to present evidence on the question of whether a public nuisance existed on the property, such determination having been made at a prior administrative or judicial hearing with the right to appeal.

E.    The lien, in the amount confirmed by the city council, may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are collected. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of ad valorem taxes shall be applicable to the proposed lien, except that if any real property to which the lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the lien that would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to real property and the costs of enforcement relating to the property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

F.    The city council may, in the alternative, cause notice of the lien to be recorded with the Contra Costa county recorder. The lien shall attach upon recordation and shall have the same force, priority, and effect as a judgment lien, not a tax lien. The notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of the property, set forth the last known address of the record owner or possessor, set forth the date upon which the lien was created against the property, and include a description of the real property subject to the lien and the amount of the lien.

G.    The city council may delegate the holding of any or all hearings to a hearing board designated by the city council. Such hearing board shall make a written recommendation to the city council which shall include factual findings based on evidence introduced at the hearing. The city council may adopt the recommendation without further notice of hearing, or may set the matter for a de novo hearing before the city council. Notice in writing of the de novo hearing shall be provided to the property owner at least ten days in advance of the scheduled hearing. (Ord. 02-002 § 1, 2002)

A.    After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision to uphold, cancel or reduce the administrative citation and shall list the reasons for that decision. The hearing officer may establish the amount of the fine based on the facts and circumstances of the violation, including, but not limited to, the length of time the violation existed; the culpability of the owner and willfulness of the violation; the frequency, recurrence and number of violations, related or unrelated, by the same violator; the good faith attempts of the violator to come into compliance; the economic impact of the penalty on the violator; the amount of city staff time which was expended in investigating or addressing the violation, and the amount of administrative fines which have been imposed in similar situations; the extent of the violation and its effect on the public, the environment or neighboring properties; the credibility of the appellant or any witnesses; and any other information relevant to a determination of the fine. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final.

B.    The recipient of the administrative citation shall be served with a copy of the hearing officer’s written decision.

(Ord. 02-006 § 1 (part), 2002)

1.10.150 Recovery of administrative citation fines and costs.
The city may collect any past due administrative citation fines and/or late payment charges by use of all available legal means.

A.    The amount of any unpaid final administrative fine, plus interest, plus any other costs as provided in the chapter, may be declared a lien on such real property as follows:

1.    Notice shall be given to the owner before recordation of the lien, and shall be served in the same manner as a summons in the civil action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 415.10 et seq.;

2.    The lien shall attach when the city records it with the county recorder’s office. The lien shall specify the amount of the lien, the date(s) of the code violations, the date of the final decision, the street address, legal description, and assessor’s parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the record owner of the parcel; and

3.    The lien shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as city taxes are collected.

C.    The city may withhold issuance of licenses, permits and other entitlements to a responsible party on any project, property, or application of any kind whenever an administrative penalty remains unpaid.

D.    In the event a civil action is commenced to collect the administrative penalty, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs associated with the collection of the penalty. Costs include, without limitation, staff time incurred in the collection of the penalty and those costs set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5.

E.    The city may take such other actions as are allowed for enforcement of a civil judgment as provided for pursuant to the Enforcement of Judgment Law, California Code of Civil Procedure § 680.010 et seq. (Ord. 07-001 § 6, 2007; Ord. 02-006 § 1 (part), 2002)

2.52.010 Title.
The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the “employer-employee relations ordinance” of the city. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.020 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to implement Chapter 10, Division 4, Title 1 of the Government Code of the State of California (Section 3500 et seq.) captioned “Local Public Employee Organizations” (the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, or “MMBA”), by providing orderly procedures for the administration of employer-employee relations between the city and its employee organizations. However, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of state law, ordinances, resolutions and rules which establish and regulate the civil service system, or which provide for other methods of administering employer-employee relations. This chapter is intended, instead, to strengthen civil service and other methods of administering employer-employee relations through the establishment of uniform and orderly methods of communications between employees, employee organizations and the city.

It is the purpose of this chapter to provide procedures for meeting and conferring in good faith with recognized employee organizations regarding matters that directly and significantly affect and primarily involve the wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment of employees in appropriate units and that are not preempted by federal or state law. However, nothing herein shall be construed to restrict any legal or inherent exclusive city rights with respect to matters of general legislative or managerial policy, which include, among others: the exclusive right to determine the mission of its constituent departments, commissions, and boards; set standards of service; determine the procedures and standards of selection for employment; direct its employees; take disciplinary action; relieve its employees from duty because of lack of work or for other lawful reasons; determine the content of job classifications; subcontract work; maintain the efficiency of governmental operations; determine the methods, means and personnel by which government operations are to be conducted; take all necessary actions to carry out its mission in emergencies; and exercise complete control and discretion over its organization and the technology of performing its work. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.030 Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

“Appropriate unit” means a unit of employee classes or positions, established pursuant to this chapter.

“City” means the city of San Pablo, and, where appropriate herein, refers to the city council or any duly authorized city representative as herein defined.

“Confidential employee” means an employee who, in the course of his or her duties, has access to confidential information relating to the city’s administration of employer-employee relations.

“Consult/consultation in good faith” means to communicate orally or in writing with all affected recognized employee organizations for the purpose of presenting and obtaining views or advising of proposed actions in a good faith effort to reach a consensus; and, as distinguished from meeting and conferring in good faith regarding matters within the required scope of the meet and confer process, does not involve an exchange of proposals and counterproposals in an endeavor to reach agreement in the form of a memorandum of understanding, nor is it subject to Section 2.52.170 et seq. regarding impasse procedures.

“Day” means calendar day unless expressly stated otherwise.

“Employee relations officer” means the city manager or his/her duly authorized representative.

“Exclusively recognized employee organization” means an employee organization which has been formally acknowledged by the city as the sole employee organization representing the employees in an appropriate representation unit pursuant to this chapter, having the exclusive right to meet and confer in good faith concerning statutorily required subjects pertaining to unit employees, and thereby assuming the corresponding obligation of fairly representing such employees. Such recognition status may not be challenged by another employee organization (1) within twelve months of initial recognition and (2) to take effect during a memorandum of understanding having a term of up to three years.

“Impasse” means that the representatives of the city and a recognized employee organization have reached a point in their meeting and conferring in good faith where their differences on matters to be included in a memorandum of understanding, and concerning which they are required to meet and confer, remain so substantial and prolonged that further meeting and conferring would be futile.

“Management employee” means an employee having responsibility for formulating, administering or managing the implementation of city policies and programs.

“Proof of employee support” means (1) an authorization card recently signed and personally dated by an employee; provided, that the card has not been subsequently revoked in writing by the employee, (2) a verified authorization petition or petitions recently signed and personally dated by an employee, or (3) employee dues deduction authorizations, using the payroll register for the period immediately prior to the date a petition is filed hereunder, except that dues deduction authorizations for more than one employee organization for the account of any one employee shall not be considered as proof of employee support for any employee organization. The only authorization which shall be considered as proof of employee support hereunder shall be the authorization last signed by an employee. The words “recently signed” shall mean within ninety days prior to the filing of such proof of support.

“Supervisory employee” means any employee having authority, in the interest of the city, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action if, in connection with the foregoing, the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.

Terms not defined herein shall have the meanings as set forth in the MMBA. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

G.    A designation of those persons, not exceeding two in number, and their addresses, to whom notice sent by regular United States mail will be deemed sufficient notice on the employee organization for any purpose.

H.    A statement that the employee organization has no restriction on membership based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability or medical condition.

I.    The job classifications or position titles of employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate and the approximate number of member employees therein.

J.    A statement that the employee organization has in its possession proof of employee support as herein defined to establish that a majority of the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate have designated the employee organization to represent them in their employment relations with the city. Such written proof shall be submitted for confirmation to the employee relations officer or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party.

K.    A request that the employee relations officer formally acknowledge the petitioner as the exclusively recognized employee organization representing the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate for the purpose of meeting and conferring in good faith. The petition, including the proof of employee support and all accompanying documentation, shall be declared to be true, correct and complete, under penalty of perjury, by the duly authorized officer(s) of the employee organization executing it. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.050 City response to recognition petition.
Upon receipt of the petition, the employee relations officer shall determine whether:

A.    There has been compliance with the requirements of the recognition petition; and

B.    The proposed representation unit is an appropriate unit in accordance with Section 2.52.100.

If an affirmative determination is made by the employee relations officer on the foregoing two matters, he/she shall so inform the petitioning employee organization, shall give written notice of such request for recognition to the employees in the unit and shall take no action on said request for thirty days thereafter. If either of the foregoing matters are not affirmatively determined, the employee relations officer shall offer to consult thereon with such petitioning employee organization and, if such determination thereafter remains unchanged, shall inform that organization of the reasons therefor in writing.

The petitioning employee organization may appeal such determination in accordance with Section 2.52.130. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.060 Open period for filing challenging petition.
Within thirty days of the date written notice was given to affected employees that a valid recognition petition for an appropriate unit has been filed, any other employee organization may file a competing request to be formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization of the employees in the same or in an overlapping unit (one which corresponds with respect to some, but not all, of the classifications or positions set forth in the recognition petition being challenged), by filing a petition evidencing proof of employee support in the unit claimed to be appropriate of at least thirty percent and otherwise in the same form and manner as set forth in Section 2.52.040. If such challenging petition seeks establishment of an overlapping unit, the employee relations officer shall call for a hearing on such overlapping petitions for the purpose of ascertaining the more appropriate unit, at which time the petitioning employee organizations shall be heard. Thereafter, the employee relations officer shall determine the appropriate unit or units in accordance with the standards in Section 2.52.100. The petitioning employee organizations shall have fifteen days from the date notice of such unit determination is communicated to them by the employee relations officer to amend their petitions to conform to such determination or to appeal such determination pursuant to Section 2.52.130. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.070 Granting recognition without an election.
If the petition is in order, and the proof of support shows that a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit have designated the petitioning employee organization to represent them, and if no other employee organization filed a challenging petition, the petitioning employee organization and the employee relations officer shall request the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service, or another agreed upon neutral third party, to review the count, form, accuracy and propriety of the proof of support. If the neutral third party makes an affirmative determination, the employee relations officer shall formally acknowledge the petitioning employee organization as the exclusive recognized employee organization for the designated unit. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.080 Election procedure.
Where recognition is not granted pursuant to Section 2.52.070, the employee relations officer shall arrange for a secret ballot election to be conducted by a party agreed to by the employee relations officer and the concerned employee organization(s), in accordance with such party’s rules and procedures subject to the provisions of this chapter. All employee organizations who have duly submitted petitions which have been determined to be in conformance with this chapter shall be included on the ballot. The ballot shall also reserve to employees the choice of representing themselves individually in their employment relations with the city. Employees entitled to vote in such election shall be those persons employed in regular permanent positions within the designated appropriate unit who were employed during the pay period immediately prior to the date which ended at least fifteen days before the date the election commences, including those who did not work during such period because of illness, vacation or other authorized leaves of absence, and who are employed by the city in the same unit on the date of the election. An employee organization shall be formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization for the designated appropriate unit following an election or run-off election if it received a numerical majority of all valid votes cast in the election. In an election involving three or more choices, where none of the choices receives a majority of the valid votes cast, a run-off election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the largest number of valid votes cast; the rules governing an initial election being applicable to a run-off election. There shall be no more than one valid election under this chapter pursuant to any petition in a twelve-month period affecting the same unit. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on a third party to conduct an election, the election shall be conducted by the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service.

Costs of conducting elections shall be borne in equal shares by the city and by each employee organization appearing on the ballot. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.090 Procedure for decertification of exclusively recognized employee organization.
A decertification petition alleging that the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in an established appropriate unit may be filed with the employee relations officer only during the month of March of any year following the first full year of recognition or during the thirty-day period commencing one hundred twenty days prior to the termination date of a memorandum of understanding then having been in effect less than three years, whichever occurs later. A decertification petition may be filed by two or more employees or their representative, or an employee organization, and shall contain the following information and documentation declared by the duly authorized signatory under penalty of perjury to be true, correct and complete:

A.    The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner and a designated representative authorized to receive notices or requests for further information.

B.    The name of the established appropriate unit and of the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization sought to be decertified as a representative of that unit.

D.    Proof of employee support that at least thirty percent of the employees in the established appropriate unit no longer desire to be represented by the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization. Such proof shall be submitted for confirmation to the employee relations officer or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party within the time limits specified in the first paragraph of this section.

An employee organization may, in satisfaction of the decertification petition requirements hereunder, file a petition under this section in the form of a recognition petition that evidences proof of employee support of at least thirty percent, that includes the allegation and information required under this section, and otherwise conforms to the requirements of Section 2.52.040.

The employee relations officer shall initially determine whether the petition has been filed in compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter. If his/her determination is in the negative, he/she shall offer to consult thereon with the representative(s) of such petitioning employees or employee organization and, if such determination thereafter remains unchanged, shall return such petition to the employees or employee organization with a statement of the reasons therefor in writing. The petitioning employees or employee organization may appeal such determination in accordance with Section 2.52.130. If the determination of the employee relations officer is in the affirmative, or if his negative determination is reversed on appeal, he/she shall give written notice of such decertification or recognition petition to the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization and to unit employees.

The employee relations officer shall thereupon arrange for a secret ballot election to be held on or about fifteen days after such notice to determine the wishes of unit employees as to the question of decertification and, if a recognition petition was duly filed hereunder, the question of representation. Such election shall be conducted in conformance with Section 2.52.080. During the “open period” specified in the first paragraph of this section, the employee relations officer may, on his/her own motion, when he/she has reason to believe that a majority of unit employees no longer wish to be represented by the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization, give notice to that organization and all unit employees that he/she will arrange for an election to determine that issue. In such event any other employee organization may within fifteen days of such notice file a recognition petition in accordance with this subsection, which the employee relations officer shall act on in accordance with this subsection.

If, pursuant to this section, a different employee organization is formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization, such organization shall be bound by all the terms and conditions of any memorandum of understanding then in effect for its remaining term. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.100 Policy and standards for determination of appropriate units.
The policy objectives in determining the appropriateness of units shall be the effect of a proposed unit on (1) the efficient operations of the city and its compatibility with the primary responsibility of the city and its employees to effectively and economically serve the public, and (2) providing employees with effective representation based on recognized community of interest considerations. These policy objectives require that the appropriate unit shall be the broadest feasible grouping of positions that share an identifiable community of interest. Factors to be considered shall be:

A.    Similarity of the general kinds of work performed, types of qualifications required, and the general working conditions.

B.    History of representation in the city and similar employment; except, however, that no unit shall be deemed to be an appropriate unit solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized.

C.    Consistency with the organizational patterns of the city.

D.    Effect of differing legally mandated impasse resolution procedures.

E.    Number of employees and classifications, and the effect on the administration of employer-employee relations created by the fragmentation of classifications and proliferation of units.

F.    Effect on the classification structure and impact on the stability of the employer-employee relationship of dividing a single or related classifications among two or more units.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, managerial, supervisory and confidential responsibilities, as defined in Section 2.52.030, are determining factors in establishing appropriate units hereunder, and therefore managerial, supervisory and confidential employees may only be included in a unit consisting solely of managerial, supervisory or confidential employees, respectively. Managerial, supervisory and confidential employees may not represent any employee organization which represents other employees. Professional employees have the right to be represented separately from nonprofessional employees.

Peace officers may be required, and have the right, to be represented in separate units composed solely of such peace officers. These units shall not be represented by an organization that, directly or indirectly, is subordinate to any other employee organization which includes non-peace officers.

The employee relations officer shall, after notice to and consultation with affected employee organizations, allocate new classifications or positions, delete eliminated classifications or positions, and retain, reallocate or delete modified classifications or positions from units in accordance with the provisions of this section. The decision of the employee relations officer shall be final. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.110 Procedure for modification of established appropriate units.
Requests by employee organizations for modifications of established appropriate units may be considered by the employee relations officer only during the period specified in Section 2.52.090. Such requests shall be submitted in the form of a recognition petition and, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 2.52.040, shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts and citations in support of the proposed modified unit in terms of the policies and standards set forth in Section 2.52.100. The employee relations officer shall process such petitions as other recognition petitions under this chapter.

The employee relations officer may by his or her own motion propose that an established unit be modified. The employee relations officer shall give written notice of the proposed modification(s) to any affected employee organization and shall hold a meeting concerning the proposed modification(s), at which time all affected employee organizations shall be heard. Thereafter the employee relations officer shall determine the composition of the appropriate unit or units in accordance with Section 2.52.100, and shall give written notice of such determination to the affected employee organizations. The employee relations officer’s determination may be appealed as provided in Section 2.52.130. If a unit is modified pursuant to the motion of the employee relations officer hereunder, employee organizations may thereafter file recognition petitions seeking to become the exclusively recognized employee organization for such new appropriate unit or units pursuant to Section 2.52.040. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.120 Procedure for processing severance requests.
An employee organization may file a request to become the recognized employee organization of a unit alleged to be appropriate that consists of a group of employees who are already a part of a larger established unit represented by another recognized employee organization. The timing, form and processing of such request shall be as specified in Section 2.52.110 for modification requests. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.130 Appeals.
An employee organization aggrieved by an appropriate unit determination of the employee relations officer, or an employee organization aggrieved by a determination of the employee relations officer that a recognition petition (Section 2.52.040), challenging petition (Section 2.52.060), decertification petition (Section 2.52.090), unit modification petition (Section 2.52.110)—or employees aggrieved by a determination of the employee relations officer that a decertification petition (Section 2.52.090) or severance request (Section 2.52.120)—has not been filed in compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter, may, within ten days of notice of the employee relations officer’s final decision, request to submit the matter to mediation by the State Mediation and Conciliation Service, or may, in lieu thereof or thereafter, appeal such determination to the city council for final decision within fifteen days of notice of the employee relations officer’s determination or the termination of mediation proceedings, whichever is later.

Appeals to the city council shall be filed in writing with the city clerk, and a copy thereof served on the employee relations officer. The city council shall commence to consider the matter within thirty days of the filing of the appeal.

Any decision of the city council on the use of such procedure, and/or any decision of the city council determining the substance of the dispute, shall be final and binding. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.170 Initiation of impasse procedures.
If the meet and confer process has reached an impasse as defined in Section 2.52.030, either party may initiate the impasse procedures by filing with the other party a written request for an impasse meeting, together with a statement of its position on all issues. An impasse meeting shall then be scheduled promptly by the employee relations officer. The purpose of such meeting shall be:

A.    To review the position of the parties in a final effort to reach agreement on a memorandum of understanding; and

B.    If the impasse is not resolved, to discuss arrangements for the utilization of the impasse procedures provided herein. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

All mediation proceedings shall be private. The mediator shall make no public recommendation, nor take any public position at any time concerning the issues.

B.    If the parties fail to agree to submit the dispute to mediation or fail to agree on the selection of a mediator, or the mediator fails to resolve the dispute through mediation within thirty days after his or her appointment, either party may request that the parties’ differences be submitted to a fact-finding panel.

C.    The fact-finding panel shall be comprised, shall be paid for, and shall follow the procedures and timelines as set forth in Government Code Sections 3505.4 and 3505.5.

7.    The overall compensation presently received by the employees, including direct wage compensation, vacations, holidays, and other excused time, insurance and pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of employment, and all other benefits received.

8.    Any other facts, not confined to those specified in subsections (D)(1) through (7) of this section, inclusive, which are normally or traditionally taken into consideration in making the findings and recommendations. Those other facts include, but are not limited to: maintaining compensation relationships between all job classifications and positions within the city; other legislatively determined and projected demands on city resources, i.e., budgetary priorities that the city council has established; allowance for equitable compensation increases for other employees and employee groups for the corresponding fiscal period(s); revenue projections not to exceed currently authorized tax and rates for the relevant fiscal year(s); assurance of sufficient and sound budgetary reserves; and constitutional, statutory (and municipal code) limitations on the level and use of revenues and expenditures.

The fact-finders shall submit, in writing, any findings of fact and recommended terms of settlement to the parties before they are made available to the public. The city shall make these findings and recommendations publicly available within ten days after their receipt.

This subsection is not intended to grant any greater rights to the employee organizations than as set forth in Government Code Section 3505.7, as it may be amended from time to time. (Ord. 2012-001 § 1 (part), 2012: Ord. 2011-004 § 1 (part), 2011)

2.52.190 Costs of impasse procedures.
The cost for the services of a mediator and fact-finder or chairperson of a fact-finding panel utilized by the parties, and other mutually incurred costs of mediation and fact-finding, shall be borne equally by the city and exclusively recognized employee organization unless otherwise provided for by Government Code Section 3500 et seq.

In consideration of and as a condition of initial and continued employment by the city, employees recognize that any such actions by them are in violation of their conditions of employment except as expressly otherwise provided by legally preemptive state or contrary local law. In the event employees engage in such actions, they shall subject themselves to discipline up to and including termination, and may be replaced, to the extent such actions are not prohibited by preemptive law; and employee organizations may thereby forfeit rights accorded them under city law or contract.

2.60.010 Purpose and intent.
A.    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to prescribe requirements for operation of the official police towing services for the city. It is the purpose of the city council in enacting this chapter to provide qualified reasonably priced towing operations for towing and storage of motor vehicles on a rotational basis.

B.    The city council has determined after review of potential towing operations that:

1.    Three or preferably more towing operations are required to provide a higher level of service to the city and to the public;

2.    There exists on a current and continuing basis an excessive number of abandoned vehicles that require removal, and more than one towing operation is required to accomplish efficient and timely removal of vehicles to benefit this city and for the public health, safety and welfare;

3.    Contracting with towing operations to establish rotational towing services helps to curtail the practice of “chasing” where tow trucks race one another to an accident scene in competition for business. (Ord. 04-012 § 1 (part), 2004)

2.60.020 Definitions.
As used in this chapter:

“Attendant” or “operator” means an individual responsible for the operation of a tow truck.

“Chief of police” means and includes chief of police or his or her designee.

“City” means city of San Pablo.

“County” means Contra Costa County.

“Official police towing service” means the contracting tow operations selected by the city council to be included on a rotational towing list and utilized by the San Pablo police department on an on call basis.

“Person” includes any natural person, corporation, firm, association, organization, partnership, limited liability company, business or trust.

“Removal of vehicles” means all circumstances authorizing a San Pablo police department officer or other city employee to request towing of a motor vehicle pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 22651 or other applicable law.

“Towing operation” or “towing service” means any activity of towing and/or storing of vehicles, including the removal of vehicles from private property, and the performance of other services incident to towing, for compensation within the city.

“Tow truck” is a motor vehicle which has been altered or designed and equipped for, and primarily used in the business of, transporting vehicles by means of a crane, hoist, tow bar, tow line, or dolly or is otherwise primarily used to render assistance to other vehicles. A “roll back carrier” designed to carry up to two vehicles is also a tow truck. A trailer for hire that is being used to transport a vehicle is also a tow truck. A tow truck does not include an automobile dismantler’s tow vehicle or a repossessor’s tow vehicle as defined in California Vehicle Code Section 615. (Ord. 04-012 § 1 (part), 2004)

2.60.030 Scope of chapter.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to towing operations which submit bids and contract with the city to provide official police towing services. (Ord. 04-012 § 1 (part), 2004)

2.60.050 Compliance with other laws, regulations and ordinances.
None of the provisions of this chapter shall exempt towing operations from compliance with the California Vehicle Code or any other applicable state or federal law or regulation, county or city ordinance. Each tow truck shall meet all state and federal standards for equipment, weight and safety. (Ord. 04-012 § 1 (part), 2004)

2.60.060 Payment of tow and storage charges.
The owner or operator of the towed motor vehicle, not the city, shall pay the towing operation for towing and storage fees and charges. Nothing contained in the chapter is intended to imply that the cost of towing service or storage of motor vehicles is to be charged or assumed by the city. The towing operation shall receive reimbursement for its service separate and apart from the city and its officials unless reimbursement is specifically approved in advance in writing by the San Pablo chief of police or San Pablo city manager. (Ord. 04-012 § 1 (part), 2004)

2.60.070 Maximum rates and charges for towing operations.
Prior to bid, the city council shall adopt a resolution establishing certain maximum standard towing rates, storage charges and other towing operation fees that can be charged by contracting towing operations.

2.    Impoundment rates for day and night and whether an after-hours release fee is charged;

3.    Hourly rates for extended service, based on a twenty minute maximum normal time after arrival at the location for the tow;

4.    Daily storage fees and list of other miscellaneous tow operation fees.

D.    Bids shall also state the following:

1.    Whether the tow operation will provide service calls for the San Pablo police department twenty-four hours a day, including holidays;

2.    The tow operation’s daily business hours;

3.    The name, title, home address and business address and telephone number of the individual who submits the contract bid on behalf of the tow operation;

9.    The names and address of the individual designated by the applicant towing operation to receive all city notices including any notice of revocation or cancellation of the official police services contract and tow truck operator’s permit;

10.    The extent to which the applicant is willing to offer free or reduced price service for city vehicles. No towing operation or towing service subject to this chapter shall charge the City more than $35 as a flat rate fee for tire changes for city vehicles. Each towing operation or towing service subject to this chapter shall provide up to five (5) free tows per year at the request of the City;

11.    A copy of the tow operation’s current permit or certification issued by the California Highway Patrol;

12.    Such other information as is required in the notice inviting bids. (Ord. 10-002 § 1, 2010; Ord. 04-012 § 1 (part), 2004)

2.60.090 Selection of official police towing services.
A.    After the bid opening, the city clerk shall set a hearing before the city council giving notice of the time so set at least five days before the date of the hearing to all persons submitting bids.

B.    In reaching a decision on the selection of towing operations, the city council shall take into account the following:

1.    Whether the towing operation applicants can satisfy the insurance, business license, and tow operator permit requirements of this chapter;

2.    Whether the applicants are qualified on the basis of prior experience in the towing operation business and financial responsibility;

3.    The type and physical condition of the towing equipment and storage facilities. All tow vehicles and equipment must comply with all state or applicable federal requirements;

4.    Whether the applicants have a history of prior tow operation permit or contract revocation or cancellation in this city or other cities;

5.    Whether the applicants can reasonably conduct an official police towing service which will comply with the requirements of this chapter;

6.    Whether the applicants will accept all tows requested by the city, including tows of abandoned or dismantled vehicles and/or tows requiring special equipment.

Where an open market purchase will be less than five thousand dollars, the purchasing officer may, but need not, solicit informal bids, where in his or her judgment such a solicitation would be advantageous to the city. For those purchases where informal bids are not requested, the city manager shall adopt regulations to encourage city staff to encourage and maximize the award of such contracts to small local businesses. (Ord. 2016-002 § 2, 2016; Ord. 2010-005 § 3, 2010; Ord. 2009-008, § 6, 11-16-09; Ord. 98-004 § 7, 1998: Ord. 84-017 § 3, 1984: Ord. 672 § 9, 1975)

3.16.100 Lowest responsible bidder and local business preference.
A.    For purposes of this chapter, “lowest responsible bidder” means that bidder which best responds in price, quality, service, fitness, or capacity to the particular requirements of the city, as recommended by the city manager or determined by the city council. Price alone shall not be the determining factor but shall be considered along with other factors including, but not limited to, the ability, capacity and skill of the bidder; whether the bidder can perform promptly, without delay or interference; the character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder; the quality of the bidder’s performance of previous city contracts or service; previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or service; sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform; quality, availability, and adaptability of the supplies or contractual service to the particular use required and conformance to specifications; ability to provide future maintenance and service; and the number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.

B.    Whenever it is recommended that the bid be awarded to other than the lowest monetary bidder, reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard shall be given to such bidder before the award is made.

C.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, and to the extent not prohibited under state or federal law, regulations, or funding restrictions, formal or informal bids for nonpublic projects, supplies, services and equipment that are made by small local businesses, as defined by this section, shall be tabulated as if five percent below the figure actually set forth in the bid for the purpose of determining the lowest responsible bidder, so long as the bids are otherwise equal in responsibility and quality. The total amount of preference granted in a single bid shall not exceed five thousand dollars. The city, when seeking bids for commodities, supplies, equipment, and nonprofessional services, will notify bidders that bids will be evaluated on the basis of a local preference of five percent of the bid price.

D.    A business shall be deemed a “small local business” for the purposes of this chapter if it has a place of business (other than a post office box) within the city and has a valid, current business license issued by the city. To qualify as a small local business under this chapter, the business shall submit with its bid a completed affidavit that documents that it has a facility within the city of San Pablo and with a San Pablo address; that it will attribute sales tax from the sale to the City of San Pablo, if applicable; that the business has had a city of San Pablo business license for at least three months prior to the opening of the bid; and that it either employs fewer than fifty employees or has average annual gross receipts of two million dollars or less. A business shall qualify even though it is a franchisee of a larger chain. (Ord. 2010-005 § 2, 2010: Ord. 98-004 § 8, 1998: Ord. 672 § 10, 1975)

3.16.110 Exceptions to bid policy.
The bidding procedures may be dispensed with in the following circumstances:

A.    Consultants. Contracts involving the acquisition of professional or specialized services, such as but not limited to services rendered by architects, attorneys, engineers, accountants and other classes where the city must depend upon the skill, integrity, judgment and ability of the service, are exempted from the formal and informal contracting requirements of this chapter. All such contracts shall be awarded by the city to the consultant whose proposal is evaluated to be the most responsive to the needs of the city, as determined by the city manager or, in the case of contracts exceeding fifty thousand dollars, the city council.

1.    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, contracts for architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, environmental, land surveying, and construction project management services, and any other profession set forth in Government Code Section 4525, shall be on the basis of demonstrated competence, and on the professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of services required.

2.    Where the department head for whom such services are to be performed and the city’s purchasing officer determine that the services needed are more of a technical nature and involve little professional judgement, they may determine that requiring bids pursuant to this chapter would be in the public interest.

B.    Specialized Services Combined With Equipment and/or Products. Contracts involving the acquisition and/or installation of equipment, intellectual property or other tangible products (collectively referred to as “products”) and the retention of specialized services, such as consulting, training, installing, maintaining or servicing the products, which are an integral or important part of the use, operation, or functionality of the products, are exempted from the formal and informal bidding requirements of this chapter.

C.    Sole Source Contracts.

1.    Sole source contracts shall be excepted from the formal and informal bidding requirements of this chapter. A sole source contract shall exist where the city’s requirements can be met only by a single patented article or process, or when there is only one feasible source that meets the city’s requirements.

2.    Except as provided for in Public Contract Code Section 3400, specifications for contracts for the construction, alteration or repair of public works shall not be drafted in such a manner as to limit the bidding, directly or indirectly, to any one specific concern, brand or trade name.

D.    Emergency. When an emergency requires the immediate procurement of supplies, equipment or services, such procurements are exempted from the formal and informal bid requirements of this chapter. For the purposes of this section, an emergency shall be deemed to exist only if:

1.    There is a great public disaster; or

2.    There is an immediate need to prepare for national or local defense; or

3.    There is a breakdown in machinery or an essential service which requires the immediate procurement of supplies and equipment to protect the public health, welfare or safety; or

4.    An essential departmental operation affecting the public health, welfare or safety would be greatly hampered if the prescribed purchase would cause an undue delay in the procurement of the needed item; or

5.    The city manager determines that an emergency purchase is necessary to ensure operational efficiency and/or fiscal responsibility for the city.

In such an emergency and notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the city manager is delegated the authority to make a purchase or enter into a contract in an amount up to and including one hundred thousand dollars which shall be reported to the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting. In the event of a declaration of emergency and activation of the emergency operations center pursuant to Chapter 2.36, those procedures shall apply and not be subject to the contracting authority limits in this chapter.

E.    Cooperative Purchasing. The city may join with other government agencies for the joint purchase of equipment, materials, supplies and services. The city may also buy directly from a vendor at a price established by competitive bidding by another public jurisdiction even if the city had not joined with that public agency in a cooperative purchase. The city may also purchase from the United States of America or any state, municipality or other public corporation or agency, or through a cooperative purchasing program established by the state or the United States, without calling for bids.

F.    Leases and Lease Purchases. The city may contract to lease or lease-purchase materials, vehicles and equipment without calling for bids.

G.    Used Items. The city may purchase used items without calling for bids. (Ord. 2018-003 § 2, 2018; Ord. 2017-001 § 4, 2017; Ord. 2010-005 § 4, 2010; Ord. 98-004 § 9, 1998: Ord. 672 § 11, 1975)

3.16.120 Surplus supplies and equipment.
A.    All using departments shall submit to the purchasing officer, at such times and in such form as he shall prescribe, reports showing all supplies and equipment which are no longer used or which have become obsolete or worn out. The purchasing officer shall have authority to exchange or trade in all such supplies, equipment and materials; to sell by public auction, sealed bid, or agreement with other public agencies; or sell by direct negotiated agreement, or on a consignment basis. In the event the purchasing officer determines that any such obsolete or surplus property has no salvage value, he may dispose of it as he deems advisable.

B.    The purchasing officer shall have the authority to sign bills of sale or any other papers or documents evidencing the transfer of the title of obsolete or surplus personal property for and on behalf of the city.

C.    Prior to disposing of any obsolete or surplus personal property having an apparent market value, the purchasing officer shall inform the council of the nature of the personal property proposed for disposition and the price offered, if known, and obtain the council’s approval for disposition.

3.17.010 Purpose and intent.
The city council finds that, in awarding contracts for the construction of public works projects, and for other city jobs and supplies, it is acting with public funds and is responsible to the residents of the city of San Pablo to spend such funds responsibly, it is the intent of the city council that contractors and consultants who have failed to comply with the terms of their contracts, or who have submitted false claims to the city or redevelopment agency, should not be considered responsible bidders for the purpose of awarding city contracts to the lowest responsible bidder. (Ord. 2000-003 § 1 (part), 2000)

3.17.020 Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the words set out in this section shall have the following meanings:

“Claim” includes any request or demand for money, property, or services made to any employee, officer or agent of the city or redevelopment agency, or to any person, grantee or other recipient, whether under contract or not, if any portion of the money, property or services requested or demanded issue from, or was provided by, the city or redevelopment agency.

“Knowing” and “knowingly” mean that a person, with respect to information, does any of the following:

1.    Has actual knowledge of the information;

2.    Acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information;

3.    Acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.

3.17.030 Contractor responsibilities.
Successful bidders for city jobs shall be required to comply with all terms of their contracts with the city or redevelopment agency, and shall not submit any invoices or requests for payment unless they have first reviewed such invoices and requests thoroughly, and are satisfied that such invoices or requests are authorized by the contract, are factually accurate, and are supported by adequate documentation. The failure to so review or to provide adequate documentation shall be considered to be reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information should the invoice or request, or the information contained therein, turn out to be false. (Ord. 2000-003 § 1 (part), 2000)

3.17.040 Right to audit.
The city shall have the right to audit the business records of any contractor whose invoices are not supported by adequate documentation.

Notwithstanding and not exclusive or preclusive of any pending or contemplated legal action, any division manager of the city responsible for the contracted work may bring charges to his or her department head against a person for violation of a contract or for submitting a false claim. The department head shall give written notice to the person of the charges and of all evidence supporting such charges. The department head shall then conduct a hearing where the charges and all evidence shall be presented. The person shall be entitled to offer rebuttal evidence in support of his or her position. Formal rules of evidence and procedure shall not apply. In the alternative, the department head may appoint a hearing officer to conduct such hearing and make a recommendation to be submitted to the department head. Following the hearing, at which evidence is required to be taken, the department head shall render a final written decision based solely on the evidence and testimony presented. The decision shall provide notification of rights to challenge the decision in court under Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6. (Ord. 2000-003 § 1 (part), 2000)

3.17.070 Period of debarment.
Any final written decision by the department head that includes a determination of non-responsibility or disqualification shall provide for a term of debarment. The maximum period for debarment shall be five years. During such debarment, the person shall not be permitted to act as a contractor or consultant for the city or development agency, and bids from such persons shall not be opened.

In addition, submittal of false claims may result in a determination of non-responsibility and disqualification from bidding on City or Redevelopment Agency projects for a five-year period. Chapter 3.17 is specifically incorporated by reference into this contract. (Ord. 2000-003 § 1 (part), 2000)

3.17.090 Retroactivity.
This chapter shall apply so that any person who has contracted with the city within two years prior to the effective date of this chapter may be debarred for false claims made during such prior contracts. (Ord. 2000-003 § 1 (part), 2000)

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the “uniform local sales and use tax ordinance.” (Ord. 649 § 1, 1973)

3.24.020 Purpose.
The city council declares that this ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other, purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

B.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

C.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;

D.    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 649 § 4, 1973)

3.24.030 Sales tax imposed.
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section 3.24.050 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in the city on and after January 1, 1974. (Ord. 649 § 6, 1973)

3.24.040 Use tax imposed.
An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the city of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after January 1, 1974, for storage, use or other consumption in the city at the rate stated in Section 3.24.050 of the sales price of the property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made. (Ord. 649 § 8, 1973)

3.24.050 Rate.
The rate of sales tax and use tax imposed by this chapter shall be .975 percent. (Ord. 649 § 2, 1973)

3.24.060 Place of sale.
For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 649 § 7, 1973)

3.24.070 Contract with state.
Prior to the operative date, January 1, 1974, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if the city has not contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance, which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

C.    To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes.

(Ord. 12-005 § 1 (part), 2012)

3.25.040 Contract with state.

3.26.080 Adoption of provisions of state law.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

A.    Wherever the state of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this city shall be substituted therefor. However, the substitution shall not be made when:

1.    The word “state” is used as a part of the title of the State Controller, State Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California;

2.    The result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against this city or any agency, officer, or employee thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.

3.    In those sections, including but not necessarily limited to sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the result of the substitution would be to:

a.    Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; or

b.    Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provision of that code.

3.26.120 Amendments.
All amendments subsequent to the effective date of this chapter to Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code relating to sales and use taxes and which are not inconsistent with Parts 1.6 and 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and all amendments to Parts 1.6 and 1.7 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, shall automatically become a part of this chapter; provided, however, that no such amendment shall operate so as to affect the rate of tax imposed by this chapter.

The city intends to negotiate an agreement with the fire protection district under which city will remit payment to the district on an agreed-upon basis in order to help fund the cost of providing a supplemental EMS squad at Station 70. Payments will be made on a regular basis on a frequency to be determined by city and county fire.

The city’s independent auditors shall complete a report reviewing the collection, management and expenditure of revenue from the tax levied by this chapter.

(Ord. 2014-007 § 1 (part), 2014)

3.28.005 Title.
The title of this chapter shall be “transient occupancy (hotel) tax.” (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.010 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter:

“Hotel” means any facility or structure, or any portion of any facility or structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients for purposes which include, but are not limited to, dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, timeshare project or facility, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof, and shall further include any space, lot, area, or site in any trailer court, campsite, park, or lot where a trailer, recreational vehicle, mobile home, motor home or similar conveyance, is occupied, or intended or designated for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes, except any private dwelling house or other individually owned single-family dwelling house unit rented only occasionally (infrequently) and incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his family; provided that the burden of establishing that the housing unit or facility is not a hotel as defined in this subsection shall be upon the owner or operator thereof, who shall file with the tax administrator such information as the tax administrator may reasonably require, to establish and maintain such status.

“Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right or entitlement to the use or possession, of any room, rooms or any portion thereof, in any hotel offered for rent to be used or occupied for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, regardless of the purpose for which the rooms are rented or provided.

“Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

“Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

“Qualifying rental agreement” means a written contract signed by both the landlord and tenant, legally enforceable by either party. The qualifying rental agreement shall provide for the right to occupy a specified number of rooms in a hotel for a period of not less than thirty-one consecutive days. “Qualifying rental agreement” expressly excludes:

1.    Any agreement, regardless of the rental term, which is terminated for any reason, by either party, or by mutual consent, prior to the thirty-first consecutive day of occupancy; or

2.    Any agreement which would be unlawful or constitute a violation of law.

“Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction there from whatsoever. “Rent” shall include: any energy surcharges or other surcharges imposed by the operator upon the transient; charges for use of a safe or other secure storage; charges for pets; charges for banquet rooms and meeting rooms.

“Successor to operator” means any person who acquires the right to operate a hotel from a predecessor operator, directly or indirectly, by whatever means, including purchase, foreclosure, operation of lease, or other means. A transfer of ownership or management interest in a hotel wherein the facility continues to operate as such, either continuously or for business interruption not exceeding thirty days, shall constitute a succession for purposes of this definition.

“Tax” means transient occupancy taxes due under this chapter.

“Tax administrator” means the finance director or his or her designated agent.

“Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days; provided, however, any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty consecutive calendar days has expired, unless there is a qualifying rental agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In the event of the existence of a qualifying rental agreement between the operator and any person for the occupancy of space of a hotel, which agreement permits such person to sublet such space to third persons either with or without the prior consent of the operator, then “transient” also means such person to whom such space is sublet for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.020 Registration.
A.    Prior to the commencement of business, every person engaging in or conducting business as an operator of a hotel renting to transients within the city shall file with the tax administrator an application for a transient occupancy registration permit (the “permit”) for each place of business. Every application for a permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator.

B.    At the time of making an application for a permit, the applicant shall pay a registration fee in an amount to be adopted by resolution of the city council.

C.    The permit shall, among other things, state the following:

1.    The name of the operator;

2.    The hotel address;

3.    The date upon which the permit was issued;

4.    The following statement: “This transient occupancy registration permit signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the transient occupancy tax chapter by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting such tax to the tax administrator. This permit does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business in any unlawful manner, nor operate a hotel without strictly complying with all applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This permit does not apply in lieu of such other permits which are otherwise required.” (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.030 Permit required—Posting of permit.
A.    No hotel subject to the provisions of this chapter shall operate without a valid transient occupancy tax permit.

B.    A valid transient occupancy tax permit shall be posted at all times in a conspicuous place on the premises. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.040 Current information.
During the effective duration of the transient occupancy registration permit, the operator shall promptly update, correct or supplement the information contained in his or her application on file with the city when necessary to keep the information contained therein current and accurate. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.050 Operator not relieved from other permit regulations.
Operators required to obtain a transient occupancy registration permit under this chapter shall not be relieved from obtaining any other permits for the privilege of carrying on any similar or related activity required under any other regulation of the city and shall remain subject to the regulatory provisions of all chapters of the municipal code. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.060 Tax imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to, and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient to the city, which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the city. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.070 Exemptions.
A.    No tax shall be imposed upon:

1.    The occupancy of a timeshare estate exempt from such tax as provided under Section 7280 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code;

2.    The occupancy by right of a membership camping contract exempt from such tax as provided under Section 7280 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code;

3.    The occupancy of facilities operated by a local governmental entity as provided under Section 7280 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code;

4.    The occupancy of any space in a campsite or campground located in the state park system as provided under section 7282 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code;

5.    The occupancy by a transient exempt from payment of transient occupancy tax by treaty or federal or state law;

6.    The occupancy by any federal or state of California officer or employee, including employees of federal credit unions, who provide sufficient proof that they are acting on official business; or

7.    The occupancy by any other person as to which it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided under this chapter.

B.    No exemption shall be granted under this section except upon a claim therefore made at the time the rent is collected, and under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.080 Operator duties and accounting requirements.
A.    Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient.

B.    If an operator collects the rent but fails to collect the tax imposed by this chapter for any reason, the operator shall be required to pay the tax.

C.    The amount of the tax charged to each transient shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. A duplicate of the receipt given to each transient shall be kept by the operator for a period of three years from the date of issuance.

D.    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator; or that it will not be added to the rent; or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter.

E.    Each operator shall account separately for, and maintain separate monthly summary totals for taxable and nontaxable rents and for taxes collected.

F.    Each operator shall maintain its financial and accounting records in accordance with established accounting practices acceptable to the tax administrator. Records of collection and remittance of the tax shall be maintained by the operator and made available to the tax administrator upon request for a period of three years. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.090 Reporting and remitting.
A.    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar month or such different reporting period as may be established by the tax administrator, file a return with the tax administrator, on forms provided by the tax administrator, of the total rents charged or chargeable under this chapter, the amount of tax collected for transient occupancy and such other information as the tax administrator shall reasonably require. Rent claimed on the return as exempt from the tax under Section 3.28.070 shall be fully itemized and explained on the return or supporting schedule.

B.    In determining the amount of “taxable receipts” on the tax return, “rent” as defined in Section 3.28.010, shall not be reduced by any business expenses including, but not limited to, the amount of service charges deducted by credit card companies or commissions paid to travel agencies.

C.    The return shall be filed whether or not rents have been charged or taxes have been collected during the month.

D.    Each such return shall contain a declaration under penalty of perjury, executed by the operator or his authorized agent, that to the best of the signator’s knowledge, the statements in the return are true, correct and complete.

E.    The same basis for accounting used by an operator for keeping books and records shall be used for reporting and remitting under this chapter.

F.    At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator.

G.    All taxes collected by an operator pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator.

H.    The tax administrator may establish either shorter or longer reporting periods if the tax administrator deems it necessary or desirable in order to insure collection of the tax or to increase the efficiency of administration.

I.    Returns and accrued tax payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason and subject to the requirements of Section 3.28.130.

J.    Returns and taxes not received by the tax administrator on or before the due date as provided in this section are delinquent and subject to the penalties imposed under Sections 3.28.140 and 3.28.150.

K.    Returns filed and taxes remitted by mail shall be deemed timely filed only if the envelope or similar container enclosing the returns and taxes is addressed to the tax administrator, has sufficient postage, and bears a United States postmark or a postage meter imprint prior to midnight on the last day for reporting and remitting without penalty. If the envelope or other container bears a postage meter imprint as well as a United States Post Office cancellation mark, the latter shall govern in determining whether the filing and remittance are timely. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.100 Extension for reporting and remitting.
The tax administrator, for good cause, may extend the deadline for the making of any return or paying of any amount required to be paid under this chapter, provided a request therefore is filed with the tax administrator. The extension may not exceed thirty days. Any operator to whom an extension is granted shall pay, in addition to the tax, interest at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax would have been due without the extension until the date of payment. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.110 Return not conclusive.
No return filed pursuant to this chapter shall be conclusive upon the city or upon any officer thereof as to the matters therein set forth, and the same shall not prejudice the right of the city to recover any tax that may be ascertained to be due from such operator in addition to the tax amount shown by such report should it be found to be incorrect. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.120 Accuracy of report subject to audit—Right to inspect records.
The accuracy of any report filed pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to audit and verification by the tax administrator who is authorized and empowered to inspect and audit the records and reports of any operator that pertain to the collection and remittance of the tax imposed by this chapter at all reasonable times at a location within the city and may request a subpoena from the city for the records of any operator who refuses to make such records available for examination. The mayor may issue such subpoenas and they shall be attested by the city clerk. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.130 Remitting and reporting requirements upon cessation of business.
A.    An operator who is transferring, selling or terminating operations of its hotel shall notify the tax administrator in writing of such sale, transfer or termination and, in the case of a sale or transfer, the name and address of the successor to operator. Notification of transfer, sale or termination of the hotel shall be provided at least thirty days in advance of the date of such transfer, sale or termination, unless the decision to sell, transfer or terminate was made within less than a thirty-day period prior to the transfer, sale or termination, in which case the operator shall then immediately notify the tax administrator.

B.    The operator shall, at the same time, notify the successor to operator of its responsibility for remitting unpaid collected taxes and further certify in writing to the tax administrator that the successor to operator was notified of the requirements of this chapter regarding its responsibility for unpaid collected taxes.

C.    An operator who is ceasing hotel operations shall make a return to the tax administrator at least ten days in advance of the cessation, unless the decision to cease hotel operations was made within less than a ten-day period in which case the operator shall then immediately make the return to the tax administrator. The return shall be made on approved forms available from the tax administrator and shall reflect the total taxable rents charged, the amount of tax collected for the reporting period, remittances made, if any, and the balance of the tax due at the time the return is filed. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the balance of the tax due, if any, shall be remitted to the tax administrator. After filing the final return and remitting the balance due, the operator shall make the hotel’s records of account available for a closeout audit by the tax administrator or duly authorized city employee. Returns filed and taxes remitted and actually received by the tax administrator on or before ten days prior to the cessation of business shall be deemed timely filed and remitted; otherwise, the taxes are delinquent and subject to the penalties imposed under Sections 3.28.140 and 3.28.150.

D.    An operator who is transferring or selling a hotel and who is liable for any tax and/or penalties under this chapter has a duty to report the amount of the tax and/or penalties to the successor to operator. The successor to operator shall then have a duty to withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase price to equal the amount of such tax and/or penalty until the operator produces a receipt from the tax administrator stating that the tax and/or penalty has been paid or a “tax clearance certificate” from the tax administrator stating that no tax or penalty is due. If the operator does not present a receipt or tax clearance certificate prior to the date such successor commences to conduct business, the successor to operator shall deposit the amount withheld with the tax administrator pending settlement of operator’s account.

E.    If the successor to operator fails to withhold a portion of the purchase price as required under this chapter, it shall be liable to the city for the payment of the amount required to be withheld. Within ten days of receiving a written request from a successor to operator for a tax clearance certificate stating that no tax or penalty is due, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the successor to operator at its address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the estimated amount of the tax and penalty that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.140 Penalty for delinquency.
Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required, including amounts determined due by the tax administrator under Section 3.28.160, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax. In addition, interest shall accrue on both the unpaid tax and penalty at the rate of one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax becomes delinquent until the date of remittance to the city. In the event the operator pays the tax, but fails to pay any interest or penalties, interest shall accrue upon the amount of the unpaid interest and penalty until the date of remittance to the city. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.150 False and fraudulent reports—Penalties for fraud.
A.    It is unlawful for any operator or person to willfully make, render, sign or verify any false or fraudulent report required by this chapter with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount required to be paid by this chapter.

B.    If the tax administrator determines that the failure to make any remittance or payment due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of one hundred percent of the amount of the tax and penalties shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in Section 3.28.140. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.160 Failure to collect or report tax: notice of assessment and/or jeopardy determination.
A.    If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax or to file any report or remit any taxes or any portion thereof as and when required under this chapter or if such operator fails to maintain complete and accurate records as required under Section 3.28.090, the tax administrator shall proceed to assess the applicable taxes and penalties provided for by this chapter against the operator as set forth in subsection B of this section.

B.    Upon an operator’s failure or refusal to make or file a timely complete and accurate return or remittance of tax due under this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such a manner as he or she shall deem necessary to obtain facts and information upon which to base an assessment of tax due. Upon such determination, the tax administrator shall proceed to assess the tax, penalties and interest due by the operator and shall deliver a written notice of assessment to the operator as provided in subsection E of this section.

C.    No determination of taxes, penalties and interest due by an operator under subsection B of this section shall be conclusive upon the city or prejudice the right of the city to collect additional amounts due. In the event the tax administrator determines taxes, penalties and interest assessed against an operator were less than those amounts actually owed, the tax administrator shall be entitled to collect the additional taxes, penalties and interest due by the operator upon written demand as provided in subsection E of this section. Penalties and interest shall accrue on such amounts as of the original delinquency date.

D.    Upon an operator’s violation of this chapter as provided in subsection A of this section and in addition to the notice of assessment as provided in subsection B of this section, to ensure the collection and remittance of taxes due the city, the tax administrator may require an operator to provide weekly or daily reports and tax remittance to the city pursuant to a written jeopardy determination as provided in subsection E of this section. The tax administrator shall cancel the requirements imposed under the jeopardy determination upon the operator’s compliance with all reporting requirements imposed by the tax administrator and remittance of all delinquent amounts due to the city under this chapter.

E.    The tax administrator shall deliver the notice of assessment or notice of a jeopardy determination to the operator or deposit the same in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator at the operator’s place of business identified in the transient occupancy registration permit. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.170 Administrative remedies and appeals.
A.    Any operator in receipt of a notice of assessment or jeopardy determination authorized pursuant to this chapter may appeal to a hearing officer by filing a notice of appeal with the city manager or his or her designee within fifteen days after service of a notice of assessment or jeopardy determination.

B.    All appeals filed pursuant to this section shall be conducted by a hearing officer pursuant to the procedures set forth at Chapter 8.02 of this code. In the case of a notice of assessment, if application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the amount determined due under the notice of assessment shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. In the case of a jeopardy determination, if application for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, no further consideration of the conditions imposed by the tax administrator shall be considered until the operator complies with all reporting requirements imposed by the tax administrator and remits all amounts due under this chapter. The hearing officer’s decision shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.180 Refunds.
A.    Whenever the amount of any tax or penalty has been overpaid, paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or erroneously received by the city under this chapter, the overpayment may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section, provided a claim in writing under penalty of perjury stating the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms available from the tax administrator.

B.    An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C.    A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the transient having paid the tax to the operator establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

D.    An operator who has remitted an amount in excess of the amount required to be paid by this chapter may receive a credit to the extent of the excess. If the excess is discovered as a result of an audit by the city, no claim need be filed by the operator. Such credit, if approved by the tax administrator shall be applied to any deficiency found or any further tax payments due under the rules prescribed by the tax administrator.

E.    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.190 Actions to collect taxes.
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city and payable through the operator. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of the chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city of San Pablo for the recovery of such amount. Upon the concurrence of the city manager, the tax administrator is authorized to compromise the collection of the amount or establish a schedule of payment for any tax due, or to discontinue the collection of any claim if it appears that further proceedings would be without merit. (Ord. 04-014 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.28.200 Divulging of information prohibited.

No person having an administrative duty under this chapter shall make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an investigation of the records of any operator or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any return, or to knowingly permit any return or copy thereof or any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person, except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States, the state of California, the county of Contra Costa or the city of San Pablo for official use only.

3.40.020 Telephone users tax.
A.    There is imposed a tax upon every person in the city using telephone communication services, including interstate, intrastate, and/or international telephone communication services. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of seven percent of all charges made for such services and shall be paid by the person paying for such services. Interstate calls shall be deemed to include calls to the District of Columbia. There is a rebuttable presumption that telephone communication services, which are billed to a billing or service address in the city, are used, in whole or in part, within the city’s boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this chapter. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax, regardless of where the telephone communication service may originate, terminate, or pass through. Charges for mobile telephone communications services are subject to taxation under this article if the customer’s place of primary use is in the city, regardless of where the mobile telephone communications service may originate, terminate, or pass through.

B.    As used in this section, the term “charges” shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the telephone communication services. Charges shall not include:

Charges for any type of service or equipment furnished by a service supplier subject to public utility regulation during any period in which the same or similar services or equipment are also available for sale or lease from persons other than a service supplier subject to public utility regulation.

C.    Exemptions. The tax imposed under this chapter shall not be imposed on any of the following:

1.    Certain Coin-Operated Service. Service paid for by inserting coins in coin-operated telephones available to the public with respect to local telephone service, or with respect to toll telephone service if the charge for such toll telephone service is less than twenty-five cents; except that where such coin-operated telephone service is furnished for a guaranteed amount, the amounts paid under such guarantee plus any fixed monthly or other periodic charge shall be subject to the tax.

2.    News Services. No tax shall be imposed, except with respect to local telephone service, on any payment received from any person for services used in the collection of news for the public press, or a news ticker service furnishing a general news service similar to that of the public press, or radio broadcasting, or in the dissemination of news through the public press, or a news ticker service furnishing a general news service similar to that of the public press, or by means of radio broadcasting, if the charge for such service is billed in writing to such person.

3.    International Organizations or Red Cross. No tax shall be imposed on any payment received for services furnished to an international organization, or to the American National Red Cross.

4.    Servicemen in Combat Zone. No tax shall be imposed on any payment received for any toll telephone service which originates within a combat zone from a member of the Armed Forces of the United States performing service in such combat zone, as determined under such section, provided a certificate, setting forth such facts as the secretary may by regulations prescribe, is furnished to the person receiving such payment.

5.    Items Otherwise Taxed. Only one payment of tax under this section shall be required with respect to the tax on any service, notwithstanding the lines or stations of one or more persons are used in furnishing such service.

6.    Common Carriers and Communications Companies. No tax shall be imposed on the amount paid for any toll telephone service to the extent that the amount so paid is for use by a common carrier, telephone or telegraph company, or radio broadcasting station or network in the conduct of its business as such.

7.    Installation Charges. No tax shall be imposed on so much of any amount paid for the installation of any instrument, wire, pole, switchboard, apparatus, or equipment as is properly attributable to such installation.

8.    Nonprofit Hospitals. No tax shall be imposed on any amount paid by a nonprofit hospital for services furnished to such organization. For purposes of this subsection, the term “nonprofit hospital” means a hospital which is exempt from income tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a).

9.    State and Local Governmental Exemption. No tax shall be imposed on any payment received for services or facilities furnished to the government of any state, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia.

10.    Exemption for Nonprofit Educational Organizations. No tax shall be imposed on any amount paid by a nonprofit educational organization for services or facilities furnished to such organization. For purposes of this subsection, the term “nonprofit educational organization” means an educational organization which is exempt from income tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). The term also includes a school operated as an activity of an organization which is exempt from income tax under Section 501(a), if the school normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.

11.    Life-Line Service. No tax shall be imposed on service users subscribing to the life-line service as set by the California Public Utilities Commission.

13.    Other Service or Equipment. Any type of service or equipment furnished by a service supplier subject to public utility regulation during any period in which the same or similar services or equipment are also available for sale or lease from persons other than a service supplier subject to public utility regulation.

14.    Private Mobile Radio Service. For purposes of this chapter, “private mobile radio service” is a radio communication service which is not a commercial mobile service. A “mobile service” means a radio communication service carried on between mobile stations or receivers and land stations, and by mobile stations communicating among themselves, and includes: A) both one-way and two-way radio communication services, B) a mobile service which provides a regularly interacting group of base, mobile, portable, and associated control and relay stations (whether licensed on an individual, cooperative, or multiple basis) for private one-way or two-way land mobile radio communications by eligible users over designated areas of operation, and C) any service for which a license is required in a personal communications service established pursuant to the proceeding entitled “Amendment to the Commission’s Rules to Establish New Personal Communications Services” (GEN Docket No. 90-314; ET Docket No. 92-100), or any successor proceeding. A “commercial mobile service” is a “mobile service” that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available to the public to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public.

D.    The tax administrator, from time to time, may issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this chapter, an administrative ruling identifying those telecommunication services that are subject to the tax of subsection A of this section. An administrative ruling shall implement the intent of the city council that the telephone users’ tax be imposed on any person who initiates or receives high-quality voice communications without regard to the type or kind of transmission media or technology that exists on the date the amendments to this section become effective or which may be developed in the future. An administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax or increase an existing tax without voter approval.

E.    To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of telephone communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the tax administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or city on such telephone communication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the city under this section. For purposes of establishing sufficient legal nexus for the imposition and collection of utility users’ tax on charges for telephone communication services pursuant to this chapter, “minimum contacts” shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition and collection of the utility users’ tax at the fullest extent permitted by California and federal law, and as it may change from time to time.

F.    The tax on telephone communication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the tax administrator, and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the twenty-fifth day of the following month. (Ord. 06-013 § 2, 2006: Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.030 Electricity users tax.

6.    Charges, fees, or surcharges for electricity services or programs which are mandated by the California Public Utilities Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whether or not such charges, fees, or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing.

C.    The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the electric service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of electric retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefore, including those items that are mandated by state or federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such electric service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such electric service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: (1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric service; or (2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers.

The credit, if approved by the tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent remittance that becomes due. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

2.    Gas transportation charges (including interstate charges to the extent not included in commodity charges);

3.    Storage charges; provided, however, that the service supplier shall not be required to apply the tax to any charges for gas storage services when the service supplier cannot, as a practical matter, determine the jurisdiction where such stored gas is ultimately used; but it shall be the obligation of the service user to self-collect the amount of tax not applied to any charge for gas storage by the service supplier and to remit the tax to the appropriate jurisdiction;

4.    Capacity or demand charges, late charges, service establishment or reestablishment charges, transition charges, customer charges, minimum charges, annual and monthly charges, and any other charges which are necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; and

The tax on gas provided by self-production or by a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in Section 3.40.050 of this chapter. All other taxes on charges for gas imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the gas service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the tax administrator, and must be received by the tax administrator, on or before the twenty-fifth day of the following month; or, at the option of the person required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user, which must be received by the tax administrator on or before the twenty-fifth day of the following month, provided that such person shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent remittance that becomes due. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.050 Collection of tax from service users receiving direct purchase of gas or electricity.
A.    Any service user subject to the tax imposed by Section 3.40.030 or 3.40.040 of this chapter, which produces gas or electricity for self-use; which receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services, directly from a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this chapter; or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax collected and remitted by its service supplier, a non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent on the use of gas or electricity in the city, including any related supplemental services, shall report such fact to the tax administrator and shall remit the tax due directly to the tax administrator within thirty days of such use. In lieu of paying such actual tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the tax administrator within thirty days of such use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month, or upon the payment pattern of similar customers of the service supplier using similar amounts of gas or electricity, provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due.

B.    The tax administrator may require the service user to identify its non-utility service supplier and provide, subject to audit: invoices; books of account; or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, and the cost or price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such satisfactory evidence, or if the administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion of the tax administrator is excessive, the tax administrator may determine the tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, had been provided by the service supplier that is the primary supplier of gas or electricity within the city. Rate schedules for this purpose shall be available from the city. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.090 Exemptions.
A.    Constitutionality. Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing a tax upon: (1) any person or service when imposition of such tax upon that person or service would be in violation of a federal or state statute, the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California; and, (2) the City or Redevelopment Agency of the city of San Pablo.

B.    Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this section shall file an application with the tax administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name, or is a service user of telephone communication services that has received a federal excise tax exemption certificate for such service. Such application shall be made upon a form approved by the tax administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all utility service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the tax administrator, such service user shall give the tax administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service suppliers so that the tax administrator can properly notify the new utility service supplier of the service user’s tax exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users’ taxes collected and remitted to the tax administrator from such service user as a result of such non-compliance. Upon request of the tax administrator, a service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, shall provide a list of the names and addresses of those customers which, according to its billing records, are deemed exempt from the utility users’ tax. With respect to a service user of telephone communication services, a service supplier of such telephone communication services doing business in the city shall, upon request of the tax administrator, provide a copy of the federal exemption certificate for each exempt customer within the city that is served by such service supplier.

For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this chapter, “substantial nexus” and “minimum contacts” shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.110 Duty to collect and remit—Procedures.
The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be performed as follows:

A.    The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on such charges, Section 3.40.130 shall apply.

B.    The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.120 Filing return and payment.
Each person required by this chapter to remit a tax shall file a return with the tax administrator, on forms approved by the tax administrator on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax owed shall be included with the return and filed with the tax administrator. The tax administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the tax administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.130 Collection penalties—Service suppliers or self-collectors.
A.    Taxes collected from a service user, or self-collected by a service user subject to Section 3.40.050 of this chapter, are delinquent if not received by the tax administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the tax administrator on or before the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the city’s account on or before the following business day.

B.    If a service supplier, or a service user subject to Section 3.40.050 of this chapter, fails to remit any tax collected, on or before the due date, the person shall pay a penalty for such delinquencies at the rate of fifteen percent of the total tax that is delinquent in the remittance, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid.

C.    The tax administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and/or remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of fifteen percent of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the tax administrator.

D.    For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.140 Actions to collect.
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the tax administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person’s noncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.150 Deficiency determination and assessment—Tax application errors.
A.    The tax administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person required to collect or self-collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter has failed to collect and remit the proper amount of tax by improperly applying or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges.

B.    The tax administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within fourteen calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the matter. If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the city.

C.    If the person requests a hearing, the tax administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing not later than fourteen days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the tax administrator to such person at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the tax administrator desires such person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced.

D.    At the time fixed for the hearing, the tax administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the tax administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the tax administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person owing the tax. The decision of the tax administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 3.40.200 of this chapter. Filing an application with the tax administrator and appeal to the city administrator pursuant to Section 3.40.200 of this chapter is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

E.    Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the tax administrator on or before the thirtieth day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen percent on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the city seeking payment of a tax assessed under this section shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection.

F.    All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.160 Administrative remedy—Nonpaying service users.
A.    Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the tax administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specific billing periods. The service supplier shall provide the city with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this chapter.

B.    In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen percent of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.

C.    The tax administrator shall notify the non-paying service user that the tax administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.

D.    If the service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator within thirty days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the tax administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent of the amount of the total tax that is owed. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.170 Additional powers and duties of the tax administrator.
A.    The tax administrator shall have the power and duty, and is directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.

B.    The tax administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations not inconsistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the tax administrator’s office.

C.    Upon a proper showing of good cause, the tax administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby: (1) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier (or service user subject to Section 3.40.050 of this chapter) so long as such agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or (2) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the tax administrator’s office, and are voidable by the tax administrator or the city manager at any time.

D.    The tax administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The tax administrator shall notify such person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review shall not exceed a period of three years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by such person from the tax administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the tax administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to Section 3.40.150 of this chapter for all taxes, penalties and interest owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the tax administrator. If the person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the tax administrator to verify compliance with this chapter, the tax administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency. The reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of correctness.

E.    Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the tax administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed forty-five days, provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during such extension at the rate of three-quarters of one percent per month, prorated for any portion thereof.

F.    The tax administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this chapter.

G.    The tax administrator, with the written approval of the city attorney and city manager, may compromise a claim pursuant to this chapter where the portion of the claim proposed to be released is less than one thousand dollars; and, with the approval of the city attorney and the city council, may compromise such a claim where the portion proposed to be released is equal to or greater than one thousand dollars.

H.    Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the tax administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this chapter if the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-collection was in good faith, the tax administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or other precedence. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.180 Records.
A.    It is the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax that such person may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to the tax administrator, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

B.    The city may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the tax administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the tax administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the tax administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the city on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the city for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to conduct the inspection.

C.    The tax administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure agreement approved by the city attorney to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7. The tax administrator may request from a person providing transportation or distribution services of gas or electricity to service users within the city, a list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities of gas or electricity delivered, and other pertinent information, of its transportation customers within the city pursuant to Section 6354(e) of the California Public Utilities Code.

D.    If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: (1) provide to the tax administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and, (2) upon request of the tax administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the tax administrator, is necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the city.

E.    If any person subject to record-keeping under this section unreasonably denies the tax administrator, or the tax administrator’s designated representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, the tax administrator may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars on such person for each day following: (1) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or (2) the due date for production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this chapter. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.190 Refunds.
A.    Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in this section.

B.    The tax administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator under this chapter, provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor or administrator has submitted a written claim, under penalty of perjury, to the tax administrator within one year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of such tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant’s right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. Nothing in this section shall permit the filing of a refund claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers. Where the amount of any individual refund claim is in excess of one thousand dollars, city council approval shall be required.

C.    It is the intent of the city that the one-year written claim requirement of this section be given retroactive effect; provided, however, that any claims which arose prior to the enactment of the one-year claims period of this section, and which are not otherwise barred by a then-applicable statute of limitations or claims procedure, must be filed with the tax administrator as provided in this subsection within ninety days following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

D.    The tax administrator, or the city council where the claim is in excess of one thousand dollars, shall act upon the refund claim within forty-five days of the initial receipt of the refund claim. Such decision shall be final. If the tax administrator/city council fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the forty-five-day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the tax administrator/city council on the forty-fifth day. The tax administrator shall give notice of the action in a form which substantially complies with that set forth in Government Code Section 913.

E.    The filing of a written claim is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action brought against the city pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Government Code Sections 945.6 and 946.

F.    Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission, makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this chapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall also be refunded to service users, and the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly return. In the event this chapter is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes shall be borne by the city.

G.    Notwithstanding subsections B and C of this section, a service supplier shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit against an underpayment whenever such overpayment has been received by the city within the three years next preceding a deficiency determination or assessment by the tax administrator, or during any year for which the service supplier, at the request of the tax administrator, has executed a waiver of the defense of the statute of limitations with regard to any claim the city may have for a utility users tax. A service supplier shall not be entitled to such credit unless it clearly establishes the right to the credit by written records showing entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances shall an overpayment taken as a credit against an underpayment pursuant to this subsection qualify a service supplier for a refund to which it would not otherwise be entitled under the one-year written claim requirement of this section. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.200 Appeals.
A.    Any person aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision relating to a refund pursuant to Section 3.40.190 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the tax administrator, shall be required to comply with the appeals procedure of this section. Compliance with this section shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon. Nothing in this section shall permit the filing of a claim or action on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers, and such class claims are prohibited.

B.    If any person is aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision relating to a refund pursuant to Section 3.40.190 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the tax administrator, he or she may appeal to the city manager by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fourteen days of the date of the decision, deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the tax administrator which aggrieved the service user or service supplier.

C.    The matter shall be set for hearing no more than thirty days from the receipt of the appeal. The appellant shall be served with notice of the time and place of the hearing, as well as any relevant materials, at least five calendar days prior to the hearing. The hearing may be continued from time to time upon mutual consent. At the time of the hearing, the appealing party, the tax administrator, and any other interested person may present such relevant evidence as he or she may have relating to the determination from which the appeal is taken.

D.    Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the city’s files, the city manager shall issue a written notice and order upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is taken. The notice shall be given within fourteen days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall specify that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be filed within ninety days from the date of the decision in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. If the city manager fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the fourteen-day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the city manager on the fourteenth day.

(Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.230 Remedies cumulative.
All remedies and penalties prescribed by this chapter or which are available under any other provision of law or equity, including but not limited to the California False Claims Act (Government Code Section 12650 et seq.) and the California Unfair Practices Act (Business and Professions Code Section 17070 et seq.), are cumulative. The use of one or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.240 Notice of changes to ordinance.
If a tax under this chapter is added, repealed, increased, reduced, or the tax base is changed, the tax administrator shall follow the notice requirements of Public Utilities Code Section 799. Prior to the effective date of the ordinance change, the service supplier shall provide the tax administrator with a copy of any written procedures describing the information that the service supplier needs to implement the ordinance change. If the service supplier fails to provide such written instructions, the tax administrator, or his or her agent, shall send, by first class mail, a copy of the ordinance change to all collectors and remitters of the city’s utility user’s taxes according to the latest payment records of the tax administrator. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.245 Temporary reduction in tax rate.
The city council may, by resolution, reduce, suspend, or direct a credit back to the public of, all or a portion of the tax for such periods as it may determine.

(Ord. 06-006 § 1, 2006)

3.40.250 Future amendment to cited statute.
Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a state or federal statute in this chapter means such statute as it may be amended from time to time. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.260 Changes without voter approval.
The city council is authorized to make any amendments to the ordinance codified in this chapter, as adopted by the voters, without a vote of the people; provided however, that it shall not increase any of the utility user’s taxes specified in this chapter without complying with all relevant constitutional and statutory provisions. (Ord. 04-013 § 1 (part), 2004)

3.40.270 Severability.
The city council and the people of the city of San Pablo, California declare that if any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. The council and people declare that they would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase not declared invalid or unconstitutional, irrespective of the fact that any one or more section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase would be subsequently declared invalid or unconstitutional.

Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show such information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant, an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the collector shall have the power to base the license tax based on the number of employees or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter.

5.04.080 Exemptions.

The provisions of this-chapter shall not require the payment of a license tax to conduct, manage or carry on any business, occupation or activity from any institution or organization which is conducted, managed or carried on wholly for the benefit of charitable purposes and from which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly, by any individual.

B.    Nonprofit Activities.

6.    Any further information which the collector may require to enable him to issue the type of license applied for.

B.    If the amount of the license tax to be paid by the applicant is measured by the number of employees, he shall estimate the number of employees for the period to be covered by the license to be issued. Such estimate, if accepted by the collector as reasonable, shall be used in determining the amount of license tax to be paid by the applicant.

C.    The collector shall not issue to any such person another license for the same or any other business, until such person has furnished to him the sworn statement and paid the license tax as required in this chapter. (Ord. 611 § 10, 1970)

5.06.020 Requirement for tobacco retailer license.
A.    It is unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter, as well as a use permit pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.62.180 of this code, for each location at which that activity is to occur. No license may be issued to authorize tobacco retailing at other than a fixed location. For example, tobacco retailing by persons on foot and tobacco retailing from vehicles is prohibited.

B.    The tobacco retailer’s license shall be paid at the same time as a business license is obtained or renewed pursuant to Chapter 5.04 of this code. The payment of the license fee designated in Section 5.06.060 confers paid status upon a license for the same term as the business license is valid. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer’s license no later than thirty days prior to expiration of the business license.

C.    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right other than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of any other provision of applicable law, including, without limitation, any condition or limitation on smoking in enclosed places of employment made applicable to business establishments by California Labor Code Section 6404.5.

D.    Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products Prohibited. No tobacco retailer shall sell any flavored tobacco product.

E.    Minimum Pack Size. The following shall be the minimum pack size for the sale of cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars:

1.    Cigars—a minimum pack of six;

2.    Cigarillos—a minimum pack of twenty-five; and

3.    Little cigars—a minimum pack of twenty.

F.    Minimum cost per cigar: ten dollars. (Ord. 18-006 § 4, 2018; Ord. 10-003 § 1, 2010; Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.030 Application procedure.
Application for a tobacco retailer’s license shall be submitted, at the same time as an initial or renewed business license application, in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof. It is the responsibility of each proprietor to be informed of the laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer’s license. A license that is issued in error or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor may be revoked pursuant to Section 5.06.090(C) of this chapter. All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the department and shall contain the following information:

A.    The name, address and telephone number of each proprietor;

B.    The business name, address, and telephone number of the single fixed location for which a tobacco retailer’s license is sought;

C.    The name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to receive all license-related communications and notices (the “authorized address”). If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified in subsection B of this section;

D.    Whether or not any proprietor has previously been issued a license pursuant to this chapter that is, or was at any time, suspended or revoked and, if so, the dates of the suspension period or the date of revocation;

E.    Such other information as the department deems necessary for the administration or enforcement of this chapter. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.040 Issuance of license.
Upon the receipt of an application for a tobacco retailer’s license and the license fee, the department shall issue a license unless substantial record evidence demonstrates one of the following bases for denial:

A.    The application is incomplete or inaccurate;

B.    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing by a proprietor for which a suspension is in effect pursuant to Section 5.06.080 of this chapter; or by a proprietor which has had a license revoked pursuant to Section 5.06.090(A)(4) of this chapter; or

C.    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to Section 5.06.020 of this chapter (e.g., mobile vending), that is unlawful pursuant to this code, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other local, state or federal law. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.050 Display of license.
Each license shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the licensed premises. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.060 Fees for license.
The fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer’s license shall be established by resolution of the city council. The fee shall be calculated so as to recover no more than the total cost of license administration and enforcement, including, for example, but not limited to, issuing the license, administering the license program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violations, and prosecution of violators. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.070 Licenses nontransferable.
A tobacco retailer’s license is nontransferable. If the information required in the license application pursuant to Section 5.06.030, subsections A, B or C, changes, a new tobacco retailer’s license is required before the business may continue to act as a tobacco retailer. For example, if a proprietor to whom a license has been issued changes business location, that proprietor must apply for a new license prior to acting as a tobacco retailer at the new location. Or if the business is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that location before acting as a tobacco retailer. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.080 License violation.
A.    Violation of Tobacco-Related Laws. It is a violation of a tobacco retailer’s license for a licensee or his or her agent or employee to violate any local, state, or federal tobacco-related law.

B.    License Compliance Monitoring. Compliance with this chapter shall be monitored by the code enforcement division. Any peace officer may also enforce this chapter. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.090 Suspension or revocation of license.
A.    Suspension or Revocation of License for Violation. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer’s license shall be suspended or revoked if the department finds, after notice to the licensee and opportunity to be heard, that the licensee or his or her agents or employees has or have violated the requirements of this chapter or other conditions of the license imposed pursuant to Section 5.06.080 of this chapter. The department director shall appoint a hearing officer to conduct hearings under this section. Notice shall be provided and the hearing conducted in substantially the form and manner set forth in Sections 8.02.070 through 8.02.140 of this code.

1.    Upon a finding by the department of a first license violation within any sixty-month period, the license shall be suspended for up to thirty days, depending on the willfulness of the violations and the need to deter further violations. At the election of the tobacco retailer, the tobacco retailer may pay a penalty of one thousand dollars in lieu of such suspension. The payment of a penalty in lieu of suspension does not expunge the violation and the violation will be counted for the purposes of a future finding that a second or subsequent violation has occurred.

2.    Upon a finding by the department of a second license violation within any sixty-month period, the license shall be suspended for ninety days, depending on the willfulness of the violations and the need to deter further violations.

3.    Upon a finding by the department of a third license violation within any sixty-month period, the license shall be suspended for one year, depending on the willfulness of the violations and the need to deter further violations.

4.    Upon a finding by the department of a fourth license violation within any sixty-month period, the license shall be revoked and the proprietor or proprietors who had been issued the license shall never again be issued a tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter.

B.    Suspension of License for Failure to Pay Renewal Fee. A tobacco retailer’s license that is not timely renewed pursuant to Section 5.06.020(B) shall automatically be suspended by operation of law. If not renewed, a license shall be automatically revoked two years after the renewal date.

C.    Revocation of License Issued in Error. A tobacco retailer’s license shall be revoked if the department finds, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a license under Section 5.06.040 existed at the time application was made or at anytime before the license issued. The revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new application for a license.

D.    Appeal of Suspension or Revocation. A decision of the department to revoke or suspend a license is appealable to the city manager and must be filed with the city manager within ten days of mailing of the department’s decision. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the appealed action. A suspension or revocation pursuant to subsection B of this section is not subject to appeal. Except as set forth in this chapter, and insofar as applicable, the provisions of Sections 8.02.130 and 8.02.140 shall govern such appeals. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.100 Administrative fine.
A.    Grounds for Fine. If the department finds, based on substantial evidence, that any unlicensed person, including a person named on a revoked or suspended license, has engaged in tobacco retailing in violation of Section 5.06.020 of this chapter, the department may fine that person as follows:

1.    A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for a first violation in any twelve-month period;

2.    A fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for a second violation in any twelve-month period; or

3.    A fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for a third or subsequent violation in any twelve-month period.

Each day that such a person engages in tobacco retailing shall constitute a separate violation.

B.    Notice of Violation. A notice of violation and of intent to impose a fine shall be personally served on, or sent by certified mail to, the person or persons subject to the fine. The notice shall state the basis of the department’s determinations and include an advisement of the right to request a hearing to contest the fine. Any request for a hearing must be in writing and must be received by the department within ten calendar days of personal service of the notice on the person or persons subject to a fine or within fifteen calendar days if the person or persons subject to a fine are served by mail.

C.    Imposition of Fine. If no request for a hearing is timely received, the department’s determination on the violation and the imposition of a fine shall be final and payment shall be made within thirty calendar days of written demand made in the manner specified in this section for a notice of violation. If the fine is not paid within that time, the fine may be collected, along with interest at the legal rate, in any manner provided by law. In the event that a judicial action is necessary to compel payment of the fine and accumulated interest, the person or persons subject to the fine shall also be liable for the costs of the suit and attorney’s fees incurred by the city in collecting the fine.

D.    Notice of Hearing. If a hearing is requested pursuant to subsection B of this section, the department shall provide written notice, within forty-five calendar days of its receipt of the hearing request, to the person or persons subject to a fine of the date, time, and place of the hearing in the manner specified in subsection B for a notice of violation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1094.5 or Section 1094.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, within twenty days after personal service of the hearing officer’s decision and findings, or within twenty-five days if served by mail, any person subject to a fine may seek review of the hearing officer’s decision and findings by the superior court of limited jurisdiction. A copy of the notice of appeal to the superior court shall be timely served in person or by first-class mail upon the department by the contestant. The appeal shall be heard de novo, except that the contents of the department’s file in the case shall be received in evidence. A copy of the records of the department of the notices of the violation and of the hearing officer’s decision and findings shall be admitted into evidence as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

H.    Failure to Pay Fine. If no timely notice of appeal to the superior court is filed, or the department is not timely served with a copy of a notice of appeal, the hearing officer’s decision and findings shall be deemed confirmed and the fine shall be collected pursuant to subsection C of this section. (Ord. 04-007 § 2 (part), 2004)

5.06.110 Enforcement.
The remedies provided by this chapter are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.

A.    Causing, permitting, aiding, abetting, or concealing a violation of any provision of this ordinance shall constitute a violation.

5.10.010 Purpose.
The city of San Pablo as a whole is considered “oversaturated” with off-sale and on-sale liquor licenses. Alcoholic beverage sales uses have a documented history, in this and other cities, of directly contributing to numerous peace, health, safety and welfare problems in their neighborhoods, including loitering, littering, drug trafficking, prostitution, public drunkenness, defacement and damaging of structures, pedestrian obstructions and harassment of passersby, public urination, police detentions and arrests, as well as traffic circulation, parking and noise problems on public streets and neighborhood lots. The existence of such problems creates serious impacts on the health, safety and welfare of the residents of nearby single and multiple-family areas, including fear for the safety of their children and of visitors, as well as contributing to the deterioration of their neighborhoods, devaluation of their property, and destruction of their community values and quality of life. The police department and code enforcement division continue to confront various public nuisance conditions at and around existing establishments. In view of limited staffing and resources, judicial actions against all individual establishments is deemed not feasible as a preferred method of controlling these problems on a city-wide basis. This chapter provides a set of additional tools to reduce the costly and harmful effects of irresponsible alcohol sales and consumption on local businesses, residents, law enforcement, medical care, educational, preventive, treatment and rehabilitation resources.

This chapter confers deemed approved status upon certain existing alcoholic beverage sales establishments that were nonconforming uses before the adoption of these regulations. The purpose of this chapter is to control and abate nuisance and criminal activities by requiring that they comply with the deemed approved performance standards as specified in Section 5.10.060 and to achieve the following objectives:

A.    To protect adjacent neighborhoods from the harmful effects attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages.

B.    To provide opportunities for businesses that sell alcoholic beverages to operate in a mutually beneficial relationship to each other and to other commercial and civic services.

C.    To provide mechanisms to address problems often associated with the public consumption of alcoholic beverages, such as litter, loitering, graffiti, unruly behavior and escalated noise levels.

D.    To ensure that businesses which sell alcoholic beverages are not the source of undue public nuisances in the community.

E.    To ensure that sites where alcoholic beverages are sold are properly maintained so that negative impacts generated by these activities are not harmful to the surrounding environment in any way.

F.    To monitor deemed approved uses to ensure that they do not substantially change their mode or character of operation. (Ord. 06-003 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.10.020 Exemptions.
The following uses are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

A.    Full-service restaurants as defined in Section 17.62.020(C).

B.    Establishments with twenty-five or more full time equivalent (FTE) employees and a total gross floor area of twenty thousand square feet or more. (Ord. 06-003 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.10.030 Automatic deemed approved status.
All alcoholic beverage sales establishments as defined in Section 17.70.040 existing and operating with all required permits on the effective date of this chapter, that were nonconforming uses immediately prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, may continue to exercise the same rights and privileges without requiring a use permit, except as provided in Section 5.10.040. Such use is a nonconforming use, subject to the nonconforming use provisions of Chapter 17.08 (except as otherwise provided in this chapter or in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of the State Business and Professions Code) and is entitled to deemed approved status. Such uses shall automatically become deemed approved uses on the effective date of this chapter. Each such deemed approved use shall retain this status as long as it complies with the deemed approved performance standards as specified in Section 5.10.060, and so long as the licensed premises are in continuous operation without any substantial change in the mode or character of the operation of the premises. None of the provisions of this chapter restricts any authority to require modification or termination of any deemed approved use which does not conform to the provisions of Section 5.10.060 or which has been declared a nuisance by the city. (Ord. 06-003 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.10.040 Change in mode or character of operation.
A.    Upon request of the police department or code enforcement division, the planning director shall agendize a public hearing before the planning commission to determine whether a use permit is required for an existing alcoholic beverage sales establishment if any of the following occurs:

1.    The deemed approved use discontinues active operation for a continuous period of more than thirty days;

2.    The deemed approved use surrenders, abandons, closes, or quits its licensed premises;

3.    The deemed approved uses’ license from the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is suspended or surrendered for thirty days or more;

4.    The deemed approved use changes its activity so that the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control requires a different type of license;

5.    The deemed approved use expands its floor area devoted to the display or sales of alcoholic beverages, or both, by more than twenty percent;

6.    Any other circumstances that result in a substantial change in the mode or character of operation, except for those circumstances listed in subdivision (b) of Section 23790 of the California Business and Professions Code.

B.    Following the public hearing, the planning commission shall determine whether a substantial change in the mode or character of operation of the premises has occurred. If the commission determines that a substantial change has occurred, the alcoholic beverage sales establishment must cease operation and may not resume unless it applies for and obtains a use permit in conformance with this chapter.

C.    The public hearing shall be noticed in accordance with Section 5.10.080. In any hearing under this chapter, the enforcement officer(s) shall be considered the prosecutor, and the planning division shall act on behalf of the planning commission or city council to present the issues for decision.

D.    The decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council in accordance with Section 5.10.140. (Ord. 06-003 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.10.050 Notification to owners of deemed approved status.
The police department shall notify the owner of each deemed approved use, and also the property owner if not the same, of the use’s deemed approved status. Such notice shall be sent via certified return receipt mail and shall include:

A.    A copy of the performance standards as specified in Section 5.10.060, with the requirement that these be posted in a conspicuous and unobstructed place visible from the entrance of the establishment for public review.

B.    Notification that the use is required to comply with all these performance standards.

C.    Notification that a review fee is required. The amount of such fee shall be as established or amended by the city council.

D.    Notification that the use is required to comply with all other aspects of the deemed approved regulations.

Should the notice be returned, it shall be sent via regular U.S. mail. Failure of any person to receive notice given pursuant to this section shall not affect the deemed approved status of the use. (Ord. 06-003 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.10.060 Deemed approved uses—Performance standards.
An activity shall retain its deemed approved status only if it conforms with all of the following deemed approved performance standards:

A.    It does not result in adverse effects to the health, peace or safety of persons residing or working in the surrounding area.

B.    It does not result in jeopardizing or endangering the public health or safety of persons residing or working in the surrounding area.

C.    It does not contribute to repeated nuisance activities within the premises or in close proximity of the premises, including but not limited to disturbance of the peace, illegal drug activity, public drunkenness, drinking in public, harassment of passersby, gambling, prostitution, sale of stolen goods, public urination, theft, assaults, batteries, acts of vandalism, excessive littering, loitering, graffiti, illegal parking, excessive loud noises, especially in the late night or early morning hours, traffic violations, curfew violations, lewd conduct, or police detentions and arrests.

D.    It does not result in violations to any applicable provision of any other city, county, state, or federal regulation, ordinance, or statute.

E.    Its upkeep and operating characteristics are compatible with and will not adversely affect the livability or appropriate development of abutting properties and the surrounding area.

F.    Its operation does not result in the transfer, expiration or revocation of a state of California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control license;

G.    A copy of the performance standards shall be posted and remain in a conspicuous and unobstructed place visible from the entrance of the establishment for public review.

H.    Failure to comply with the performance standards set forth herein shall constitute a public nuisance. (Ord. 06-003 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.10.070 Procedure for enforcement of performance standards.
Upon notification that a deemed approved use may be in violation of the performance standards as specified in Section 5.10.060, the following procedure shall be followed:

A.    The police department or an enforcement officer or officers as defined in Section 1.10.020 will assess the nature of the complaint and its validity. In each case, the officers will talk to members of the surrounding community to assess their perception of the alleged violation.

B.    Based upon the findings of the officer, recommendations to ameliorate any problems discovered will be made to the deemed approved use. Such recommendations may include, but are not limited to, suggestions as to the display and location of placement of signs and displays; the frequency of removal of litter and graffiti; training of owners, managers and employees in responsible beverage service and sales; deployment of security guards; and adjustment of hours of operation. After an appropriate period, an officer will revisit the site and surrounding community to determine if the violations have been abated. If the problems have been abated, then a subsequent visit by an officer may be made thirty to sixty days after the last visit to establish that the deemed approved use remains in compliance.

C.    If the problems persist or the owner or operator of the business fails to cooperate with or respond to the notice of violations, the enforcement officer shall forward the materials to the planning director, who shall prepare a report summarizing the enforcement officer’s concerns and any communications from the owner or operator, and attach relevant materials, and agendize a public hearing before the planning commission to determine whether the deemed approved use status of the business should be modified or revoked. In any hearing under this chapter, the enforcement officer(s) shall be considered the prosecutor, and the planning division shall act on behalf of the planning commission or city council to present the issues for decision.

Fees for notification shall be set by resolution of the city council and shall be paid for by the owner of the deemed approved use. (Ord. 06-003 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.10.090 Form of notice of hearing.

5.32.130 Maintenance and inspection requirements.
A.    Requirements for Inspection of Taxicabs and Vehicles for Hire.

1.    Before a vehicle permit is issued to a business owner, each vehicle for which a vehicle permit is requested shall be inspected by the city or shall be delivered to a city-approved vehicle inspection station for inspection of such vehicle and its equipment to ascertain whether such vehicle and equipment comply with the provisions of this chapter. The city shall provide to the business owner a list of approved vehicle inspection stations. Any vehicle which is found after such inspection to be unsafe or in any way unsuitable for service will not be issued a vehicle permit and immediately may be ordered out of service. Before a vehicle permit is issued, or the vehicle is again placed in service, it shall be placed in a safe and sanitary condition, inspected, and a completed “certificate of safety” inspection certificate shall be filed with the city. Before a vehicle permit is issued, or the vehicle is again placed in service, the inspecting garage shall also issue an official smog certificate for each vehicle inspected to accompany the “certificate of safety” inspection certificate. The interior and exterior of any vehicle shall be clean and well maintained as determined by the city and meet California Vehicle Code requirements and the requirements of this chapter at all times when in operation.

2.

B.    Flag Loads Permitted When.

C.    Solicitation of Fares Permitted at Certain Locations. Solicitation of fares is permitted when located at areas as may be declared open to solicitation by all properly permitted business owners or drivers.

H.    Smoking Prohibited. Smoking shall be prohibited in taxicabs and vehicles for hire. The driver of said vehicle shall promptly direct any passenger smoking in a taxicab or vehicle for hire to promptly and safely extinguish any cigarette or other smoking device.

I.    Maintenance and Use of Seatbelts. Every owner or driver of a taxicab operated on a highway shall maintain safety belts in good working order for the use of the occupants of the vehicle. The driver of a taxicab shall not operate the taxicab unless passengers four years of age or over and weighing forty pounds or more, in the front seat, are properly restrained by a safety belt.

5.36.010 Findings.
The city council finds and declares as follows:

A.    The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. The city is authorized, by virtue of the State Constitution and Section 51030 et seq. of the Government Code, to regulate massage establishments by imposing reasonable standards relative to the education and experience of massage therapists and reasonable conditions on the operation of massage establishments.

B.    Massage establishments have been found to present opportunities for unlawful activity.

C.    The California legislature and the courts have long recognized the necessity of imposing reasonable regulations and standards for the operation of massage establishments, including but not limited to minimum educational and experience requirements, passage of a practical examination of competence, sanitary conditions, hours of operation, and other operational regulations designed to minimize opportunities for illegal activities and to ensure the protection of the health, safety and welfare of citizens.

D.    Some establishments, seeking to avoid regulations applicable to massage establishments, attempt to characterize or advertise themselves as “relaxation” or feature other services, including, but not limited to, tanning, hot towel wraps, steam baths, or saunas. Such establishments are considered to be similarly susceptible to opportunities for unlawful activities, and are therefore regulated pursuant to this chapter.

E.    The presence of untrained, inexperienced trainees in massage establishments would foster and encourage prostitution. Further, there is a significant risk of injury to clients of massage establishments by improperly trained and/or educated massage therapists.

F.    The costs of investigation, surveillance and prosecution of criminal activities in or at massage establishments, both in terms of requirements for specialized training and operations, are extraordinary.

G.    Effective investigation, enforcement and prosecution of illegal activities in or at massage establishments often require a disproportionate diversion of public safety and law enforcement resources not only from within the city, but also from other jurisdictions.

H.    Minimum hours of training and experience, restrictions on advertising, and standards for professional conduct contained in this chapter are consistent with recommended standards promulgated by nationally recognized trade organizations for massage therapists.

I.    Licensing standards pertaining to massage establishments are necessary to protect the public’s health and safety and the personal safety of massage therapists. This chapter takes into account the separate certification process of the state Massage Therapy Organization under Business and Professions Code Sections 4600—4620. (Ord. 06-018 § 1 (part), 2006) (Ord. No. 2009-005, § 1, 10-6-09)

“Massage establishment” means any establishment having a fixed place of business where any person, firm, association, partnership, or corporation engages in, conducts, or carries on, or permits to be engaged in, conducted or carried on, any business of giving massage, baths, administration of fomentation, electric or magnetic treatments, alcohol rubs, or any other type of system for treatment or manipulation of the human body with or without any character of bath, such as Turkish, Russian, Swedish, Japanese, vapor, shower, electric tub, sponge, mineral, fomentation, or any other type of bath.

I.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, massage establishments solely owned by state certificate holders or which employ only persons who hold a state certificate remain subject to all health and safety requirements set forth in this chapter unless specifically exempted. Such health and safety requirements include Section 5.36.120, subsections F, G, J, K, L and O through U, and Section 5.36.130. (Ord. 06-018 § 1 (part), 2006) (Ord. No. 2009-005, §§ 4, 5, 10-6-09)

5.36.050 Massage establishment permit application fee.
Any application for a massage establishment or massage therapist permit, or for the renewal thereof, shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee as set by resolution of the city council and shall be paid to the city to defray, in part, the cost of the investigation and report required by this chapter. A massage therapist permit shall not authorize the operation of a massage establishment. A person licensed as a massage therapist who desires to operate a massage establishment also must obtain a massage establishment permit. (Ord. 06-018 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.36.060 Application for massage establishment permit.

5.38.010 Findings.
The city council finds and declares as follows:

A.    The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.

B.    Escort service businesses have been found to present opportunities for unlawful activity, including acts of prostitution, pimping and pandering. The establishment of standards for issuance of permits and reasonable restrictions on operation would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity.

C.    The costs of investigation, surveillance and prosecution of criminal activities associated with escort services can be extraordinary. Effective investigation, enforcement and prosecution of illegal activities associated with escort services often require a disproportionate diversion of public safety and law enforcement resources not only from within one city, but also from other jurisdictions. The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter reduce the burden on the city and permit the deployment of law enforcement personnel such that other serious crimes may be prevented and other important laws be enforced.

D.    The regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter are designed to prevent escort services from fostering unlawful activity, and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved. (Ord. 06-019 § 1 (part), 2006)

B.    Every escort service permit holder shall report immediately to the chief of police any and all changes of ownership or management of the escort service, including, but not limited to, changes of manager or other persons in charge, stockholders holding more than five percent of the stock of the corporation, officers, directors, and partners, any and all changes of name, style or designation under which the business is to be conducted, and all changes of address or telephone numbers of the escort service.

C.    A separate permit shall be required for each location of an escort service, but separate permits need not be obtained by an escort employed in more than one location within the city for each such location; provided, that the application for a single escort permit for more than one escort service location shall disclose each location at which the escort is or intends to be employed. If an escort permittee changes his or her business address, or accepts employment by any escort service other than those previously disclosed in an escort permit application, the permittee shall, within seven days after such change occurs, advise the chief of police, in writing, of the name, business address and telephone number of the permittee’s new employer(s).

D.    When any change occurs during the life of an escort service permit or escort permit, other than when a renewal application is pending, regarding the written information required to be submitted to the chief of police in connection with a permit application pursuant to this chapter, the permittee must provide written notification of such change to the chief of police within thirty days of the change.

B.    An application for renewal of an existing escort service permit or escort permit shall be accompanied by a renewal fee, as set by resolution of the city council, to cover staff costs to process the renewal application.

It is the intent and purpose of the city council, in adopting this chapter, to regulate those activities which, in the most technical sense have business or commercial characteristics but which, because of the manner in which they are conducted or the purposes for which they are being operated are truly noncommercial in nature. Said regulations are intended to prevent the expansion of such noncommercial operations into truly commercial operations and to regulate the method of conducting the activity so that it will be confined to a noncommercial type of operation. It is the purpose of this chapter to prevent such activities from unfairly competing with licensed revenue-producing commercial and business enterprises, to prevent the conduct of commercial enterprises upon other than commercially zoned property, and to curb the evasion of business license fees.

For the purposes of this chapter, “garage sale” means a sale conducted by an individual homeowner, apartment dweller or occupant of a dwelling unit, for the purpose of disposing of unwanted or surplus household furnishings or other personalty, usually conducted in a garage in a residential zone and for which no inventory is kept and no sales tax is paid on the transactions thus carried out. It may, at times, be conducted by a combination of residential dwellers at a single location and may take on the nature and character of a rummage sale or fundraising event for civic or charitable purposes. Said garage sales shall not extend beyond a period of ten days for any one sale. “Garage sale” shall not be limited to sales conducted in the garage, but shall encompass household sales conducted on any portion of the premises. (Ord. 621 § 1(3), 1971)

5.40.030 License requirements.

2.    The location where the sale shall be conducted, including a general designation of the area of the premises where the actual sale is to be carried out;

3.    A general description of the property to be offered for sale;

4.    The dates and time period when the sale shall be conducted;

5.    An affidavit or declaration, under penalty or perjury, that the person or persons conducting the sale are the owners of the property offered for sale, that all of the goods are secondhand, and that no previous garage sale has been held in the calendar year.

B.    No more than one garage sale may be conducted by the same person or persons within the same calendar year. A garage sale license shall be limited to a period of ten days per sale. All personalty and furnishing must be the property of those conducting the sale, and must be used goods.

C.    The license may be secured either at the office of the business license administrator, or by telephoning the finance officer, who will mail the appropriate form and license to the party so requesting, and who shall, in turn, mail the completed application back to the office of the business license administrator with the application fee.

D.    Each person applying for a garage sale license/permit shall pay a fee of five dollars at the time of application. (Ord. 86-008 § 4(1), 1986: Ord. 621 § 1(C), 1971)

Due to the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable services, the city further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by the city’s exercise of its regulatory powers. This article is intended to specify the means for providing to the public the best possible cable services, and every franchise issued in accordance with this article is intended to achieve this primary objective. It is the further intent of this article to adopt regulatory provisions that will enable the city to regulate cable services to the maximum extent authorized by federal and state law. (Ord. 06-001 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.64.025 Franchise terms and conditions.
A.    Franchise Purposes. A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this article may authorize the grantee to do the following:

1.    To engage in the business of providing cable service as may be authorized by law and which grantee elects to provide to its subscribers within the designated franchise service area;

2.    To maintain and operate the franchise properties for the origination, reception, transmission, amplification, and distribution of television and radio signals, and for the delivery of cable services as may be authorized by law;

3.    To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines, related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in connection with the operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across streets or other public places within the designated franchise service area.

B.    Franchise Required. It is unlawful for any person to construct, install, or operate a cable television system within any street or public way in the area under the jurisdiction of the city without first obtaining a franchise under the provisions of this article.

C.    Term of the Franchise.

1.    A franchise granted under this article will be for the term specified in the franchise agreement, commencing upon the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or resolution adopted by the city that authorizes the franchise.

2.    A franchise granted under this article or a franchise granted by the city under a prior ordinance may be renewed upon application by the grantee in accordance with the then-applicable provisions of state and federal law and of this article.

D.    Franchise Territory. A franchise is effective within the entire area that is subject to the jurisdiction of the city unless otherwise specified in the ordinance codified in this chapter or resolution granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement.

E.    Federal or State Jurisdiction. This article will be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this article, to the extent authorized by applicable law.

F.    Franchise Nontransferable.

1.    The grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the city and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the city, which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the city is null and void. The granting of a security interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or other hypothecation, will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this subsection.

2.    The requirements of subsection (F)(1) of this section apply to any change in control of the grantee or any parent company of the grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to the ownership of major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If the grantee is a corporation, prior authorization of the city is required where ownership or control of twenty-five percent or more of the voting stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom, singularly or collectively, owns or controls the voting stock of the grantee as of the effective date of the franchise. A transfer of the franchise from one wholly owned subsidiary to another wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company shall not be considered a change or control or a transfer of the franchise for the purposes of this subsection.

3.    The grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the grantee’s franchise property. That notification will be considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this subsection that require the prior consent of the city to that change in control of ownership will apply.

4.    For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an acquisition, transfer, or change in control, the city may inquire as to the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the grantee must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city’s consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee or the proposed transferee, or both, must complete Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or its equivalent, and provide any other information required by the city which is relevant to the transferee’s qualifications and capability to operate and maintain the cable system and comply with all franchise requirements. This application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee must establish that it possesses the legal, financial, and technical capability to operate and maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements during the remaining term of the franchise in a substantially equivalent or greater manner than the transferor. The transferee also must establish that it will timely correct any pending franchise violations in the manner prescribed by the city. The consent of the city to the proposed transfer will not be unreasonably denied or delayed provided that all requirements of federal and state law, this article and the franchise agreement are satisfied.

5.    Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee’s assets to secure the advance of money for the construction or operation of the franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or a designee satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television system upon the grantee’s default in its financial obligations. Further, that financial institution also must submit a plan for such operation within ninety days after assuming control. The plan must insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that the financial institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution may not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless authorized by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period of time it will have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another grantee.

6.    The grantee must reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable review and processing expenses incurred in connection with any transfer or change in control of the franchise. These expenses may include, without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document preparation expenses. The total amount of these reimbursable expenses may be subject to maximum limits that are specified in the franchise agreement between the city and the grantee. No reimbursement may be offset against any franchise fee payable to the city during the remaining term of the franchise.

7.    Approval by the city of a transfer shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or the franchise agreement.

G.    Geographical Coverage.

1.    Grantee must design, construct, and maintain the cable television system so as to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the franchise service area, subject to any service-area line extension requirements of the franchise agreement.

2.    After service has been established by activating trunk or distribution cables for any service area, grantee must provide service to any requesting subscriber in that service area within thirty days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that thirty-day period. Service to prospective subscribers residing in multiple dwelling units need only be provided if, after evaluating terms and conditions for access that may be imposed by an owner or manager of such multiple dwelling units, a grantee determines that those terms and conditions are reasonably acceptable.

H.    Nonexclusive Franchise. Every franchise granted is nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable system, or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. If an additional franchise is proposed to be granted to a subsequent grantee, a noticed public hearing must first be held in accordance with the provisions of Government Code Section 53066.3.

I.    Multiple Franchises.

1.    The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable state and federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as:

a.    The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas, and sewerage.

b.    The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.

c.    The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations within the public rights-of-way.

2.    The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the associated costs if, in the city’s opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot reasonably accommodate additional cables. (Ord. 06-001 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.64.030 Franchise applications and renewal.
A.    Filing of Applications. Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable television system must file an application with the city.

2.    A public hearing will be noticed prior to the granting of any initial franchise, at a time and date approved by the city. Within thirty days after the close of the hearing, the city will make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether the franchise should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. The city may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise.

D.    Franchise Renewal. Franchise renewals will be processed in accordance with then-applicable law. The city and the grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. (Ord. 06-001 § 1 (part), 2006)

1.    Except as otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, the grantee must maintain the necessary facilities, equipment, and personnel to comply with the following consumer protection and service standards under normal operating conditions:

a.    Sufficient toll-free telephone line capacity during normal business hours to ensure that telephone answer time by a customer service representative, including wait time, may not exceed thirty seconds. Callers needing to be transferred may not be required to wait more than thirty seconds before being connected to a service representative.

b.    Under normal operating conditions, a caller must receive a busy signal less than three percent of the time.

c.    Emergency toll-free telephone line capacity on a twenty-four hour basis, including weekends and holidays. After normal business hours, the telephone calls may be answered by an answering service in accordance with the telephone answering standards set forth in subsections (A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) of this section. Calls received after normal business hours must be responded to by a trained company representative on the next business day.

d.    A conveniently located local business and service or payment office open during normal business hours at least eight hours daily on weekdays, and at least four hours weekly on evenings or weekends, and adequately staffed with trained customer service representatives to accept subscriber payments and to respond to service requests, inquiries and complaints.

g.    The grantee must schedule, within a specified four-hour time period Monday through Saturday (legal holidays excluded), all appointments with subscribers for installation of service, service calls, and other activities at the subscriber location. The grantee may schedule installation and service calls outside of normal business hours for the convenience of the subscriber. The grantee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber after the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. If a grantee representative is running late for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the scheduled appointment, the subscriber must be contacted prior to the time of the scheduled appointment and the appointment must be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time that is convenient for the subscriber. The grantee must use its best efforts to contact every customer within two weeks after an installation or repair work is completed to ensure that the customer is satisfied with the work.

h.    Subscribers who have experienced one missed appointment due to the fault of the grantee will receive an on-time guarantee refund or other equivalent compensation if the appointment was for an installation. If an installation was to have been provided free of charge, and for all other appointments, the subscriber will receive the same on-time guarantee refund or other equivalent compensation.

i.    Upon subscriber request, the grantee will arrange for pickup and/or replacement of convertors or other equipment provided by the grantee at the subscriber’s address within fourteen days after the request is made if the subscriber is mobility-limited.

2.    The standards of subsections (A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(c) of this section shall be met not less than ninety percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis.

B.    Service Standards.

1.    The grantee will render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Except in emergency situations, scheduled interruptions will occur during a period of minimum use of the cable system, preferably between midnight and six a.m. Unless the scheduled interruption lasts for no more than two hours and occurs between midnight and six a.m. (in which event twenty-four hours prior notice must be given to the city), forty-eight hours prior notice must be given to subscribers.

2.    The grantee will maintain a repair force of technicians who will respond to subscriber requests for service within the following time frames:

a.    For a system outage: within four hours, including weekends, of receiving subscriber calls or requests for service that by number identify a system outage of sound or picture of one or more channels, affecting five or more subscribers of the system.

b.    For an isolated outage: within twenty-four hours, including weekends, of receiving requests for service identifying an isolated outage of sound or picture for one or more channels.

c.    For inferior signal quality: no later than the following business day, excluding Sundays and holidays, of receiving a request for service identifying a problem concerning picture or sound quality.

3.    The grantee will be deemed to have responded to a request for service under the provisions of this subsection when a technician arrives at the service location and begins work on the problem. If a subscriber is not home when the technician arrives, the technician must leave written notification of arrival.

4.    The grantee may not charge for the repair or replacement of defective or malfunctioning equipment provided by the grantee to subscribers, unless the defect was caused by the subscriber.

5.    The grantee must determine the nature of the problem within twenty-four hours of commencing work and resolve all cable system related problems within three business days, unless technically infeasible.

C.    Billing and Information Standards.

1.    Subscriber bills must be clear, concise, and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills also must clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, and credits.

2.    The first billing to a subscriber after a new installation or service change must be prorated based upon when the new or changed service commenced. Subscribers must not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure by the grantee, including the failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber.

3.    In case of a billing dispute, the grantee must respond in writing to a written complaint from a subscriber within ten days of receiving the complaint at the office clearly identified on the billing statement for receiving such complaint.

4.    The grantee must provide credits or refunds to subscribers whose service has been interrupted for four or more hours upon request from the affected subscribers. For each day that service has been interrupted for four hours or more, the credit must equal a pro-rata share of the monthly billing for one full day. All credits for service must be issued no later than the customer’s next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. For subscribers terminating service, refunds must be issued promptly, but no later than thirty days after the return of any grantee-supplied equipment.

5.    The grantee must provide written information which has been reviewed by the city on each of the following areas at the time of the installation of service, at least annually to all subscribers, and at any time upon request:

b.    Prices and options for programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other services;

c.    Installation and service maintenance policies;

d.    Instructions on the use of the cable service;

e.    Channel positions of programming carried on the system;

f.    Billing and complaint procedures, including the address and telephone number of the city’s office designated for dealing with cable-related issues;

g.    Consumer protection and service standards and penalties for noncompliance.

6.    Subscribers must be notified of any changes in rates, programming services, or channel positions as soon as possible through announcements in writing. Written notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of thirty days in advance of those changes if the change is within the control of the grantee. In addition, the grantee must notify subscribers through announcements in writing thirty days in advance of any significant changes in the information required in subsection (C)(5) of this section.

7.    The grantee must maintain a public file containing all notices provided to subscribers under these consumer protection and service standards and all promotional offers made by grantee to subscribers. Such documents must be maintained for a minimum period of four years.

D.    Verification of Compliance with Standards.

1.    Upon fifteen days written notice, the city may require the grantee to provide a written report demonstrating its compliance with any of the customer service standards specified in this section. The grantee must provide sufficient documentation to enable the city to verify compliance.

2.    A repeated and verifiable pattern of noncompliance with the consumer protection and service standards of this section, after the grantee’s receipt of written notice and an opportunity to cure, may be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement.

E.    Subscriber Complaints and Disputes.

1.    The grantee must establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon, and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the city. The written procedures must prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint, either orally or in writing, specifying the subscriber’s grounds for dissatisfaction. The grantee must file a copy of these procedures with the city. These procedures must include a requirement that the grantee respond in writing to any written complaint from a subscriber within ten days of receiving the complaint at the office clearly identified on the billing statement for receiving such complaint.

2.    The city has the right to review the grantee’s response to subscriber complaints in order to determine the grantee’s compliance with the franchise requirements.

3.    All subscribers have the right to continue receiving service so long as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or if the city gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, the grantee must act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive service while the franchise remains in force.

4.    Upon a change of control of the grantee, or if a new operator acquires the cable system, the original grantee must cooperate with the city, the new grantee, or the new operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During that transition period, the grantee is entitled to the revenues derived from its operation of the system.

F.    Disconnection/Downgrades.

1.    A subscriber may terminate or downgrade service at any time, and the grantee must promptly comply with the subscriber’s request within seven days or at the time requested by the subscriber provided that the billing for the terminated service is stopped on the date that the subscriber requests termination. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of service may be required of subscribers. Grantee will impose no charges for the voluntary termination or downgrade of service unless a visit to the subscriber’s premises is required to remove a converter box or other equipment or property owned by grantee.

2.    The grantee may disconnect a subscriber’s service if the subscriber fails to pay a monthly fee or charge, but such disconnection must not occur prior to forty-five days after the fee or charge is due plus ten days prior written notice to the subscriber of the grantee’s intent to disconnect service. In the event that the subscriber pays all past due amounts, including late charges, before the scheduled disconnection date, the grantee may not disconnect service. In the event that service is disconnected for nonpayment of past due fees or charges, the grantee must promptly reinstate service upon payment by the subscriber in full of all such fees and charges, including late charges.

3.    Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (F)(2) of this section, the grantee may immediately disconnect service to a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or destroying the grantee’s cable system or equipment. In the event of disconnection on such grounds, the grantee will resume service to the subscriber upon receiving adequate assurances that the subscriber has ceased the practices or conduct that resulted in disconnection and has paid all proper fees and charges, including any amounts reasonably owed the grantee for the damage caused by the subscriber.

4.    The grantee also may disconnect service to a subscriber that is causing signal leakage exceeding federal limits. In the event that service is disconnected, the grantee will immediately resume service without charge upon the satisfactory correction of the signal leakage problem.

5.    Upon termination of service to a subscriber, the grantee will remove its equipment from the subscriber’s premises within thirty days. The equipment will be deemed abandoned if it is not removed within such time period unless the grantee has been denied access to the subscriber’s premises.

G.    Changes in Service. Except as otherwise provided by federal law, subscribers must not be required to pay any additional fee or charge, other than the regular service fee, in order to receive the services selected (such as upgrade or downgrade charges). No charge may be imposed for any service or product that the subscriber has not affirmatively selected. Payment of the regular monthly bill will not by itself constitute an affirmative selection.

H.    Deposits. The grantee may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory deposit on equipment provided to subscribers. Such deposits must be placed in an interest bearing account. The deposit must be returned, with interest earned to the date of repayment, within thirty days after the equipment is returned to the grantee.

I.    Parental Control Option. The grantee must provide parental control devices to all subscribers who want to be able to block the video or audio portion of any programming that the subscriber finds objectionable. Such devices will be provided at no charge to the subscriber, unless otherwise required by federal law or unless a converter box is required to be installed for the purpose of providing the parental control device.

J.    Additional Requirements.

1.    If the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days without the city’s prior approval or subsequent ratification, the city may, at its sole option, operate the system or designate an operator until the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city, or until a permanent operator is selected. If the city satisfies this obligation on behalf of the grantee, then during that time period the city is entitled to collect all revenues derived from the system, and the grantee will indemnify the city against any damages that the city may suffer as a result of the grantee’s failure to operate the system.

2.    All officers, agents, or employees of the grantee, or its contractors or subcontractors, who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public, or who require entry onto subscribers’ premises, must carry a photo-identification card in a form approved by the city. The grantee must account for all identification cards at all times. All vehicles of the grantee or its subcontractors shall be clearly identified as vehicles engaged in providing services for the grantee.

3.    Additional standards relating to service, consumer protection, and response by the grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement or by separate ordinance, and the grantee must comply with those standards in the operation of the cable television system. A verified and continuing pattern of noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise, provided that the grantee receives written notice and an opportunity to cure, before any remedy is imposed.

K.    Penalties for Noncompliance.

1.    Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to impose penalties for the violation of the customer service standards established by this chapter as authorized by the Video Customer Service Act (Government Code Section 53088 et seq.). These penalties are in addition to any other remedies provided by this chapter, the franchise agreement or any other law, and the city has the discretion to elect which remedy it will apply. The imposition of penalties pursuant to this subsection will not prevent the city or any other affected party from exercising any other remedy to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to any judicial remedy as provided by subsection (K)(2)(d) of this section.

2.    Administration and Appeals.

a.    The city manager is authorized to administer this subsection. Decisions by the city manager to assess penalties against the grantee shall be in writing and shall contain findings supporting the decisions. Decisions by the city manager shall be final, unless appealed to the city council.

b.    In the event that the grantee or any interested person is aggrieved by a decision of the city manager, the aggrieved party may, within ten days of the written decision, appeal that decision in writing to the city council. The appeal letter must be accompanied by the fee established by the council for processing the appeal. The council may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the city manager.

c.    Schedule of Penalties. The following schedule of monetary penalties may be assessed against the grantee for material breach of the provisions of the customer service standards set forth in this chapter, provided the breach is not out of the reasonable control of the grantee.

i.    The maximum penalty shall be two hundred dollars for each day of material breach, but shall not exceed six hundred dollars for each occurrence of the material breach.

ii.    For a second material breach of the same nature within a twelve-month period for which the city has provided notice and a penalty has been assessed, the maximum penalty shall be four hundred dollars for each day of the material breach, but shall not exceed one thousand two hundred dollars for each occurrence of the material breach.

iii.    For a third material breach of the same nature within a twelve-month period for which the city has provided notice and a penalty has been assessed, the maximum penalty shall be one thousand dollars for each day of the material breach, but shall not exceed three thousand dollars for each occurrence of the material breach.

iv.    The above maximum penalties may be increased by any additional amount authorized by state law.

d.    Judicial Remedy. This subsection shall not preclude any affected party from utilizing any judicial remedy available to that party without regard to this subsection.

e.    Notification of Breach. The city shall give the grantee written notice of any alleged breaches of the consumer service standards and allow the grantee at least thirty days from receipt of the notice to remedy the specified breach. For the purpose of assessing penalties, a material breach shall be deemed to have occurred for each day, following the expiration of the period specified herein, that any breach has not been remedied by the grantee, irrespective of the number of subscribers affected.

5.64.055 Review of the application.
Within thirty days after receipt of an application filed under Section 5.64.050 of this chapter that the city manager deems to be complete, the city manager will give written notice to the applicant of the city’s intent to negotiate an agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city. The commencement of those negotiations will be on a date that is mutually acceptable to the city and to the applicant. (Ord. 06-001 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.64.060 Agreement required.
A.    No video programming services may be provided within the city’s jurisdiction by an open video system operator unless the operator and the city have executed a written agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open video system will be authorized by the city.

B.    The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may contain terms and conditions that relate to the following subject matters, to the extent that such terms, conditions, and subject matters are not preempted by federal law:

1.    The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including provisions for its renewal or extension;

2.    The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the city, at specified times, fees on the gross revenues received by the operator, as authorized by 47 CFR Section 76.1511, in accordance with the following standards and procedures:

a.    The amount of the fees on the gross revenues will be five percent, and will be paid in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under Section 622 of the Communications Act.

b.    The term “gross revenues” means: (i) all gross revenues received by an open video system operator or its affiliates, including all revenues received from subscribers and all carriage revenues received from unaffiliated video programming providers; and (ii) all advertising revenues received by the operator or its affiliates in connection with the provision of video programming, where these revenues are included in the calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the city by the franchised cable operator. The term “gross revenues” does not include revenues, such as subscriber or advertising revenues, collected by unaffiliated video programming providers;

3.    The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with requirements relating to information collection and recordkeeping, accounting procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and inspection of records in order to ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenues that are required to be paid as specified above in subsection (B)(2);

4.    The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city’s requirements with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment, as provided for in 47 CFR Section 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and procedures are applicable:

a.    The open video system operator is subject to the same public, educational, and governmental access requirements that apply within the cable television franchise service area with which its system overlaps.

b.    The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers receive all public, educational, and governmental access channels within the franchise service area in which the city’s subscribers are located.

c.    The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to establish the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment. These negotiations may include the city’s franchised cable operator if the city, the open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so desire.

d.    If the open video system operator and the city are unable to reach an agreement regarding the operator’s obligations with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment within the city’s jurisdiction, then the following obligations will be imposed:

i.    The open video system operator must satisfy the same public, educational, and governmental access obligations as the city’s franchised cable operator by providing the same amount of channel capacity for public, educational, and governmental access and by matching the city’s franchised cable operator’s annual financial contributions in support of public, educational, and governmental access services, facilities, and equipment. For in-kind contributions, such as cameras or production studios, the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory obligation by negotiating mutually agreeable terms with the city’s franchised cable operator, so that public, educational, and governmental access services to the city are improved or increased. If these terms cannot be agreed upon, the open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary equivalent of the franchised cable operator’s depreciated in-kind contribution, or, in the case of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions provided by the open video system operator must be used to fund public, educational, and governmental access activities provided under Section 611 of the Communications Act.

ii.    The city will impose upon the open video system operator the same rules and procedures that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator with regard to the open video system operator’s use of channel capacity designated for public, educational, and governmental access use when that capacity is not being used for these purposes.

e.    The city’s franchised cable operator is required under federal law to permit the open video system operator to connect with its public, educational, and governmental access channel feeds. The open video system operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to accomplish this connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical characteristics of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the franchised cable operator and the open video system operator cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the city has the right to decide. The city may require that the connection occur on publicly owned property or on public rights-of-way.

f.    All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator’s public, educational, and governmental access channel feed must be borne by the open video system operator. These costs will be counted towards the open video system operator’s matching financial contributions set forth above in subsection (B)(4)(d)(i).

g.    The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any public, educational, or governmental access obligations that are greater than those imposed upon the franchised cable operator.

h.    If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the provisions of 47 CFR Section 76.1505(d)(6) will be applicable in determining the obligations of the open video system operator.

i.    The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply with new public, educational, and access obligations imposed on the city’s franchised cable operator following a renewal of the cable television franchise; provided, however, that the open video system operator will not be required to displace other programmers using its open video system to accommodate public, educational, and governmental access channels. The open video system operator must comply with these new public, educational, and governmental access obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes available, whether it is due to increased channel capacity or to decreased demand for channel capacity;

5.    If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree as to the application of the FCC’s rules regarding the open video system operator’s obligations to provide public, educational, and governmental access under the provisions of subsection (B)(4) set forth in this section, then either party may file a complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in 47 CFR Section 76.1514. No agreement under this section authorizing an applicant to provide services over an open video system will be executed by the city until the dispute has been finally resolved;

6.    If the open video system operator intends to maintain an institutional network, as defined in Section 611(f) of the Communications Act, the city will require that educational and governmental access channels be designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those channels are designated on the institutional network of the city’s franchised cable operator;

7.    The authority of an open video system provider to exercise editorial control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel capacity will be restricted in accordance with the provisions of 47 CFR Section 76.1505(f);

8.    The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all applicable federal and state statutes and regulations relating to customer service standards, including the Cable Television and Video Customer Service and Information Act (Government Code Sections 53054, et seq.), and the Video Customer Service Act (Government Code Sections 53088, et seq.);

9.    If new physical plant is proposed to be constructed, the obligation of the open video system operator to comply with the following rights-of-way use and management responsibilities that are also imposed by the city upon other telecommunications service providers in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:

a.    Compliance with all applicable building and zoning codes, including applications for excavation, encroachment, and construction permits and the payment of all required permit and inspection fees,

b.    The coordination of construction requirements,

c.    Compliance with established standards and procedures for constructing lines across private property,

d.    Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification requirements,

e.    The repair and resurfacing of construction-damaged streets,

f.    Compliance with all public safety requirements that are applicable to telecommunications service providers using public property or public rights-of-way;

10.    Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the agreement, and the applicable penalties, liquidated damages, and other remedies, including fines or the suspension, revocation, or termination of the agreement;

11.    Requirements relating to the sale, assignment, or transfer of the open video system;

12.    Requirements relating to the open video system operator’s compliance with and implementation of state and federal laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to the operation of the open video system;

13.    Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies, and procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the city and the open video system operator and that will, in the judgment of the city, best serve the public interest and protect the public health, welfare, and safety. (Ord. 06-001 § 1 (part), 2006)

IV. Other Telecommunications Services and Systems

5.64.065 Other multichannel video programming distributors.
The term “cable system,” as defined in federal law and as set forth in Article I of this chapter, does not include a facility that serves subscribers without using any public rights-of-way. Consequently, the categories of multichannel video programming distributors identified below are not deemed to be “cable systems” and are therefore exempt under federal law from the city’s franchise requirements and from certain other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law, provided that their distribution or transmission facilities do not involve the use of any public rights-of-way.

A.    Multichannel multipoint distribution service (“MMDS”), also known as “wireless cable,” which typically involves the transmission by an FCC-licensed operator of numerous broadcast stations from a central location using line-of-sight technology.

B.    Local multipoint distribution service (“LMDS”), another form of over-the-air wireless video service for which licenses are auctioned by the FCC, and which offers video programming, telephony, and data networking services.

C.    Direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”), also referred to as “direct-to-home satellite services,” which involves the distribution or broadcasting of programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber’s premises without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the subscriber’s premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local regulation of direct-to-home satellite services is further proscribed by the following federal statutory provisions:

1.    47 U.S.C. Section 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of direct-to-home satellite services.

2.    Section 602 of the Communications Act states that a provider of direct-to-home satellite service is exempt from the collection or remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by any local taxing jurisdiction on direct-to-home satellite service. The terms “tax” and “fee” are defined by federal statute to mean any local sales tax, local use tax, local intangible tax, local income tax, business license tax, utility tax, privilege tax, gross receipts tax, excise tax, franchise fees, local telecommunications tax, or any other tax, license, or fee that is imposed for the privilege of doing business, regulating, or raising revenue for a local taxing jurisdiction. (Ord. 06-001 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.64.070 Video providers—Registration—Customer service standards.
A.    Unless the customer protection and customer service obligations of a video provider, as that term is defined in Article I of this chapter, are specified in a franchise, license, lease, or similar written agreement with the city, a video provider must comply with all applicable provisions of the following state statutes:

1.    The Cable Television and Video Customer Service and Information Act (Government Code Section 53054, et seq.);

2.    The Video Customer Service Act (Government Code Section 53088, et seq.).

B.    The city’s jurisdiction on the effective date of this chapter, or that intend to operate in this jurisdiction after the effective date of this chapter, must register with the city; provided, however, that this registration requirement is not applicable to any video provider that has executed a franchise, license, lease or similar written agreement with the city. The registration form must include or be accompanied by the following:

1.    The video provider’s name, address, and local telephone numbers, including a twenty-four hour telephone number for emergency service;

2.    The names of the officers, the general manager, and principal technical staff members of the video provider;

3.    A copy of the video provider’s written policies and procedures relating to customer service standards and the handling of customer complaints, as required by Government Code Section 53054, et seq. These customer service standards must include, without limitation, standards regarding the following:

a.    Installation, disconnection, service and repair obligations, employee identification, and service call response time and scheduling,

b.    Customer service telephone and office hours,

c.    Procedures for billing, charges, refunds, and credits,

d.    Procedures for termination of service,

e.    Notice of the deletion of a programming service, the changing of channel assignments, or an increase in rates,

f.    Complaint procedures and procedures for bill dispute resolution,

g.    The video provider’s written commitment to distribute annually to the city, and to the provider’s employees and customers, a notice describing the customer service standards specified above in subsections (B)(3)(a) through (B)(3)(f). This annual notice must include the report of the video provider on its performance in meeting its customer service standards, as required by Government Code Section 53055.2;

4.    Unless a video provider is exempt under federal law from its payment, a registration fee in an amount established by resolution of the city to cover the costs reasonably incurred by the city in reviewing and processing the registration form;

5.    In addition to the registration fee specified above in subsection (B)(4), the written commitment of the video provider to pay to the city, when due, all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the city in resolving any disputes between the video provider and its subscribers, which dispute resolution is mandated by Government Code Section 53088.2(o).

C.    The city may establish by ordinance a schedule of monetary penalties for the material breach by a video provider of its obligations under subsections (a) through (n) of Government Code Section 53088.2. As used herein, the term “material breach” means any substantial and repeated failure to comply with the consumer service standards set forth in Government Code Section 53088.2. The provisions of that ordinance must be consistent with the provisions of Government Code Section 53088.2. The schedule of monetary penalties may also impose a penalty, as authorized by Government Code Section 53056(a), for the failure of a video provider to distribute the annual notice required by Government Code Section 53055.1, which penalty may not exceed five hundred dollars for each year in which the notice is not distributed as required by state statute. (Ord. 06-001 § 1 (part), 2006)

5.64.090 Customer service standards and penalties for material breach.
A.    Pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 5900, video service providers that have been issued a state franchise pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 5840 must comply with the provisions of Sections 53055, 53055.1, 53055.2, and 53088.2 of the California Government Code, and any other customer service standards pertaining to the provision of video service established by federal law or regulation and any laws subsequently enacted by the California Legislature (the “customer service standards”).

B.    The customer service standards also include California Penal Code Section 637.5 and the privacy standards contained in the Federal Cable Act, at 47 U.S.C. Section 551, et seq.

C.    The city shall enforce the customer service standards within the city’s jurisdiction, pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 5900(c).

D.    Prior to imposing the penalties provided by this section, the city shall notify video service providers in writing of any material breach of these customer service standards. The video service provider shall have thirty days from the receipt of the notice to remedy the specified material breach.

E.    A material breach of the customer service standards is punishable by a penalty of five hundred dollars for each day of each material breach, not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars for each occurrence of a material breach.

F.    If a subsequent material breach of the same standard occurs within twelve months, the repeat material breach is punishable by a penalty of one thousand dollars for each day of each material breach, not to exceed three thousand dollars for each occurrence of the material breach.

G.    If a third or further material breach of the same standard occurs within twelve months of the first breach, the repeat material breach or breaches are punishable by a penalty of two thousand five hundred dollars for each day of each material breach, not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars for each occurrence of the material breach.

H.    Acts or omissions of a video service provider that result in breaches of two or more different customer service standards will be treated and penalized as separate material breaches of each violated standard.

I.    This section shall not apply to any video service provider providing video services pursuant to a franchise agreement with the city. (Ord. 08-002 § 2 (part), 2008)

5.64.100 Public, educational, and governmental (PEG) access fee.
A.    Pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 5870(n), the city establishes a public, educational, and governmental (PEG) access fee.

B.    Video service providers that have been issued a state franchise pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 5840, shall designate a sufficient amount of capacity on their networks to allow the provision of the same number of PEG channels as are provided by the incumbent cable operator, as defined in California Public Utilities Code Section 5830(j). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such video service providers shall provide an additional PEG channel when the nonduplicated locally produced video programming televised on a given channel exceeds fifty-six hours per week as measured on a quarterly basis.

C.    Video service providers that have been issued a state franchise must pay to the city a PEG access fee of one percent of the video service provider’s gross revenues to support PEG channels consistent with federal law.

If the video service provider does not pay the PEG access fee when due, the video service provider shall pay interest at a rate per year equal to the prime interest rate published from time to time in the Wall Street Journal, plus one percentage point, from the date such amount was due, to and including the date of payment.

E.    Pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 5860(i), the video service provider must keep records of its gross revenues for at least four years after those revenues are recognized in its books.

A.    The board of supervisors of Contra Costa County, an agency of the state of California within the meaning of Government Code Section 50022.1, has adopted Division 416, “Animals,” of the Contra Costa County Code, which constitutes Chapters 416-2 to 416-12 of the county ordinance code and is a codification of county ordinances Nos. 80-97, 83-10, 85-23, 87-74, 97-3, 2005-24, 2006-05, 2011-08, 2011-09, 2014-09, 2014-14, 2016-02, 2017-12 and 2018-13. These county ordinances may be referred to as the “animal control code” or “county ordinances.” The animal control code addresses animal control, licensing, impoundment, rabies control, wild or exotic animals, disposal, noise, dangerous animals, sale and other animal regulations.

B.    The animal control code, Division 416 of the Contra Costa County Code, is a code within the meaning of California Government Code Section 50022.1 and copies of it are on file with the city clerk where they are open to public inspection, as required by California Government Code Section 50022.3.

A.    The animal control code referred to and adopted in this chapter contains the provisions of those sections of the California Food and Agricultural Code referred to in Section 30501, and therefore, this chapter constitutes the city’s request that the provisions of the animal control code be applicable within this city, and they shall so apply pursuant to Food and Agricultural Code Section 30501. The provisions of this chapter shall be enforced by the Contra Costa Animal Services Department pursuant to an agreement between the city of San Pablo and Contra Costa County.

B.    Such request and contract with the Contra Costa Animal Services Department does not preclude the San Pablo Police Department from enforcing the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 18-005 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 83-008 § 1(B), 1983)

6.04.021 Notice and contract with the county.

1.    For a continuing violation, the amount of the fine is one hundred dollars for the first notice of fine. If the owner fails to correct the violation after the first notice of fine, and a second notice of fine is issued in the same year, the amount of the fine in the second notice is two hundred dollars. If the owner still fails to correct the violation after the second notice of fine, the amount of the fine is five hundred dollars for each additional notice of fine that is sent within one year.

2.    If the violation is not a continuing violation, the amount of the fine is one hundred dollars for a first violation, two hundred dollars for a second violation of the same ordinance within one year, and five hundred dollars for each additional violation of the same ordinance within one year.

G.    The county animal services department may issue an administrative penalty under Article 416-4.8 to any responsible person for a violation of Section 416-12.202, “Animal Noise,” based on either or both of the following:

1.    An observation of the violation by a department employee.

2.    A complaint, signed under penalty of perjury, lodged by a person who has been disturbed by the barking dog or noisy animal.

H.

A convicted felon under Article 416-12.4 shall not include felons whose convictions were set aside pursuant to Penal Code Section 1203.4. “Misuse” by a convicted felon means use of a dog in a threatening or aggressive manner, or in the commission of a crime. (Ord. 18-005 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 06-002 § 2, 2006; Ord. 97-008 § 1, 1997; Ord. 88-004 § 1 (part), 1988)

8.02.010 Findings.
A.    The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by requiring a level of maintenance of property which will protect the habitability, appearance and social and economic stability of the city, and which will protect the public from health and safety hazards and the impairment of property values which result from the neglect and deterioration of property into substandard conditions.

B.    The existence of such conditions as described in this chapter is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city and contributes substantially and increasingly to the deterioration and blight of residential neighborhoods, commercial areas and industrial areas.

C.    The city council finds and declares that the increase of graffiti on public and private buildings, structures, playgrounds, buses, signs, and in other places, creates a condition of blight within the city, which can result in the deterioration of property values, business opportunities, and the enjoyment of life for persons using adjacent and surrounding property, all to the detriment of the city. The city council finds that graffiti is inconsistent with the city’s property maintenance goals, crime prevention programs, and esthetic standards. It is a public nuisance which serves as an invitation for repeated trespasses and vandalism and therefore must be abated to avoid the detrimental impact of such graffiti on the city and to prevent and control the application of graffiti on property within the city.

D.    Abatement of these conditions is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city because maximum use and enjoyment of properties closely proximate to one another depends upon maintenance of those properties at or above a minimum standard of sightliness. The beneficial effects of maintaining a minimum standard of sightliness for property in the city include, but are not limited to, appreciation of property values, physical improvement of residential and commercial areas, attraction of investors of capital to residential and commercial zones, increase in commercial trade, and maximum use of property for its highest and best use.

E.    This chapter shall apply to all publicly owned property in the city, including city property, to the extent allowed by law.

F.    It is the intent of this chapter that determinations as to violations of building or construction standards and regulations shall be made by the building official, chief building inspector, public works division manager, or designees. Whenever in this chapter a duty or responsibility is imposed upon a code enforcement officer, such duty or responsibility may be performed by the code enforcement officer or his or her designee. For the purposes of this chapter, “code enforcement officers” shall be deemed to include building inspectors. (Ord. 95-003 (part), 1995)

8.02.020 Unlawful public nuisances.
It shall be unlawful and a public nuisance for any person owning, occupying, leasing or having charge or possession of any property in the city to maintain or allow to be maintained on such property the conditions set forth in this section. For the purposes of this chapter, “property” means any lot or parcel of land, including any alley, sidewalk or parkway abutting such lot or parcel of land.

A.    The exterior accumulation of weeds, dirt, litter, rubbish or debris on the property which is visible from a public street, sidewalk or right of way. Chapter 8.20 of the municipal code will apply in situations where weeds and rubbish on private property are not necessarily visible to public view.

B.    Broken, abandoned or discarded furniture or other household equipment or fixtures, packing boxes, lumber, junk, trash, rubbish, or other materials or debris, which are visible from the public street, sidewalk or right of way, including the dumping, spillage or storage of solids or liquids which may negatively impact the visual or olfactory nature of the area. “Junk” means any cast-off, damaged, discarded, obsolete, salvaged, scrapped, unusable, worn-out or wrecked object, thing or material.

C.    Buildings, fences or other structures, the exterior walls or windows of which, visible from a public street, sidewalk or right of way, contain graffiti or other inscribed material or which are cracked, broken, leaning, fallen, decayed, deteriorated or defaced, including, but not limited to, unpainted or untreated exterior wood surfaces (other than natural decay-resistant wood(s)) on any building (or any portion thereof), or structure in which the condition of the paint has become so deteriorated as to permit decay, excessive checking, cracking, peeling, chalking, dry rot, warping, or insect infestation. “Graffiti or other inscribed material” means any unauthorized inscription, word, figure or design that is written, marked, etched, scratched, drawn or painted on any real or personal property regardless of its content or nature of the material used in the commission of the act.

D.    Neglected or improperly maintained landscaping, visible from a public street, sidewalk or right of way, including but not limited to dead, debris leaden, weed infested or overgrown vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, hedges, grass and ground covers, or vegetation dying as a result of physical damage, disease, insect infestation or lack of water, or the removal or failure to maintain in good condition any landscaping required as a condition to any permit or development approval or included in the project plans or application, without city approval; provided however, that the provision as to dead or dying vegetation due to lack of water shall not be enforced during a drought year, as determined by the city. For purposes of this subdivision, a lawn area shall be deemed overgrown if fifty percent or more of its area exceeds twelve inches in height. It is the intent of the city to enforce this subdivision against those properties with open and notorious unlawful conditions, as provided herein.

E.    Storage or maintenance in a residential zone, visible from a public street, sidewalk or right of way, of metal storage bins or containers.

F.    Where visible from a public street, sidewalk or right of way, the exterior storage or maintenance of unregistered, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, automotive engines, parts, or machinery of any type or description unless specifically authorized by city license or permit; building materials or merchandise unless specifically authorized by use permit; or construction equipment or garbage bins except while excavation, construction or demolition operations covered by an active building permit or other city permit are in progress on the subject or adjoining property.

G.    The parking or storage of any vehicle, boat, trailer, camper, motor home or other mobile equipment, whether or not motorized, or portions thereof, including accumulation or storage of vehicle parts or other mechanical parts and components of a vehicle, boat, trailer, camper, or motor home, on property used or zoned for residential purposes, on any front lawn, front yard, side yard or rear yard, where visible from the public right-of-way; provided, however, that such parking or storage of a legally registered and operable vehicle, boat, trailer, camper, or motor home shall be allowed on required parking spaces or paved driveways leading directly from approved and permitted curb cuts to required garages, carports or other required off-street parking spaces, if such vehicle, boat, trailer, camper or motor home is located totally within private property and does not extend or block any public right-of-way. The parking or storage of any vehicle, boat, trailer, camper, motor home or other mobile equipment on paved areas located in the front yard or side yard other than the required driveways leading directly to garages, carports or other required off-street parking areas, or in the rear yard where visible from the public right-of-way, shall be prohibited. It shall also be prohibited, and a public nuisance, to park any vehicle on any privately owned property if such vehicle would be considered overweight and not allowed to drive on the street or highway from which such property is accessed, pursuant to Sections 10.12.150, 10.04.110 and/or 10.04.120.

H.    Land, the topography, geology or configuration of which, whether in natural state or as a result of grading operations, excavation or fill, causes erosion, subsidence, or surface water drainage problems of such magnitude as to be injurious or potentially injurious to the public health, safety and welfare or to adjacent properties.

I.    Once commenced, the failure by private property owners to complete, within a reasonable period of time, exterior physical improvements, visible from the public right-of-way, such as streets, curbs, gutters and other improvements whether or not intended to be dedicated to the city.

J.    Obstruction or encroachment upon any public property, including but not limited to any public street, sidewalk, highway, right-of-way, park or building, without a valid permit. Such obstructions or encroachments include, but are not limited to overgrown trees and shrubs; building materials; merchandise or other personal property; and buildings or portions of buildings or structures protruding onto public property.

K.    Use of property in a residential district for the purpose of performing auto repair for profit is prohibited. Auto repair including work on any vehicle, boat, trailer, camper, motor home or other mobile equipment, whether or not motorized, may be allowed only in accordance with the provisions of Municipal Code Section 5.20.150. In no instance shall more than two permits be issued and active at any one time for any property located in a residentially zoned district. All such auto repair shall only be allowed on or in the approved driveway, garage, carport or other required off-street parking space.

L.    Any condition recognized in law or in equity as constituting a public nuisance.

M.    Any condition constituting a “substandard building” under Section 17920.3 of the California Health and Safety Code.

N.    The existence of any property condition which is unlawful or declared to be a public nuisance pursuant to any other provision in the San Pablo Municipal Code. This subsection shall be construed to place an affirmative duty on property owners and occupants to maintain their property in conformity with all applicable codes. The city shall have the power to require property owners and occupants to bring their property into compliance with applicable codes, regardless of whether the building is occupied.

O.    Cultivation of Marijuana. No person owning, renting, leasing, occupying, or having charge or possession of any parcel shall cause or allow such parcel to be used for the outdoor cultivation of marijuana, the indoor cultivation of marijuana not in compliance with Section 17.62.130(C), any commercial cultivation of marijuana as defined in Section 17.62.130, and any medical marijuana facility as defined in Section 17.62.130. Violations of this provision shall be considered a public nuisance, and may be enforced according to the procedures set forth in this chapter and Chapter 1.10, and by the enforcement remedies conferred upon the city by Civil Code Section 3494, Code of Civil Procedure Section 731, Government Code Section 38773, or any other lawful authority, civil, administrative or criminal. Nothing in this provision is intended to impair any viable legal defense to state charges to a person using or in possession of medical marijuana pursuant to the Compassionate Use Act (California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 et seq.). (Ord. 2017-005 § 7, 2017; Ord. 2014-008 § 2, 2014; Ord. 02-006 § 2, 2002; Ord. 96-006 § 1, 1996; Ord. 95-003 (part), 1995) (Ord. No. 2009-001, § 2, 4-20-09)

8.02.030 Nonexclusive procedure.
A.    Any condition found to constitute a public nuisance may be abated pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter. The procedures set forth herein constitute an alternative procedure and shall not limit or restrict the city from the civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement of this or other city ordinances or regulations or abating public nuisances in any other manner provided by law.

B.    Any person violating or causing the violation of this chapter shall be guilty of an infraction as provided for in San Pablo Municipal Code Section 1.08.010, in addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter or under applicable law.

C.    Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two-year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a condition that may be abated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the court may order the owner to pay treble the costs of the abatement, as authorized by Government Code Section 38773.7. (Ord. 95-003 (part), 1995)

8.02.040 Summary abatement.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, whenever it is determined that a public nuisance is so imminently dangerous to life or adjacent property that such condition must be immediately corrected or isolated, the code enforcement officer may institute the following procedures:

A.    Notice. The code enforcement officer shall attempt to make contact through a personal interview, or by telephone, with the landowner or the person, if any, occupying or otherwise in real or apparent charge and control thereof. In the event contact is made, he or she shall notify such person or persons of the danger involved and require that such condition be immediately removed, repaired or isolated so as to preclude harm to any person or property.

B.    Abatement. In the event the code enforcement officer is unable to make contact as hereinabove noted, or if the appropriate persons, after notification by the code enforcement officer, do not take action as specified by such official, within seventy-two hours, or a lesser period if deemed necessary, then the code enforcement officer may, with the approval of the city manager, take all steps deemed necessary to remove or isolate such dangerous condition, or conditions, with the use of city forces or a contractor retained pursuant to the provisions of this code.

C.    Costs. The code enforcement officer shall keep an itemized account of the costs incurred by the city in removing or isolating such condition or conditions. Such costs may be recovered to the same extent and in the same manner that abatement costs are recovered pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 95-003 (part), 1995)

8.02.050 Notice to abate.
A.    Whenever it is determined that any property within the city is being maintained contrary to one or more of the provisions of this chapter, thirty days’ written notice to abate such condition shall be given to the owner of such property. A shorter period of time may be given if deemed necessary to prevent or remedy an immediate threat to the health and safety of the public or occupants of the structure. The notice to abate need take no particular form so long as it adequately advises the recipient that violations have been noted on the property which he or she is responsible for abating.

B.    Service shall be deemed complete at the time notice is personally served or deposited in the mail. All notices or orders shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the property address and to the owner and other responsible persons at the address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll of the county. The address of owners shown on the assessment roll shall be conclusively deemed to be the proper address for the purpose of mailing such notice. Failure of any person to receive notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken hereunder.

C.    Upon receipt of a written request from any person required to comply with the order, and for good cause shown, the code enforcement officer may grant extensions of time within which to complete the abatement, if the code enforcement officer determines that such time extensions will not create or perpetuate a situation imminently dangerous to life or property. The code enforcement officer shall have the authority to place reasonable restrictions on any such extensions. (Ord. 05-010 § 1, 2005; Ord. 95-003 (part), 1995)

8.02.060 Tenant notification.
Tenants in a residential building shall be provided notice of any notice served under this chapter, concerning any violation which affects the health and safety of the occupants and which violates Section 1941.1 of the Civil Code, an order of the code enforcement agency issued after inspection of the premises declaring the dwelling to be substandard, the enforcement agency’s decision to repair or demolish, or the issuance of a building or demolition permit following the abatement order of the enforcement agency. The notice may be provided either by first class mail to each affected residential unit, or by posting a copy of the notice in a prominent place on the affected residential unit at the discretion of the enforcement agency. (Ord. 95-003 (part), 1995)

8.02.070 Notice of hearing on abatement of nuisance.
A.    In the event the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to abate, the code enforcement officer may direct such person to abate such conditions or appear before a Hearing Officer, at a stated time and place, not less than seven (7) days from the date of the notice, to show cause why such conditions should not be abated by the City at such person’s expense. The hearing may be continued for good cause. Written notice of such continuance shall be served in the same manner as the Notice of Hearing on Abatement of Nuisance.

B.    Form of Notice. Notice shall be in substantially the following form:

The Code Enforcement Officer shall file a copy of the notice with the hearing officer together with an affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury stating the time and manner in which such notice was given and posted.

8.02.080 Hearing officer.
The hearing to determine whether a nuisance exists shall be conducted by the city manager or designee, who shall act as the hearing officer. The hearing officer is authorized to take testimony and in the course of so doing is authorized to administer oaths or affirmations pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2093(e).

(Ord. 2015-007 § 1: Ord. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.090 Conduct of hearing.
If required by the Uniform Housing Code or Uniform Construction Codes adopted pursuant to Chapter 15.04, the hearing shall be conducted in substantial compliance with requirements contained in Chapter 13, or the successor provisions to that chapter, of the most recent edition of the Uniform Housing Code. All other hearings conducted under this chapter shall allow the code enforcement officer and the party appealing to be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence concerning the property, but the hearing shall be conducted informally and the legal rules of evidence need not be followed. (Ord. 2015-007 § 2: Ord. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.100 Waiver of abatement hearing.
Failure of the owner or responsible party to appear at the hearing after notice has been served shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and an admission by such owner or responsible party of the existence of the nuisance conditions charged. In the event of such failure to appear, the hearing officer may order that the nuisance conditions be abated by the city. Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, there shall be no right to appeal such order. (Ord. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.110 Order of abatement.
Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine whether the activity or the premises, or any part thereof, as maintained, constitutes a public nuisance. If the hearing officer finds a nuisance does not exist, he or she shall dismiss the proceedings. If the hearing officer finds that a public nuisance does exist and that there is sufficient cause to order the abatement of the public nuisance, the hearing officer shall issue an Order Of Abatement, which shall direct and order the nuisance abated within the time, and in the manner set forth in the Order. The Order shall include notification of the right to appeal and shall be served in the manner set forth in Section 8.02.050(c). (Ord. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.120 Appeal procedure.
The hearing officer’s decision may be appealed by filing with the City Manager within seven (7) days from the date of service of such decision, a written, dated appeal containing:

1.    A specific identification of the property which is the subject of the nuisance abatement proceeding.

2.    A caption reading: “Appeal of ________” giving the names of all appellants participating in the appeal.

3.    A brief statement setting forth the legal interest of each of the appellants in the building or the land involved in the notice and order.

4.    A statement in ordinary and concise language of the specific order or action protested, together with any material facts supporting the contentions of the appellant.

5.    The signatures of all parties named as appellants and their official mailing addresses.

6.    The verification of at least one appellant as to the truth of the matter stated in the appeal.

An appeal shall be deemed filed upon receipt by the City Manager’s office. The City Manager shall set a date in which he or his designee shall hear the appeal, which shall not be less than seven (7) days from the date the appeal was filed. Written notice of the time and place of the appeal hearing shall be given at least five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing to each appellant, either by causing a copy of such notice to be delivered to the appellant personally or by mailing a copy thereof, postage prepaid, registered or certified, addressed to the appellant at his address shown on the appeal. Service is complete at the time of such deposit. Continuances of the hearing may be granted for good cause.

A failure to file such appeal shall be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and shall act as a bar to any legal proceeding challenging City abatement of the public nuisance. (Ord. No. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.130 Appeal hearing.
At the time of the appeal hearing the city manager or designee shall permit any interested person to present written or oral arguments relating to the appeal. The hearing shall be conducted de novo. Thereafter, based upon the administrative record, the evidence and testimony that may be presented pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and the written or oral arguments of interested persons, the city manager or designee shall determine whether the property, in its then condition, constitutes a public nuisance within the meaning of this chapter. If the city manager or designee finds a public nuisance exists, he or she shall issue an order of abatement requiring the abatement thereof. If the city manager finds such conditions to not exist, he or she shall dismiss the proceeding. The order of abatement shall take the form of a written decision briefly setting forth the findings of fact relied upon in making the order.

The decision of the city manager shall be final and conclusive. The decision shall be served in the manner set forth in Section 8.02.070(C). The decision shall include notification that, pursuant to Section 8.02.140, any action to review said decision shall be commenced not later than the thirtieth day after the date the order is issued. (Ord. 2012-002 § 1, 2012: Ord. No. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.140 Limitation of Filing Judicial Action.
Any action appealing the City Manager’s decision and order, or the City Council’s decision confirming the costs of abatement pursuant to Section 8.02.160, shall be commenced within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of service of such decision. Otherwise all objections to such decisions shall be deemed waived. (Ord. No. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.150 Abatement by City.
A.    If the nuisance is not completely abated by the owner in the time and manner set forth in the order of abatement, the nuisance shall be abated by City forces or private contract; entry upon the premises to which such order relates is expressly authorized for such purposes. No person shall obstruct, impede or interfere with any officer, employee, contractor or authorized representative of the City whenever such person is engaged in the work of abatement, or in performing any necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work, as authorized or directed pursuant to this chapter. The cost, including incidental expenses, of abating the nuisance shall become a civil debt of the owner and other responsible persons and shall be billed to the owner and become due and payable fifteen (15) days thereafter. The term “incidental expenses” shall include, but not be limited to, personnel costs, both direct and indirect; attorney’s fees; costs incurred in documenting the nuisance; the actual expenses and costs of the City in the preparation of notices, specifications, and contracts and in inspecting the work; the costs of printing and mailing the notices required hereunder; and any administrative or recording costs charged by the County.

B.    In the event that the owner or occupant fails to consent to the City entering his or her property for the purposes of inspecting and/or abating a nuisance under this chapter, the City may, if legally required, apply and be granted a court warrant if cause exists, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1822.52 or any other authority. (Ord. No. 95-003, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.02.160 Lien Procedure.
A.    Record of Cost of Abatement. The Code Enforcement Officer or authorized representative shall keep an itemized account of the costs incurred by the City in the abatement of any public nuisance under this chapter.

8.05.010 Findings.
The city council finds and determines that:

A.    Some rental units in San Pablo have severe code violations which threaten the life and safety of occupants and require the units or rooms to be vacated to allow for extensive repair.

B.    Such code violations are often caused by deferred maintenance, may breach the landlord’s implied warranty of habitability and sometimes constitute constructive eviction of the tenant household from its residence.

C.    Tenants of substandard residential units or structures suffer financial and other hardship when required to vacate their housing because the owner fails to correct the substandard conditions.

D.    It is appropriate to require the owner to mitigate partially the tenant’s hardship since the hardship arises from the owner’s failure to comply with the law and fulfill a landlord’s obligations to the landlord’s tenants.

E.    Financial hardship arises because the tenant generally needs a large sum of money to relocate, often including first and last month’s rent, deposits, moving expenses and utility deposits for a new residence. Low-income tenants are generally unable to obtain such sums and, as a result, are at great risk of becoming homeless.

F.    The level of payments provided in this chapter is reflective of actual relocation costs likely to be incurred by displaced households.

G.    Delayed payment of relocation benefits may impose extreme hardship upon tenants who then must themselves obtain the large sums necessary to relocate. Delayed payment may also require the city to expend city general funds to provide tenants with financial assistance for relocation. Any requirement to pay relocation benefits should contain disincentives for delayed payment in the form of appropriate penalties.

H.    This chapter is adopted pursuant to Article 31, Chapter 6.1 of the California Health and Safety Code, commencing at Section 50651. (Ord. 04-011 § 1 (part), 2004)

8.05.020 Definitions.

Residential unit or structure shall include mobile homes located in mobile home parks, provided that the city has assumed enforcement authority over such parks from the State Department of Housing and Community Development.

“Tenant” means any resident of the affected property who is a tenant as that term is used in Chapter 2 of Title 5 of Part 4 of the California Civil Code (Section 1940, et seq.)

The building official or designee shall attempt to provide telephonic or written notice to the owner that benefits are payable immediately. Failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the owner of any obligations imposed by this chapter.

C.    Relocation benefits shall be payable immediately in cases in which the conditions on the premises require the building official or designee to order the premises vacated immediately. In such cases the building official shall attempt to provide telephonic or written notice to the owner to notify the owner that benefits are payable immediately. Failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the owner of any obligations imposed by this chapter.

8.05.070 When relocation benefits not payable.
A.    No relocation benefits shall be payable by the owner to any tenant if such tenant or his or her guest or invitee has caused or substantially contributed to the condition giving rise to the order to vacate, as determined by the building official or designee.

B.    No relocation benefits shall be payable by the owner if the building official or designee determines that the unit or structure became unsafe or hazardous during the tenancy (and no more than six months prior to the order to vacate) as a result of earthquake, flood, fire, act of the public enemy or other disaster not proximately caused by building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical or fire code violations. (Ord. 04-011 § 1 (part), 2004)

8.05.080 Payment of relocation costs by city.
A.    In the event the owner fails, neglects or refuses to pay a displaced tenant relocation benefits as required by this chapter, the city may, within budgetary limitations, make payment of such relocation benefits as the building official or designee determines is necessary to assist the displaced tenant to relocate, up to the amount payable by the owner under Section 8.05.050 of this chapter.

There is no right to appeal the city manager’s decision.

B.    The city may recover from the owner any amount paid to a tenant pursuant to this chapter. This city shall also be entitled to recover from the owner an additional amount, not to exceed ten thousand dollars, equal to one-half the amount so paid as a penalty for failure to make timely payment to the displaced tenant. The city shall also be entitled to recover from owner its actual costs (including direct and indirect costs) of administering the provision of benefits to the displaced tenant.

C.    Any amount paid by the city and any applicable penalties and administrative costs shall be a personal obligation of the owner and shall be placed as a lien against the property and recorded with the county recorder.

D.    Nothing contained in this chapter shall require the city to pay any relocation benefits to any tenant, or to assume any obligation, requirement, or duty of the owner pursuant to this chapter.

E.    The damages which a displaced tenant may receive under Section 8.05.060 of this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any benefits received from the city. (Ord. 04-011 § 1 (part), 2004)

8.05.090 Recovery of relocation costs by city—Notice, hearing, appeal.
A.    Prior to instituting any action to collect relocation payments from the owner or to impose a lien therefore, where the city has advanced relocation payments to displaced tenants when the owner or designated agent fails to do so, the building official or designee shall send to the owner by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at the owner’s address as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, an itemized accounting of all benefits paid by the city to the owner’s tenants, and any penalties or costs the city is seeking to recover.

A.    Every owner of any place or premises shall subscribe for and pay the contractor for service for the collection and disposal of solid waste at such rates or collection charges that are prescribed by the city council and shall bear the responsibility for payment of the charges. In the case of any leased or rented single-family dwelling house, apartment, flat, duplex, four-plex or other multifamily dwelling, the owner shall subscribe to such collection and disposal service for each occupied dwelling unit therein and shall directly bear the responsibility for payment of the charges for such collection and disposal services.

B.    The owner shall start service within seven days of occupancy of a premises. If the owner fails to start service the building official of the city, or designate, shall give the owner written notification that such service is required. If service is not initiated within fifteen days from the date of mailing of the notice, then the building official of the city, or designate, shall require the contractor to initiate and continue service for the owner.

E.    If any owner fails to pay the contractor for collection service for a five-month period or for any period when collection service is stopped, the contractor shall mail the owner a final request for payment for the amounts owed, plus penalties including the charge for service to the end of the owner’s most recent billing period, which may include the month during which the notice is mailed. The final request shall include a warning notice that if the service charges are not paid within thirty days, they will be turned over to the city for placement on the tax rolls. The warning notice shall include information concerning the additional administrative charges that will become due if a lien is recorded against the property, and that the city shall assess the property on the next property tax statement if the charges plus penalties are not paid in full.

The final request for payment shall be mailed to each owner that appears as the owner of the property for which the service was provided on the most recent property assessment rolls of the county assessor.

F.    Upon receipt of a verified complaint, the director of finance shall set a time and place for an administrative hearing before the director of finance. The director of finance shall cause notice of this hearing to be mailed to each person to whom the described property for which the service is rendered is assessed on the most recent property assessment rolls of the county assessor. The written notice of the hearing shall be mailed not less than fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing.

G.    If the director of finance approves the delinquent charges against the owner of the property, a lien on the real property for which the service was rendered will be recorded with the recorder of the county. The recorded lien shall carry an additional administrative charge of twenty-five dollars or ten percent of the amount owed, whichever is greater.

1.    Delinquent charges which remain unpaid by the owner shall constitute a special assessment against the property to which the service was rendered and shall be collected at such time as established by the county assessor for inclusion in the next property tax assessment.

2.    The director of finance shall turn over to the county assessor for inclusion in the next property tax assessment the total sum of unpaid delinquent charges plus penalties for garbage collection service and administrative charges, plus an assessment charge of five dollars as a special assessment against the parcel or parcels of property situated within the city to which the service was rendered. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected. The assessment shall be subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously imposed on the property. It shall have priority over other liens except for those state, county and municipal taxes with which it shall have parity. The lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest and charges due and payable thereon are paid. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes are applicable to the special assessment. (Ord. 86-010 § 1, 1986; Ord. 83-006 § 2 (part), 1983)

In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the city council makes the following findings and declarations: The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly permitted in subsection A of Section 8.16.030, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Code Enforcement Officer

B.    The Notice of Intention is not required for removal of a vehicle or part thereof that is inoperable due to the absence of a motor, transmission, or wheels and incapable of being towed, is valued at less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) by a person specified in Section 22855 of the California Vehicle Code, and is determined by the City to be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public health or safety, provided that the property owner has signed a release authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. Prior to final disposition under Vehicle Code Section 22662 of such a low valued vehicle or part for which evidence of registration was recovered, the City shall provide notice to the registered and legal owners of intent to dispose of the vehicle or part, and if the vehicle or part is not claimed and removed within twelve (12) days after the notice is mailed, from a location specified in Vehicle Code Section 22662, final disposition may proceed. Neither the City nor contractor thereof shall be liable for damage caused to a vehicle or part thereof by removal pursuant to this section. This subdivision applies only to inoperable vehicles located upon a parcel that is 1) zoned for agricultural use or 2) not improved with a residential structure containing one or more dwelling units. (Ord. No. 95-005, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.16.090 Abatement—Hearing—Procedure.
A.    Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or owner of the land received by the Code Enforcement Officer within ten days after the mailing of the notices of intention to abate and remove, a public hearing shall be held on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle, or parts thereof, as an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, and the assessment of the administrative costs and the cost of removal of the vehicle, or parts thereof, against the property on which it is located.

B.    If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such ten-day period, said statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require his or her presence. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, by registered or certified mail, at least ten days before the hearing to the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. If such a request for hearing is not received within said ten days after mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove, the city shall have the authority to abate and remove the vehicle, or parts thereof, as a public nuisance without holding a public hearing. (Ord. No. 95-005, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.16.100 Abatement—Hearing—Action.
A.    All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the Chief of Police or designees, who are hereby designated as the City’s Vehicle Abatement Commissioners and Hearing Officers. The hearing officer shall hear all facts and testimony he or she deems pertinent. Said facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle, or parts thereof, and the circumstances concerning its location on the property. The hearing officer shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his or her reasons for such denial.

B.    The hearing officer may impose such conditions and take such other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purposes of this chapter, and may delay the time for removal of the vehicles, or parts thereof, if in his or her opinion the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the hearing officer may find that a vehicle, or parts thereof, has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as provided in Section 8.16.120 and determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle, or parts thereof, and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle if available at the site. In the event the Order fails to assess such costs, an invoice may be mailed to such owner following abatement by the City.

C.    If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he or she has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the hearing officer shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such owner of the land.

D.    If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land but does not appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the hearing officer but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing of the decision. (Ord. No. 95-005, Enacted, 04/17/95)

C.    The city manager shall give written notice of the time and place of the hearing to the appellant and those persons specified in Section 8.16.080.

D.    In conducting the hearing, the city manager shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. (Ord. No. 95-005, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.16.120 Removal of vehicles—Reconstruction restricted—Final disposition.
A.    In the absence of a request for a hearing, or following a final hearing and decision by the City, the City may abate the public nuisance by removal of the vehicle to a scrapyard, automobile dismantler’s yard, or other final disposition. A court warrant shall first be obtained if required by law. At the time of removal, the officer or employee shall determine the amount of mileage on the vehicle.

B.    After a vehicle has been removed, it shall not be reconstructed or made operable unless it is a vehicle that qualifies for either horseless carriage license plates or historical vehicle license plates pursuant to Section 5004 of the California Vehicle Code, in which case the vehicle may be reconstructed or made operable. (Ord. No. 95-005, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.16.130 Determination of value.
For lien sale purposes, the City shall determine if the estimated value of the vehicle is three hundred dollars ($300) or less, over three hundred dollars but two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or less, or over two thousand five hundred dollars. In the event the City fails or refuses to estimate value, such value shall be estimated by the garage keeper or agent as specified in Vehicle Code Sections 22851 and 22670. (Ord. No. 95-005, Enacted, 04/17/95)

8.16.140 Removal of vehicles—Notification.

2.    Prepare and give to the lienholder a report which includes all of the following:

a.    The value of the vehicle estimated pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 22670.

b.    The identification of the estimator.

c.    The location of the vehicle.

d.    A description of the vehicle, including the make, year, model, identification number, license number, state of registration, and, if a motorcycle, an engine number.

e.    The statutory authority for storage.

9.04.010 Findings and purpose.
The operation of gaming clubs within the state in strict compliance with its gaming laws has been demonstrated to be a successful means of generating revenues for local governments. It is found and determined that, with the city’s present population, one gaming club, in which only those games permitted under the laws of California are played, if authorized by the city council, shall be allowed in the city for the purpose of creating new jobs and new revenue for the San Pablo community.

It is found that the public health, safety and welfare require the establishment of regulations pursuant to, and in conformity with, the State Gambling Control Act. The city finds it necessary to regulate, among other things:

A.    The persons who will own, operate or be employed in gaming clubs.

B.    The number and size of gaming clubs in the city.

C.    The operation of gaming clubs in the city.

D.    The issuance of permits and licenses, including limitations on transfer and assignment, for gaming clubs. (Ord. 98-002 § 1 (part), 1998; Ord. 94-001 (part), 1994)

This reservation includes but is not limited to the right of the city to enact or amend rules and regulations, and to amend, from time to time, a license issued pursuant to the terms of this chapter, by resolution of the city council. The issuance of any such license shall not be deemed a waiver by the city of such right or power to amend such license or the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 94-001 (part), 1994)

9.04.040 Licenses—Required.

This chapter regulates the owners of the gaming club, and not the land upon which it is located. Under no circumstances shall any conditions attached to any such license be construed to turn such license into a conditional use permit whose transfer may not be restricted by the city. It is unlawful for any person to bet at, or against, any card game except as allowed by this chapter.

B.    No application for a license for the conduct of any game and/or business under this chapter shall be received, filed or processed by the city manager, nor shall a public hearing on the same be conducted:

2.    When the application contemplates less than thirty licensed tables or units, or an aggregate size or area under one roof of less than thirty thousand square feet; or

3.    During the term of any exclusive application agreement between the city and any other applicant.

C.    The city council may regulate the terms and conditions for operation of a gaming club, including but not limited to permissible hours of operation of such gaming clubs, the games to be played, and wagering limits, through resolution or the imposition of conditions of approval attached to the issuance of a license under this chapter, or to the issuance of a use permit as may otherwise be required under this code. No-limit and high-limit bets will be allowed in designated high-limit game areas and during authorized tournaments. In no other case shall individual bets higher than three hundred dollars be allowed in poker games, nor bets higher than five hundred dollars be allowed in California games. (Ord. 96-002 § 1, 1996; Ord. 95-008 §§ 2, 3, 1995; Ord. 94-001 (part), 1994)

In no event shall the number of licensed gaming tables in the city exceed five hundred.

9.04.080 Business license taxes.
A.    Imposition of Business License Taxes. It is unlawful for any person issued a license pursuant to this chapter to operate a gaming club without paying the business license taxes hereinafter prescribed. The business license taxes imposed herein are intended for revenue only and are not regulatory fees for the cost of administering the provisions of this chapter. They shall be general taxes deposited in the city’s general fund. The amount of business license taxes received by the city under this section shall be a public record.

1.    The license tax shall be paid monthly to the city. Payment for any calendar month shall be made on or before the tenth day of the succeeding calendar month. The sum of twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars shall be paid to the city when the license is issued, which sum shall be applied against the monthly license tax due for the first month of operation. This advance payment shall be the absolute property of the city and shall not be refunded or prorated for any reason.

B.    Business License Tax: Amount.

1.    Commencing on the first day of operation, licensee shall pay to the city a monthly business license tax as set forth below; provided, however, that regardless of the total monthly gross revenue, the minimum monthly tax shall be at least $91,500: (a) Total monthly gross revenue of First $0 to $1,000,000 shall pay a monthly tax of 10.0% plus $7,500; (b) Total monthly gross revenue of Next $1,000,001 to $2,000,000 shall pay a monthly tax of 12.5%; (c) Over $2,000,000 shall pay a monthly tax of 15.0%.

2.    Following the first twelve months of operation, the same tax rate shall apply; provided, however, that regardless of the total monthly gross revenue, the minimum monthly tax shall be at least ninety-one thousand five hundred dollars.

3.    Should any tournament be held, ten percent of the total entry fees shall be included in addition to the total monthly tax specified above.

4.    For any nongaming business operations on the premises, including but not limited to food and beverage service or rental of facilities, licensee shall pay to city a monthly business license tax as set forth in Section 5.04.220, as it may be adjusted or amended, for fixed places of business, or as set forth in any more applicable section, as determined by the finance director. All procedures set forth in Title 5 Chapter 4 of the San Pablo Municipal Code relating to business licenses shall be applicable to such nongaming operations.

C.    Statement of Revenue. Each licensee shall file with the city before the tenth day of each calendar month a reporting form approved by the city manager, under penalty of perjury, showing the true and correct amount of gross revenue derived from the gaming club for the preceding calendar month. Such statement shall be accompanied by the payment of the correct amount of taxes due and owing in accordance with the provisions of subsection B of this section. Such sums correctly reflecting the monthly fees payable for the preceding month shall be accepted by the city; subject, however, to the future right of the city to audit the matters referred to in any such statement and to determine the correctness of the figures and the amounts payable to the city pursuant to the provisions of subsection B of this section.

D.    Audit of Reports.

1.    Licensee shall arrange for a certified public accountant approved by the city manager to audit the books, documents, records and accounts relating to the gross revenues of the licensee at the end of the licensee’s fiscal year. The report of such accountant and all work papers utilized in the preparation of such audit shall be submitted to the city manager. The city manager, or his designee, shall review the report and work papers and may require any further information from the licensee. The city manager may submit such documents and information to a certified public accountant for review.

2.    In addition to the audit required above, the books, records, and accounts of any gaming club may be audited by the city at any time. Upon request of the auditor, licensee shall provide to the auditor copies of licensee’s state and federal income tax returns, which shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed other than as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. In the event a city conducted audit discloses an underpayment in excess of two percent in any one month, the full cost of the audit shall be borne by the licensee. Any information obtained pursuant to the provisions of this section or any statement filed by the licensee shall be deemed confidential and shall not be subject to public inspection except in connection with the enforcement or administration of the provisions of this chapter, or as may be required by the California Public Records Act.

E.    Refusal to File, Pay Fees or Taxes or Permit Inspection of Records. Any failure or refusal of such licensee to timely make and file any required statements, or to pay such fees or taxes when the same are due and payable in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or to permit inspections of such books, records, and accounts of such licensee, shall constitute full and sufficient grounds to revoke or suspend the license.

F.    Delinquent Business License Taxes—Penalties; Interest. Penalties for late payment shall be assessed in accordance with Section 5.04.210 of this Code.

G.    Business License Tax a Debt—Attorneys’ Fees. The amount of any business license tax, penalties and interest imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a civil debt to the city.

H.    Business License Taxes Not Refundable. In the event of the cessation of business by a licensee, whether voluntary or involuntary, no refund of any tax shall be made. (Ord. 98-002 § 3, 1998; Ord. 94-014, enacted 1/3/95; Ord. 94-001 (part), 1994)

9.04.090 Licenses—Conditions.
A.    All licenses granted by the city council shall be deemed conditioned so as to require compliance with all of the terms, conditions and provisions of this chapter as well as all applicable laws of the city, state and federal governments. No license shall be valid unless the licensee obtains and maintains a valid and current registration from the Attorney General pursuant to the Gambling Control Act. By applying for a license, the applicant agrees to a condition in the license granted that the licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city and redevelopment agency, its officers and employees, from any and all claims, actions, judgments and damages, including but not limited to award of attorney fees, against the city and agency, its officers or employees, directly or indirectly related to issuance or validity of such license or any other permit required by law, or to the exercise of city’s Public Records Act discretion under this chapter or to the enforcement of Section 9.04.050. In addition to the above, the city council may impose specific conditions upon the license or other required permits which, in its discretion, it deems necessary to ensure compliance with provisions of this chapter and to protect the health, safety and welfare of employees, patrons, and the residents of the city.

B.    A violation of any condition of any license or other permit is hereby deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter and is deemed sufficient grounds for license revocation or suspension, imposition of fines, or other action determined appropriate by the city council. All terms and conditions specified in any license shall be enforceable as if set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 98-002 § 1 (part), 1998; Ord. 94-001 (part), 1994)

9.04.110 Granting and denying of application.
A.    Consideration by City Council. Within forty-five days after the required reports have been submitted to the city manager, and if all required fees have been paid, the city council shall hold a public hearing on its intent to consider whether such license should be issued. The city manager shall cause to be given at least ten days published notice of such public hearing. At least ten days mailed notice shall also be given to the applicant of the time and place of such hearing; and to owners of real property within three hundred feet of the subject property as listed on the last equalized assessment roll.

B.    Decision of the City Council. The city council in its discretion, shall either approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application for a license within thirty days after close of the public hearing. In the event that any required reports are not filed within the ninety day period, the city council may continue the public hearing or may act on the application without such reports and either grant, with or without conditions, or deny the application in the sole discretion of the city council; provided, that the city council may not deny the application based solely on the lack of any such report, if its absence is not the fault of applicant. (Ord. 94-001 (part), 1994)

9.04.120 Grounds for denial of application.

The applicant has the burden of proving his or her qualifications for the permit. The issuance of a conditional or temporary permit creates no vested right to the issuance of a full city permit, and the applicant retains the burden of proving his or her qualifications for such permit. The application for a work permit shall be denied where the chief of police or designee determines that there is good cause therefor. In determining whether “good cause” exists, the chief or designee shall consider whether:

1.    The applicant has been convicted of any crime or offense within the last ten years punishable as a felony or involving moral turpitude, or has been convicted of the sale or possession for sale of a controlled substance, prostitution, pimping or pandering, or of a crime involving lotteries, gambling, larceny, perjury, bribery, extortion, fraud, theft or embezzlement, or has been convicted of any crime substantially related to the service or entertainment business;

The identity of persons who have furnished information purporting to disclose violations of the law shall be privileged and confidential upon a determination by the chief or designee that disclosure is against the public interest because the need to preserve confidentiality outweighs the need for disclosure in the interest of justice.

2.    If an application is denied, the applicant may appeal such denial by requesting city manager review, provided such request is made in writing and filed with the city manager, along with the payment of an appeal fee established city council resolution, within ten days following the effective date of the denial.

E.    Each employee, except those specifically exempted by the city manager, at all times while acting within the scope of employment, shall wear in a prominently visible place upon his or her person an identification card, permit, badge or license in such form as shall be prescribed by the chief of police. Undercover security personnel and persons issued work permits to act solely as proposition players need not wear such identification badge in a prominently visible place, but shall carry it upon their person at all times. For the purposes of this subsection, the owners of a licensed gaming club, and any director, officer, or partner of such owner, and any manager, shall be deemed to be employees.

F.    All employees working within the gaming areas of the gaming club must be at least twenty-one years of age as of the date such employment starts; prospective employees may file an application for a work permit prior to their twenty-first birthday, and a permit may be approved to be effective on such birthday.

B.    The permit shall be suspended or revoked by the police chief or designee. The chief shall send notice of such action, including the reasons therefor and the right to appeal to the city manager, to the employee and licensee. If the notice reflects the chief of police’s determination that the permittee has engaged in such conduct as to provide reasonable cause to believe that his or her continued work in a gaming club would constitute an immediate threat of continued violations under this chapter or of fraudulent or dishonest conduct, or is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, then pending final decision on the suspension or revocation, the licensee shall not allow the employee to work on the premises. The employee may appeal the suspension or revocation by filing, within ten days of the date such notice was served, a request for a hearing with the city manager. The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by payment of an appeal fee in an amount established by resolution of the city council. If no written appeal is filed with the city manager within the time allotted, and/or the appeal fee is not timely paid, the decision of the chief’ shall be final and the right to appeal shall have been waived. Failure to timely file an appeal and pay the appeal fee shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

9.05.010 Findings and purpose.
The city council finds and determines that the upcoming opening of a major gaming club in the city has presented an opportunity for the proliferation of card dealer schools which, if left unregulated, could result in serious problems to the public health, safety and welfare. It is important that the city act to regulate and license these new businesses to ensure that their owners and all instructors and employees undergo background investigations and criminal history checks, and to prohibit certain questionable business practices which such types of businesses have been known to utilize. The council finds that such card dealer schools must be regulated and licensed by the city to ensure that adequate precautions are taken that clients of such schools are not victimized, and that owners and employees of such schools do not present a threat to the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 95-009 § 1 (part), 1995)

It is unlawful for any person to commence or conduct, or purport to commence or conduct within the city any card dealer school at which a fee, commission or compensation is directly or indirectly charged, accepted or received from participants in such school, unless and until such person shall have first obtained, and maintained in full force and effect, a license to do so in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

9.05.050 License denial.
The application for a work permit shall be denied where the chief of police or designee determines that there is good cause therefor. In determining whether “good cause” exists, the chief or designee shall consider whether:

A.    The applicant has been convicted of any crime or offense within the last ten years punishable as a felony or involving moral turpitude, or has been convicted of the sale or possession for sale of a controlled substance, prostitution, pimping or pandering, or of a crime involving lotteries, gambling, larceny, perjury, bribery, extortion, fraud, theft or embezzlement, or has been convicted of any crime substantially related to the service or entertainment business;

Such request shall be made in writing and received by the city manager within ten days following the effective date of the denial.

The decision shall be effective upon date of mailing or personal service on the employee. The licensee or employee may appeal the chief’s determination by filing, within ten days of the date such notice was served, a request for a hearing with the city manager. A request for hearing shall be deemed filed upon receipt by the city manager.

9.05.120 Inspection of premises.
A.    The city council finds and determines that card dealer schools engage in transactions which directly affect the public health and safety. Such schools are part of the extensively regulated gaming industry, and are therefore highly regulated in the interests of the public, health, safety and welfare in the city. Card dealer schools are known to have engaged, and present a high risk of engaging, in the types of fraudulent or unfair practices which are prohibited by this chapter. The city has a compelling interest in maximizing employment opportunities for its residents and in protecting them from the business practices prohibited by this chapter. There exists a public perception that the gaming industry is or may be infiltrated with criminal elements or unfair or illegal practices, and the city council has a compelling interest in protecting the integrity of the city’s regulation of the gaming industry in the city, and the public’s confidence in such regulation.

B.    By applying for a license under this chapter, the applicant agrees and consents that the chief of police or designee shall have the right and authority to make unannounced, warrantless inspections, during business hours, of the premises and business documents of the licensee to ensure that the provisions of this chapter are being followed. The police department is specifically authorized only to inspect the premises and documents of licensee to determine whether the licensee or its employees have satisfied the conditions of Sections 9.05.080 and 9.05.090, and whether cause for suspension or revocation of such license is warranted under Sections 9.05.110(A) and 9.05.050(B). Licensees under this chapter shall have no expectation of privacy in the conduct of their business, and shall be deemed to have consented to such inspections. (Ord. 95-009 § 1 (part), 1995)

9.05.130 Violation of chapter.
Violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any term or condition of a license issued under this chapter, shall be a misdemeanor unless deemed an infraction by the city attorney. (Ord. 95-009 § 1 (part), 1995)

9.24.010 Findings and purpose.
This chapter shall be known as the “San Pablo special events ordinance.” This chapter establishes standards and procedures for the issuance of permits for public assemblies, parades, and other special events in the city of San Pablo. Because it is recognized that such special events enhance the lives of and provide benefits to its citizens, this chapter establishes a process for permitting special events conducted by the private sector to use city streets, parks, facilities, and/or services. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health and safety of the citizens of San Pablo, to preserve the rights of individuals to engage in expressive activity protected under the First Amendment through reasonable time, place, and manner regulation of those activities, to prohibit illegal activities from occurring at the events, to regulate competing uses of public fora, to maintain parks and streets in attractive and intact conditions, to regulate streets to protect and insure the safety, comfort or convenience of the public, to provide for the recovery of costs to the city directly flowing from these events, and to provide timely notice to the city of the need for additional public safety and other services. This chapter shall only apply to events that fall within the definitions set forth below.

This chapter generally regulates such assemblies of seventy-five or more people gathering for a common purpose, or other special events with a substantial impact on the public rights-of-way or other public spaces. The city council finds that requiring permits for such gatherings is a reasonable restriction because in a city the small size of San Pablo, approximately two and one-half square miles, with few if any large open public spaces, and a limited police and public works staff, even seventy-five or fewer people impacting the public right-of-way without sufficient prior knowledge and preparation by city staff can and will have adverse impacts upon the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city. Small public safety and public works departments can have great difficulty in quickly arranging schedules and resources to adequately deal with impacts to the public health, safety and welfare, and therefore adequate time is needed to respond to applications under this chapter. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.020 Definitions.
“Chief of police” means the chief of police or his or her authorized deputy.

“Expressive activity” means any assembly, the sole or principal object of which is the expression, dissemination, or communication by verbal, visual, literary, or auditory means of a particular opinion, view, or idea, and for which no fee or donation is charged or required as a condition of participation in or attendance at such activity. It includes public oratory and distribution of literature.

“Person” means any natural person, firm, association, joint venture, joint stock company, partnership, organization, club, company, corporation, business trust or manager, lessee, agent, servant, officer or employee of any of them, except where the context clearly requires a different meaning.

“Special event” means:

A.    Any organized formation, parade, procession, demonstration or assembly which may include persons, animals, vehicles, or any combination thereof, which is to assemble or travel in unison on any street, sidewalk or other public right-of-way owned or controlled by the city which does not comply with applicable traffic regulations, laws or controls; or

B.    Any organized assemblage of seventy-five or more persons at public open spaces in which the city needs to regulate competing uses or provide for additional public safety or other public services, or other public spaces such as sidewalks and streets, which is to gather for a common purpose under the direction or control of a person; or

C.    Any other organized activity in public open spaces or other public spaces such as sidewalks and streets involving seventy-five or more persons conducted by a person for a common or collective use, purpose or benefit which is likely to significantly interfere with the use of the public property or right-of-way or which will not comply with traffic regulations.

D.    Examples of special events include, but are not limited to, concerts, parades, circuses, fairs, festivals, block parties, street fairs, community events, mass participation sports (such as marathons and other running events), athletic or sporting events, and community celebrations and observances conducted on public property or public rights-of-way.

“Special event permit” means a permit issued under this chapter.

“Spontaneous event” means any special event for the purpose of expressive activity which is organized in response to news or affairs coming into public knowledge less than forty-eight hours prior to the assembly. Events which require advance planning such as recreation events, competition/contests/spectator sports, fairs, festivals, carnivals, ticketed events, sales/trade shows or events which require a permit from building and safety or other city or county departments for the placement of structures shall not be considered to be spontaneous events. Organizers of spontaneous events may still incur departmental service charges to the extent otherwise authorized by this chapter or any administrative regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.030 Special event permit required.
A.    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person may hold, sponsor, conduct, promote, maintain, or manage a special event unless a special event permit has been first obtained from the chief of police. The city manager is authorized to issue administrative regulations that are consistent with and that further the terms and requirements set forth within this chapter. Any such regulations shall be publicly available. Issuance of a special event permit does not obligate or require the city to provide city services, equipment or personnel in support of any special event.

B.    The chief of police is authorized to issue permits for special events occurring within the city limits pursuant to the procedures established in this chapter and is authorized to coordinate the issuance of a special event permit with other city departments and public agencies involved. The police department shall coordinate with other city departments so as to ensure timely processing of the application, and shall forward all applications to the city attorney, who shall review and advise as to the applicability of First Amendment protections. In such capacity, the city attorney shall not act as an advocate for the department but as a neutral advisor charged with protection of First Amendment rights.

C.    All applications shall be submitted with payment of a nonrefundable application fee established by resolution of city council. Any application submitted without such fee shall be deemed incomplete, except as provided in subsection D of this section. The fee shall be reasonably equivalent to the administrative cost of investigation and processing of the application. Fees and payments required under this chapter shall be in addition to any other license, permit or fee required under any other chapter of the San Pablo Municipal Code, any other city regulation, or under any other county, state or federal law or regulation.

D.    The application fee shall be waived as to an applicant who qualifies as an indigent natural person, who is eligible for county relief and support under the California Welfare and Institutions Code, and who seeks to exercise First Amendment rights by applying for a special events permit for expressive activity under this chapter. Application for indigent status shall be made at the time of permit application and shall be accompanied by such relevant information and documentation as may, in the opinion of the police chief, be reasonably necessary to verify such status. For purposes of this subsection, “indigency” includes, but is not limited to, a person eligible for county relief and support as an indigent person under the California Welfare and Institutions Code, a person receiving benefits pursuant to Supplemental Security Income and/or State Supplemental Payments, and a person receiving food stamps. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.040 Exceptions to special event permit.
A special event permit is not required for any of the following activities, although an organizer of an activity exempted pursuant to this section is required to comply with general regulations governing public safety or health:

A.    Funeral processions by a licensed mortuary; provided, however, that the mortuary shall notify the on-duty police watch commander as soon as practical if a funeral and/or procession, by the nature of death, notoriety, funeral conveyances, use of pyrotechnics or honor guard weapons, or unusually large expected attendance, may affect public safety.

B.    Activities conducted by the city acting within the scope of its authority.

C.    Spontaneous events; provided, that no fee is charged as a requirement for participation or attendance. If practicable, the organizers shall give notice to the chief of police at least four hours prior to the event informing the city of the time and duration of the event and providing an estimate of the approximate number of people attending. Unorganized gatherings are exempt from the provisions of this chapter.

D.    Any activity or event conducted by or on behalf of a public or private school, college or school district, the state of California or other governmental entity so long as the activity or event is conducted solely on property owned or leased by the entity or its sponsor and is for the benefit of the entity that owns or leases the property on which the activity takes place.

E.    Any activity or event on city-owned or controlled property for private parties or events that only require park or facility reservation permits from the community services department of the city. Events which require payment to the city to reserve park or facility space shall be processed under recreation division policies to the extent such policies are applied in a constitutional manner. The recreation division will refer any applications which potentially present First Amendment issues to the chief of police and city attorney, and where such applications are deemed to be special events for expressive activities as defined in this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall supersede any conflicting requirements in recreation division policies. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.050 Priority of special event permit issuance.
Except for events sponsored by the city, wherever possible priority shall be given for the issuance of a special event permit to local, tax-exempt, non-profit organizations operating in and providing services to the citizens of San Pablo. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.060 Time for filing application for special event permit.

1.    The event is reasonably likely to substantially interrupt public transportation or other vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area of its route.

2.    The concentration of people, animals, and vehicles is reasonably likely to substantially interfere with the movement of police, fire, ambulance, and other emergency vehicles on the streets.

3.    The event is reasonably likely to substantially interfere with any construction, maintenance, or development of a street or other public right-of-way or of a public facility scheduled to take place, or a previously granted encroachment permit.

4.    The event is reasonably likely to require the diversion of a great number of police employees from their normal duties and thereby prevent reasonable police protection to the remainder of the city.

5.    The event will interfere with any other special event for which a permit has already been granted, or will occur so close in time and place to another special event so as to cause undue traffic congestion or prevent the police department from meeting the needs of its services for both events.

6.    The proposed area for the event cannot physically accommodate the number of participants expected as represented in the application.

7.    The information contained in the permit application is found to be incomplete, false, or intentionally misleading.

8.    The applicant or the person or entity on whose behalf the application for permit was made has on prior occasions damaged city property and has not paid in full for such damage, or has other outstanding and unpaid debts to the city, or has previously had a permit revoked, in San Pablo or in another jurisdiction, for violation of permit conditions or for unlawful conduct relating thereto and it is reasonably believed that similar violations or unlawful conduct will again occur.

B.    In determining whether to approve an application, no consideration may be given to the message of the event, the content of speech, the identity or associational relationships of the applicant, or to any assumptions or predictions as to the level or nature of hostility or other reactions which may be aroused in the public by the content of speech or message conveyed by the event. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.090 Permit conditions.
The chief of police may impose reasonable time, place, and manner conditions that are necessary to coordinate multiple uses of public property, assure preservation of public property and public places, prevent dangerous, unlawful or impermissible uses, protect the safety of people and property, and provide for adequate control of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; provided, that such conditions do not unreasonably restrict the right of free speech protected by the California or United States Constitutions. The chief of police shall wherever possible consult with the city attorney prior to imposition of conditions and shall provide applicant with a written explanation for a decision that imposes conditions on a permit.

9.24.100 Action on application.
A.    Expressive Activity Events. For special events occurring within one week of the filing of the completed application, whose main purpose is expressive activity, the chief of police, following consultation with the city attorney wherever possible, shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application no later than one business day after a completed application is submitted unless the applicant agrees to extend the time for making the decision to a later date.

For such special events occurring more than week after the application is filed, but within one month, the chief of police, following consultation with the city attorney wherever possible, shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application no later than two business days after a completed application is submitted unless the applicant agrees to extend the time for making the decision to a later date.

For such special events occurring more than one month after the application is filed, the chief of police, following consultation with the city attorney wherever possible, shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application no later than ten business days after a completed application is submitted unless the applicant agrees to extend the time for making the decision to a later date.

The applicant shall be notified by telephone of the reasons for the decision within the time periods set forth above, followed by notification in writing to be deposited in first-class mail on the same day as the telephonic notice. If no telephone number is provided on the application, then mailing of the written notice as provided for herein shall be sufficient.

B.    Other Special Events. For all other special events, the chief of police shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application as expeditiously as possible and, in any case, no later than fifteen business days after the completed application is submitted unless the applicant agrees to extend the time for making the decision to a later date.

C.    If action on the permit under subsection A of this section results in a permit with conditions imposed, such conditions shall be explained on the notice of conditional approval. If the permit is denied, the notice of denial shall set forth the reasons for denial. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.110 Appeals.
A.    Any applicant aggrieved by an adverse decision on the application (Sections 9.24.080 through 9.24.100), application fee (Section 9.24.030), service charges (Section 9.24.120), insurance requirements (Section 9.24.130) or revocation/suspension of a permit (Section 9.24.150) may appeal such decision to the city manager by filing a written notice of such appeal with the city manager within five business days of the decision. The appeal shall be made by filing a written petition with the city clerk setting forth the name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; a detailed description of the specific action to be reviewed; the specific grounds for the review; and the relief or action sought. The city manager will decide the appeal within one working day. The city manager shall consult with the city attorney if practicable before denying or conditionally approving a permit involving “expressive activity” (including all proposed events which the applicant claims or contends primarily involve expressive activity) as that term is defined in this chapter. The decision shall be in writing and shall provide an explanation for the decision. Failure to file an appeal with the city manager shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies unless the applicant can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that due to timeliness or other circumstances recognized by law the filing of such appeal would be futile.

B.    The city manager’s decision may be appealed to the city council within five business days of the date of written notice of the decision. The appeal shall be made by filing a written petition with the city clerk setting forth the name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; a detailed description of the specific action to be reviewed; the specific grounds for the review; and the relief or action sought from the city council. The appeal shall not be deemed filed until the written petition has been completed as required herein and any required fee for appeal has been paid. The city council shall not be required to hear any appeal that is not filed in conformance with this chapter. The city council shall hold a hearing on the appeal, at which evidence shall be taken, and the city council shall exercise its discretion in the determination of relevant facts. Failure to file an appeal with the city council shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies unless the applicant can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that due to timeliness or other circumstances recognized by law the filing of such appeal would be futile.

C.    In making a determination on appeal as to whether the application fee or service charges shall be waived or defrayed by the city, or whether the insurance requirements may be waived, the city manager and/or city council shall apply the criteria set forth in Section 9.24.160 requiring the finding of a public purpose, and any other criteria set forth in this chapter.

D.    The city manager and/or the city council may refer the matter to a hearing officer.

E.    Judicial Review. Following exhaustion of administrative remedies as set forth above, to the extent such exhaustion requirement is not futile due to timeliness or other circumstances recognized by law, applicant may file a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 or 1094.8 regarding the validity of the city’s decision regarding the application. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.120 Service charges.
A.    For any special event the chief of police shall require pre-payment of traffic control and related costs, including the salaries and benefits of city personnel involved in traffic control, fire safety, or other facility or event support, the use of city equipment, clean-up costs, and other non-personnel expenses. Upon approval of an application for a special event permit, the chief of police shall provide the permittee with a statement of the estimated cost of such expenses. The permittee will be required to pre-pay prior to the issuance of the special event permit unless the chief of police for good cause extends time for payment or, if the applicant appeals the required payment, the city council in its discretion finds that a public purpose supports the city funding, partially funding or waiving such fees. In making this determination the city council shall apply the factors set forth in Section 9.24.160.

B.    In calculating the costs of the special event under subsection A of this section, the chief of police will only consider the size of the special event, the number of people attending and participating, and other characteristics of the special event as listed on the application for a special event permit. The chief of police shall not speculate as to any hostile behavior from the audience, viewers, or participants in determining the cost and amount of city services. The costs incurred by the city to provide police protection to those engaged in expressive activity shall not be included in the service charges.

C.    If the actual cost for services on the date of the event is less than the estimated cost under subsection A of this section, the permittee will be refunded the difference in cost by the city. If the actual cost is more than the estimated cost, the permittee shall pay the difference in cost to the city. In the event pre-payment is waived on appeal, failure to pay within thirty days of invoice shall result in interest and penalties to the same extent as set forth in Section 5.04.210.

D.    No permittee shall be required to pay for the cost of public safety personnel to provide for the protection of a community event and its attendees from hostile members of the public or counter-demonstrations or for general law enforcement in the vicinity of the event.

E.    The service charge requirement shall be waived as to an applicant who qualifies as an indigent natural person, who is eligible for county relief and support under the California Welfare and Institutions Code, and who seeks to exercise First Amendment rights. Application for indigent status shall be made at the time of permit application and shall be accompanied by such relevant information and documentation as may, in the opinion of the police chief, be reasonably necessary to verify such status. For purposes of this subsection, “indigency” includes, but is not limited to, a person eligible for county relief and support as an indigent person under the California Welfare and Institutions Code, a person receiving benefits pursuant to Supplemental Security Income and/or State Supplemental Payments, and a person receiving food stamps. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.130 Insurance.
A.    Except as exempted by this section, the permittee shall procure and maintain in full force and effect during the term of the permit a policy of insurance from a reliable insurance company authorized to do business in the state, which shall be maintained in full force and effect during the term of the permit, which policy includes the city, its boards, officers, agents, employees, and volunteers as named insureds or additional named insureds and which provides the coverage that the risk manager determines to be necessary and adequate under the circumstances. Proof of insurance shall be submitted to the city prior to issuance of the permit and maintenance of this insurance shall be a condition of the permit. The insurance required by this chapter shall encompass all liability insurance requirements imposed for other licenses or permits required under any other provision of the San Pablo Municipal Code and is to be provided for the benefit of the city and not as a duty, expressed or implied, to provide insurance protection for spectators or participants.

B.    The insurance requirement set forth in this section shall not apply to special events that involve expressive activity which enjoy protection under the United States or California Constitutions; provided, that the permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city as set forth in Section 9.24.140. A claim for exemption under this section shall be filed with and at the same time as an application for a permit. The city may require such proof and documentation as reasonably necessary to verify the constitutionally protected status of the special event.

C.    For special events not involving expressive activities as defined in this chapter, insurance coverage shall not be required if the city manager determines that the event does not present a substantial risk of public liability or property damage. If the city manager determines that a particular use, event or activity does not present a substantial or significant public liability or property damage exposure for the city or its officers, agents, and employees, the city manager may give a written waiver of the insurance requirements of this section. In making such a determination, the city manager will consider and identify any risks, hazards, or dangers to public health or safety.

D.    For expressive activities as defined in this chapter which desire to use city park space or facilities otherwise subject to regulations promulgated for the city’s recreation division, the provisions of this chapter shall supersede contrary requirements in such regulations. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.140 Indemnification.
A.    Each permit shall expressly provide that the permittee agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold the city, its officers, employees and agents free and harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of permittee, its officers, agents, or employees in connection with the permitted event or activity; and the permit shall expressly provide that the permittee shall, at permittee’s own cost, risk and expense, defend any and all claims or legal actions that may be commenced or filed against the city, its officers, agents, or employees, and that permittee shall pay any settlement entered into and shall satisfy any judgment that may be rendered against the city, its officers, agents, or employees as a result of the alleged acts or omissions of permittee or permittee’s officers, agents, or employees in connection with the uses, events or activities under the permit.

B.    This section shall not be construed so as to require a permittee to indemnify the city for any damage or harm caused by the city itself or by third parties outside the control of the permittee, or for losses to the city occasioned by the reaction to the permittee’s expressive activity. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.150 Revocation or suspension of permit.
A.    A permit issued under this chapter shall be revoked or suspended by the chief of police if he or she finds one or more of the following:

1.    The permit is being used to conduct an activity different than that for which it was issued;

2.    The activity is being conducted in a manner which violates one or more of the conditions imposed upon the issuance of the permit or fails to conform to the plans and procedures described in the application;

3.    The applicant violates or attempts to violate any federal, state or local laws and regulations;

4.    The special event is being conducted in a fraudulent or disorderly manner, or in a manner which endangers the public health or safety;

5.    The special event permit was issued in error or contrary to law; or

6.    To the extent it might be required pursuant to Section 9.24.130, the applicant or event organizer fails to obtain and maintain in full force and effect during the term of the special event permit any insurance required by this chapter.

B.    Such revocation or suspension shall become effective immediately upon order of the chief of police and shall remain in effect until the applicant has corrected the violation or the permit has expired on its own terms.

C.    In the event a permit is revoked or suspended pursuant to the provisions of this section, another permit shall not be granted to the applicant within twelve months after the date of such revocation or suspension.

D.    The chief of police’s determination to revoke or suspend a permit shall be based upon written findings and shall be final and conclusive, subject to review under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 or 1994.8. To the extent a permit is revoked or suspended prior to the event and there is time to file an appeal with the city manager and/or city council, the provisions of Section 9.24.110 shall apply. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.160 Co-sponsorship and financial contributions by city.
A.    If the city council finds that a public purpose is served, it may choose to support or promulgate said public purpose by co-sponsoring or defraying the cost of the event by giving cash grants, paying for charged fees and costs out of the city treasury, allowing use of the city seal or name at the event and for advertising purposes, or providing city personnel, services, and equipment; provided, however, that the direct and indirect cost of such services does not exceed a total of ten thousand dollars.

B.    In determining whether a public purpose is served, the city council must find all of the following:

1.    The event is organized and conducted by a tax-exempt, non-profit organization which operates from or provides services within the city of San Pablo.

2.    The event provides a benefit to the general public.

3.    The event includes participation by the general public (notwithstanding an admission or participation fee).

4.    Where the city defrays the cost of such services, provision of city services will result in improved crowd or event control and general public safety.

5.    The event advertises, promotes, or calls positive attention to the city, its resources, attractions, advantages, enterprises, climate, or facilities.

6.    The cost to the city does not exceed fifty percent of the total cost for city services for the entire event. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.170 Unlawful to use city name without authorization.
It is unlawful for any event organizer to use in the title of the event the words “The City of San Pablo” or “City of San Pablo,” or facsimile of the seal or logo of the city of San Pablo, without city’s written authorization. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.180 Interfering with activity prohibited.
It is unlawful for any person to obstruct, impede or interfere with any authorized assembly, person, vehicle or animal participating in a special event for which a special event permit has been issued. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.190 Violations.
A.    Any person violating or permitting, counseling, or assisting the violation of any of the provisions in this chapter shall be subject to any and all civil and administrative remedies. All remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive. Any violation of these provisions shall constitute a separate violation for each and every day during which such violation is committed or continued.

B.    The holding or conducting of any special event subject to the provisions of this chapter without a valid permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or in violation of the provisions of its permit, unless expressly exempt hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance.

C.    Any person who intentionally violates any of the provisions of this chapter or any of the provisions of a permit issued hereunder shall be guilty of an infraction. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

9.24.200 Severability.
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase in this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this chapter or any part thereof. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid, or ineffective. (Ord. 2010-004 § 2 (part), 2010)

It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult-oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city of San Pablo. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. (Ord. 07-009 § 3 (part), 2007)

9.28.020 Definitions.

A.    Adult-oriented business regulatory permits are nontransferable, except in accordance with Section

9.32.010 Purpose and intent—Daytime curfew.
A.    State law requires all persons between the ages of six and eighteen to attend school. Regular school attendance provides important benefits not only to the students themselves but also to the health, safety, and welfare of all residents within the city. Regular school attendance promotes employability upon graduation and reduces delinquency as well as the potential for future dependence upon public assistance.

B.    The community as a whole suffers when a minor student is not attending school. Truancy or unexcused absenteeism from school results in a loss of educational opportunities to the student and a loss of revenue to the school. Truancy also often leads to vandalism, petty theft, daytime burglaries, and other criminal activity. Truants often tend to loiter in and about public places; frequently, persons going about their lawful business as well as public property become targets of the delinquent behaviors of truants when they should be in school.

C.    It is the intent of the city council of the city of San Pablo, by this chapter and in cooperation and coordination with the West Contra Costa County Unified School District, by the exercise of the city’s traditional police powers and its curfew powers over minors, to establish and enforce a curfew upon minors of school age on school days during the hours between eight a.m. and two p.m., with stated exceptions, in order to provide protection for the community and public property from deleterious effects of truancy. This is not intended to abridge or interfere with the lawful rights of parents or other legal guardians or to contravene or supersede the laws of the state of California dealing with such matters.

D.    This chapter may be cited as the “San Pablo Youth Protection Ordinance.” (Ord. No. 2009-006, § 2, 10-6-09)

9.32.070 Purpose and intent—Nighttime curfew.
A second purpose of this chapter is to provide uniform guidelines to regulate the activity for youth during certain nighttime hours and create a safer environment for the young people of the city. The city council of the city of San Pablo finds that:

A.    The personality of a community changes during the nighttime hours, particularly after ten p.m. Many areas that are normally considered safe, during daylight and early evening hours, become hazardous during nighttime hours.

B.    Persons under the age of eighteen may be particularly susceptible, by way of their lack of maturity and experience, to become involved in crimes, either as victims or suspects.

C.    Crimes committed against and by persons under the age of eighteen, between the hours of ten p.m. and five a.m., are increasing.

D.    It is necessary to provide an enforcement tool which will assist in providing protection for the youth of the city, during certain nighttime hours, by reducing the likelihood that youth will become victims of criminal activity; reducing the likelihood that youth will become suspects of criminal activity; and by aiding parents and guardians in carrying out their responsibility to exercise supervision of the youth entrusted to their care. (Ord. No. 2009-006, § 2, 10-6-09)

9.32.080 Prohibited activity—Nighttime curfew.

C.    No person employed by or having control of any cafe, tavern, restaurant, bar, drive-in, public dance, or place of public amusement shall serve or permit the use of the facilities thereof to any minor not accompanied by a parent, guardian, or other adult person having the legal care and custody of the minor between the hours of ten p.m. and five a.m.

D.    This section shall be interpreted by the police department and courts in a manner so as not to violate First Amendment rights protected by the United States or California Constitutions, such as the free exercise of religion or speech. (Ord. No. 2009-006, § 2, 10-6-09)

9.32.090 Lawful excuses for violating nighttime curfew.
It shall be permissible for a youth to remain in a public place within the city between the hours of ten p.m. and five a.m. under the following circumstances:

A.    When the youth is accompanied by the youth’s parent or guardian;

B.    When the youth is on an errand at the direction of the youth’s parent or guardian, without any detour or stop;

C.    When the youth is in a motor vehicle involved in interstate travel, or other travel not in violation of this chapter;

D.    When the youth is engaged in an employment activity, or going to or returning home from an employment activity, without any detour or stop;

E.    When the youth is involved in an emergency;

F.    When the youth is attending an official school, religious, recreational or social activity, such as a movie, play, dance concert, or sporting event, or going to or returning home from such activity, or inside a commercial establishment actively receiving goods or services;

G.    When the youth is married, an active member of the United States military, or has been emancipated in accordance with the California Family Code Section 7000;

H.    When the youth is waiting at an officially designated bus stop or other transit provider stop, during the hours that those modes of transportation function. (Ord. No. 2009-006, § 2, 10-6-09)

9.32.100 Enforcement and penalties—Nighttime curfew.
This chapter shall be enforced and administered pursuant to the provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code Section 625.5(c), 626 and 626.5, subject to the following guidelines:

A.    Any youth who violates the provisions of this chapter relating to nighttime curfew shall be subject to the following penalties and punishment:

4.    Any youth who violates the provisions of this chapter relating to nighttime curfew a fourth time shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the provisions of Chapter 2 of Division 2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of the State of California.

D.    Officers believing parents or guardians are in violation of this chapter shall evaluate each incident on its own merits.

E.    Officers shall use appropriate discretion and take into account the totality of the circumstances. Upon a first violation, officers may, but need not, issue a warning citation as set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code section 625.5(d). (Ord. No. 2009-006, § 2, 10-6-09)

Each day that a violation of this chapter is committed or continues, is a separate offense and is punishable as a distinct and separate offense. (Ord. 84-015 § 1 (part), 1984)

C.    The notice given by the city engineer to provide the required underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is required to be done, and shall state that if said work is not completed within thirty days after receipt of such notice, the city engineer will provide such required underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof will be assessed against the property benefitted and become a lien upon such property.

D.    If upon the expiration of the thirty-day period, the required underground facilities have not been provided, the city engineer shall forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished thereto, the city engineer shall, in lieu of providing the required underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to said property. Upon completion of the work by the city engineer, he shall file a written report with the city council setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the property against which such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of the cost of such work upon such premises, which said time shall not be less than ten days thereafter.

E.    The city engineer shall forthwith, upon the time for hearing such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing thereof to the owner thereof, in the manner provided in this section for the giving of the notice to provide that required underground facilities, of the time and place that the council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such assessment.

If any assessment is not paid within five days after its confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien upon the property against which the assessment is made by the city engineer, and the city engineer is directed to turn over to the county assessor and tax collector a notice of lien on each of said properties on which the assessment has not been paid, and said county assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of said assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises upon which said assessment was not paid. Said assessment shall be due and payable at the same time as said property taxes are due and payable, and if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per year.

15.28.010 Statutory authorization.
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.020 Findings of fact.
A.    The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B.    These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.030 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A.    To protect human life and health;

B.    To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C.    To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D.    To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E.    To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F.    To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G.    To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H.    To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A.    Restrictions or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B.    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C.    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

D.    Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E.    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.060 Lands to which this chapter applies.
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the city. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.070 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard, identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “Flood Insurance Study for the City of San Pablo,” dated April 16, 2004, as it may be amended from time to time, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFM), letter of map revision (LOMR) dated November 24, 2010, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This flood insurance study is on file at the office of public works of the city of San Pablo. This flood insurance study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this ordinance and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. (Ord. 13-002 § 3, 2013: Ord. 04-006 § 1, 2004: Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.080 Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.090 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.100 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be:

A.    Considered as minimum requirements;

B.    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C.    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.110 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards, or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.120 Severability.
If any sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases or portions of this chapter are for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed this and each section, subsection, phrase or clause of this chapter whether or not any one or more sections, subsections, phrases or clauses may be declared invalid or unconstitutional on their face or as applied. (Ord. 13-002 § 4, 2013: Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

C.    Elevation and Floodproofing.

1.    New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in subsection (C)(2) of this section. Upon the completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

2.    Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance with subsection (C)(1) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:

a.    Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b.    Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

c.    Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this section are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

3.    Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a.    Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters; or

b.    Be certified to comply with a local floodproofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration.

4.    Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 15.28.190. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.170 Standards for utilities.
A.    All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from systems into flood waters.

B.    On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

D.    All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

E.    All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. (Ord. 13-002 § 7, 2013; Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.190 Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
A.    All new and replacement manufactured homes and additions to manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation, and shall be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement.

B.    All recreational vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall either:

1.    Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; or

2.    Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or

3.    Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.28.150 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in this section. (Ord. 13-002 § 8, 2013: Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.200 Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.28.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A.    Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B.    If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.28.160 through 15.28.200. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.210 Appeal board.
A.    The city council of the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B.    The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C.    In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.    The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated developments;

8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.    The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

D.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (C)(1) through (11) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

E.    Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

F.    The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.28.220 Conditions for variances.
A.    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

B.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

C.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

D.    Variances shall only be issued upon:

1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

E.    Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

F.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the city in the office of the Contra Costa County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. (Ord. 13-002 § 9, 2013; Ord. 87-009 § 1 (part), 1987)

15.42.010 Findings and intent.
A.

B.    Protection of the environment, and the public health, safety and welfare requires the establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions may be prevented. (Ord. 93-004 § 1 (part), 1993)

Any public nuisance set forth in this chapter may be abated by the city, and city expenses recovered, pursuant to the city property maintenance ordinance (Chapter 8.02 of this code), and any person aggrieved by a decision or action of the building official pursuant to this chapter may challenge such decision or action in any hearing pursuant to such ordinance.

C.    Property owners with buildings located within the city that are boarded as of the date of adoption of this chapter will be given a six month grace period to comply with the provisions of this chapter. The grace period will be considered the same as if an initial boarding permit was granted by the building official. At the end of the six month period, any such boarded building will be considered a public nuisance unless the property owner has applied for and received a renewal boarding permit. Property owners with boarded buildings which fall under the provisions of this subsection will be notified by mail of the conditions and requirements of this chapter.

D.    Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the building official shall have the discretion to grant a property owner a grace period of five working days to apply for a permit in emergency situations such as natural disasters or other unforeseen circumstances. (Ord. 93-004 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.42.030 Nuisances—Specified.
A.    It is declared unlawful and a public nuisance for any owner of property in this city to allow to exist on such property any building or structure whose doors, windows or other openings are broken or missing, so as to allow access to the interior; or which is not temporarily boarded and secured in compliance with Section 15.42.040 of this chapter within the time set forth by the building official in the permit; or which is left in such temporary boarded up condition after the expiration of any initial or renewed boarding permit.

B.    It is declared unlawful and a public nuisance for any person, firm, association or corporation to erect, install, place or maintain boards over the doors, windows or other openings of any building or structure or otherwise secure such openings by a means other than the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure without a valid, current and unexpired boarding permit therefor from the building official. No initial boarding permit shall be issued for a period of greater than six months. Upon an application and a showing of good cause, the building official may issue renewals of such permits, provided however, that the maximum time periods for the initial permit and all such renewals, taken together, shall not exceed twelve months.

C.    The fees for the issuance or renewal of a boarding permit shall initially be ninety-six dollars plus any expenses required to conduct title searches. Such fee shall automatically be adjusted as the personnel costs upon which the fee is based rise or fall. If a different method of calculation makes it necessary, council may increase or decrease such fee in the future by resolution. Upon payment of the required fee, the building official shall issue or renew a boarding permit upon the submission of a written application by the property owner or his/her authorized representative or contractor and upon the confirmation by a city building inspector that the boarding or other method of securing the building will or has been done in compliance with this chapter.

D.    Any person violating or causing the violation of this chapter shall be guilty of an infraction as provided for in Section 1.08.010 of this code, in addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter or under applicable law. (Ord. 93-004 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.42.040 Standards for securing building.
A.    The temporary boarding of the doors, windows or other openings of any building or structure or any means of securing such openings, other than by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure, shall comply with the following minimum standards:

1.    Windows. Windows and similar openings shall be boarded with exterior grade plywood of minimum thickness five-eighths inch or its equivalent. Vent holes may be required, as deemed necessary by the building official. The plywood shall be secured in place by two by four or four by four cross members, secured to the plywood by three-eighths inch plated carriage bolts with large washers at each end and with the cross member turned so that the carriage bolt goes through the larger dimension. Bolts used to secure the cross member shall be threaded to the correct length. A minimum of two cross members shall be used on each window and, depending on the size of the opening, additional cross members may be required by the building official. Each cross member shall be a continuous piece of lumber, and each must extend at least one foot past the window opening in each direction. Bolts and nuts used to secure the cross members to the plywood must be tightened enough to slightly deflect the wood. Bolt heads must fit tightly against the wood and not give a purchase for pliers or pry bars. Windows shall be secured in accordance with this section even if they are already covered with security bars.

2.    Exterior Doors. Exterior doors shall be boarded with exterior grade plywood of a minimum thickness of three-fourths inch or its equivalent, fitted to the entry door jamb with maximum one-eighths inch clearance each edge. The existing door should be removed. The plywood shall be attached to three horizontal two by four wooden crossbars with two each three-eighths inch carriage bolts and matching hardware. The plywood shall be attached to the door entry with three case hardened strap hinges of the type specified by the building official and the plywood shall be secured by a case hardened steel hasp and minimum two inch case hardened padlock also of the type specified by the building official.

3.    Painting of Boarded Openings. All boarded openings shall be painted with a minimum of one coat of exterior paint which is of a dark gray or similar earth color or a color compatible with the exterior color of the building or structure. Alternative approaches to painting will be subject to city/redevelopment agency design review.

4.    Garages. Overhead garage doors shall be secured. Nailing the door to the jamb or nailing pieces of two by four to the jamb is not acceptable. The overhead door shall be padlocked with the existing garage lock or a newly installed one. All padlocks used must be keyed alike. In an attached garage it is acceptable to insert a piece of two by four lumber through the overhead mechanism on the inside of the door. The two by four shall be long enough to go through both sides of the mechanism or shall be nailed in place on the inside so that it can not fall out. Secondary garage entrances to the outside of the garage shall be secured with strong-backed plywood. Access doors between the house and attached garage need not be boarded. Detached garages shall be secured in the same manner as attached garages. Access shall be provided by padlock.

B.    Alternative Methods of Securing a Building. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the building official may approve alternative methods of securing doors, windows or other openings of any building or structure. In making the determination to approve any alternative method, the building official shall consider the aesthetic and other impacts of such method on the immediate neighborhood and the extent to which such method provides adequate and long-term security against the unauthorized entry to the property.

A written description of all relocation and moving assistance and information to be given to each tenant, and all the steps the subdivider will take to ensure the successful relocation of each tenant, in the event that conversion takes place. The report, to be given to all tenants, should pay particular attention to what assistance will be provided to the elderly, handicapped, large families (five or more) and other tenants who may encounter difficulty finding new quarters. In order to reduce the number of such tenants being displaced, subdivider shall consider incentives and inducements that would permit tenants to become owners in the condominium.

3.    That a tenant’s rent shall not be increased for one year from the time of the filing of the tentative map until relocation takes place, or until the subdivision is denied or withdrawn;

4.    That the subdivider shall provide moving expenses of one and one-half times the monthly rent plus the difference between the current and new security deposit, to any tenant who relocates from the building to be converted after receipt of notification from the applicant of his intention to convert, except when the tenant has given notice of his intention to move prior to receipt of notification from the applicant of his intention to convert. Any security deposit made by the tenant shall be refunded immediately upon vacation of the rental unit, unless the full amount of the new security deposit was made to the tenant by the applicant prior to vacation of the unit.

D.    At least twenty percent of all units converted shall be affordable and sold to low and moderate income buyers with city-approved and accepted resale restrictions to guarantee that the unit will remain affordable to, and be purchased by, low and moderate income buyers for fifty-nine years following the first sale of the unit(s). Ownership assistance provided in subsection C of this section shall count towards the fulfillment of this item. (Ord. 81-06 (part), 1981; Ord. 80-07 § 6 (part), 1980)

15.44.100 Conditions for approval—Vacancy rate criteria.
It is the intent of the city council, as expressed in the city housing element, that a proposed condominium conversion project will not adversely affect the provision of adequate housing for all segments of the community and that adequate replacement housing for displaced tenants is available. The vacancy rate to be considered in evaluating the adequacy of replacement housing shall be the current rental vacancy factor for the city as determined by vacancy rate surveys by the city. In the event that the rental vacancy rate falls below five percent, the city may deny approval of the condominium conversion project proposal if the city finds that the conversion will significantly reduce the availability of rental units and therefore, the conversion will conflict with the goals and policies contained in the housing element of the general plan. If the rental vacancy rate is found to be below three percent, the application for conversion shall be denied, unless the applicant, for a period of fifty-nine years as outlined in Sections 15.44.050 (H)(7) and 15.44.090 (D), agrees to sell and provide for the maintenance of, at affordable prices, forty percent of the units to low and moderate income households, with a minimum of twenty percent being affordable to households earning less than eighty percent of the San Francisco SMSA median income; provided, that the city council may still deny approval of the application if the proposed condominium conversion project is found to adversely affect the provision of adequate housing for all segments of the community and that adequate replacement housing for displaced tenants is unavailable. In the event that the applicant disagrees with the vacancy rate findings, he may order, at his own expense, another vacancy rate survey to be conducted by the city. (Ord. 81-06 (part), 1981; Ord. 80-07 § 6 (part), 1980)

15.44.110 Conditions for disapproval.
The city shall not approve an application for condominium conversion unless the city finds that:

A.    All provisions of this chapter are met; and

B.    The proposed conversion is consistent with the city of San Pablo general plan; and

C.    The overall design and physical condition of the condominium conversion achieves a high degree of appearance, quality, and safety; and

D.    The proposed conversion will not displace a significant percentage of low and moderate income or senior citizen tenants and delete a significant number of low and moderate income rental units from the city’s housing stock at a time when no equivalent housing is readily available in the city of San Pablo area. (Ord. 80-07 § 7, 1980)

15.44.120 Certificate of use and occupancy.
The certificate of use and occupancy shall be issued by the city after completion of construction if all required improvements and conditions of the tentative and final maps are met. (Ord. 81-06 (part), 1981)

15.44.130 Processing fees.
Processing fees applicable to condominium conversion proposals shall be established by resolution. (Ord. 81-06 (part), 1981; Ord. 80-07 § 9, 1980)

15.44.140 Appeals.
A.    Any person aggrieved by any interpretation, decision or action taken by the planning commission may appeal such action to the city council.

B.    Appeals shall be addressed to the city council on a prescribed form and shall clearly state the basis of the appeal. Appeals shall be filed with the city clerk within fifteen days following the date of the action from which an appeal is taken.

C.    The city clerk shall set the date of the public hearing within thirty days of the filing of the appeal. Notice of the time and place shall be given by publication in a legal newspaper at least ten days before the hearing, and by posting said notice in a conspicuous place on the subject property ten days prior to said hearing, or by notice through the United States mail, with postage prepaid, to the applicant and person so appealing.

D.    The city council shall render its decision within ten days following the conclusion of the hearing of such appeal.

E.    Failure of the city council to act within the time specified shall be deemed concurrence with the previous decision rendered.

F.    The city council may impose or prescribe conditions in its determination as are, in its opinion, necessary to serve, and which are consistent with the objectives of this chapter. (Ord. 81-06 (part), 1981; Ord. 80-07 § 10, 1980)

NOTICE TO OWNER TO ABATE SUBSTANDARD BUILDING

The building located at ________ has been determined to be a substandard building and public nuisance in violation of state law. You are hereby ORDERED to abate such nuisance within thirty (30) days by either repairing the violations and substandard conditions, as indicated on the attached inspection report, or by obtaining a demolition permit and demolishing the building.

15.52.010 Short title.
This chapter shall be cited as “The residential health and safety ordinance.” (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.020 Definitions.
The following words and phrases, whenever used in this chapter, shall be construed as defined in this section:

“Administrator” means the building official for the city.

“Buyer” means the buyer or transferee, or his authorized agent, who has entered into a real estate transaction agreement with the owner.

“Change in use” means to occupy a unit for other than a residence in accordance with the zoning code for the city.

“City” means the city of San Pablo, California.

“Nonowner occupied” means any unit whose most recent occupant was not the owner.

“Occupant” means any person who occupies a unit whether as an owner, tenant or permittee of the owner.

“Owner” means the owner of record as shown on the last equalized assessment roll or the authorized agent of the owner.

“Person” means an individual, partnership, corporation or association, or rental agent of any of the foregoing.

“Unit” means a dwelling unit in a single-family, two-family, or multiple-family residence building, including motels, hotels and boardinghouses and similar living accommodations. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.030 Certificate required for occupancy.
No person shall occupy, change the use of or sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise permit any nonowner occupied unit more than three years from the original construction date, or any owner-occupied unit more than ten years from the original construction date, to be occupied until a resale certificate of compliance, periodic certificate of compliance, or temporary resale certificate of compliance is issued by the administrator, as provided in this chapter. Failure to obtain any certificate required by this chapter or any other violation of this chapter shall constitute a violation of local codes dealing with health, safety or building within the meaning of Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 17274 and 24436.5. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.040 Resale certificate of compliance—Transfer of residential unit.
A.    When a residential single-family, owner occupied unit more than ten years old, or a residential nonowner occupied unit more than three years old, is being sold, transferred, assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, the owner shall file with the administrator a written application for resale certificate of compliance on a form to be prescribed by the administrator, accompanied by the fee therefor, unless as exempted under subsection B of this section. Within five working days after the application is received the owner shall request an inspection and the administrator shall cause an inspection of the property to be made for compliance with the city’s codes so as to remove or mitigate potential threats to the health and safety of the occupants or future occupants. Units that are being sold and in escrow will have first priority to be inspected. If the unit is determined to be safe, the administrator shall issue a resale certificate of compliance.

B.    If a residential unit has a current, valid periodic certificate of compliance, and has not been sold, transferred, assigned, by operation of law or otherwise within the past twelve months, then a resale certificate of compliance is not needed.

C.    As an alternative to paying for a city inspection of such residential unit, the owner may arrange for an inspection from a private inspection company that is licensed to do business in the city of San Pablo, and which uses and completes a city-approved inspection form. No sale or transfer of the property may occur until such inspector files with the city, under penalty of perjury, an inspection form indicating that all potential threats to the health and safety of the occupants or future occupants have been removed. Such report shall also be served upon the buyer. Upon receipt of such report, the administrator shall issue a resale certificate of compliance, unless he or she has reasonable suspicion justifying an inspection by the city. In such a case, the administrator shall cause an inspection to be made at city’s initial expense, and shall commence abatement proceedings against the property upon discovery of any violations.

C.    If a residential single-family, owner-occupied unit is under ten years of age or a nonowner occupied unit is under three years of age, the administrator shall issue a letter of exemption in lieu of a resale certificate of compliance upon request of the owner. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.044 Temporary resale certificate of compliance.
If the owner cannot complete all work needed to remove or mitigate potential threats to the health and safety of the occupants or future occupants as specified in Section 15.52.040(A) of this chapter before the anticipated date of close of escrow, the buyer may file with the administrator a written application for a temporary resale certificate of compliance. Upon approval of the application and issuance of a temporary resale certificate of compliance by the administrator to the buyer, the buyer shall assume all obligations of the owner as specified in Sections 15.52.040(A) and 15.52.070 of this chapter, and shall comply with the city’s codes so as to remove or mitigate, within sixty days of close of escrow, the potential threats to the health and safety of the occupants or future occupants.

(Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.050 Periodic certificate of compliance—Nonowner occupied unit.
A.    All nonowner occupied units more than three years old shall require a periodic certificate of compliance, unless as exempted under subsection B of this section. When a unit has not previously had a periodic certificate of compliance or when the period indicated on the current periodic certificate of compliance has less than thirty days to expiration the owner shall file with the administrator a written application for a periodic certificate of compliance on a form to be prescribed by the administrator, accompanied by the fee.

B.    If the residential unit has been sold, transferred, assigned, by operation of law or otherwise within the past twelve months, and a valid resale certificate of compliance or temporary resale certificate of compliance was issued, then a periodic certificate of compliance is not required for twelve months after the close of escrow, or until the expiration date of a valid periodic certificate of compliance; whichever is later.

C.    Within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, after the application is received, the owner shall request an inspection and the administration shall cause an inspection of the unit to be made for compliance with health and safety codes.

6.    The certification that the unit complies with the provisions of applicable codes and ordinances.

B.    Periodic certificates of compliance for nonowner occupied units shall be good for periods of twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-eight and sixty months, depending on the number of demerits a property receives at time of original inspection. The administrator shall establish a schedule of demerits and certificate duration.

C.    The periodic certificate of compliance shall be void upon a change of the use of property, or upon expiration.

D.    If a residential nonowner occupied unit is under three years of age, the administrator shall issue a letter of exemption in lieu of a certificate of compliance upon request of the owner. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.070 Noncompliance with existing codes—Correction of deficiencies.
A.    Where an inspection discloses that the property contains code deficiencies that threaten the health and safety of current or future occupants, the administrator shall give written notice of each deficiency to the owner within five days of inspection completion.

B.    No resale certificate of compliance or periodic certificate of compliance shall be issued to the owner until all health and safety deficiencies are corrected. Except as provided in Section 15.52.040(C) of this chapter, all required corrections shall be made prior to completion of the sale or transfer of title.

C.    If the owner fails to correct all such deficiencies within six months after the original application was filed, he shall file a new application and again pay the application fee. If a temporary resale certificate of compliance was issued and the new owner fails to correct all such deficiencies within sixty days after the close of escrow, he shall file a new application and pay the application fee. The acceptance of such new application shall not waive the city’s right to proceed with any civil or criminal remedy for previous failures to comply with this chapter. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.080 Fees established by council resolution.
The filing fees for all certificates of compliance, letters of exemption, or noncompliance fees shall be as established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.090 Availability of property for inspection.
The owner shall be responsible for making the property available for inspection by the city. Should access to any unit be denied by the tenant because of illness, law or any other verifiable, legitimate reason, the owner shall reschedule the inspection at no cost to owner. A noncompliance fee may be charged to the owners if they do not appear for a scheduled inspection or they do not otherwise provide access to the property. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.52.100 Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by the determination of the administrator under this chapter may appeal to the appeals board in the manner provided in the housing code. (Ord. 06-016 § 1 (part), 2006)

15.56.010 Findings.
The council of the city finds and determines that:

A.    Water is a limited resource, particularly in dry years, and must be managed and used efficiently;

B.    Precipitation in California fluctuates annually causing yearly variations in the water supply as demonstrated by water supply shortages experienced in the East Bay municipal utility district service area in six of the last fourteen years;

C.    State and local standards for water use have been established in regard to other water uses, including indoor plumbing fixtures;

D.    In addition to these water-conserving efforts, landscapes should be designed based on the functional use of the landscape and appropriate horticulture, by including plants best suited for the climate. Use of native California plants shall be encouraged wherever possible;

E.    Cities as water users can provide leadership in water conserving landscape and irrigation practices, and a more comprehensive water savings can be achieved if the city adopts landscape requirements for use in its own landscape irrigation activities;

F.    Such landscape requirements do not increase the cost of landscaping when computed over the life of the development and do not diminish the aesthetic quality of the landscaping; and

G.    Outdoor landscaping consumes approximately twenty-five percent of water used in the East Bay municipal utility district service area, and it is well established that frequent overwatering of landscaping can be avoided through appropriate use of plant materials, efficient irrigation systems and good landscape management practices. (Ord. 92-010 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.56.020 Definitions.
The following words and phrases have the meanings ascribed to them in this section:

“Anti-drain valve” or “check valve” means a valve located under a sprinkler head to hold water in the system so it minimizes drainage from the lower elevation sprinkler heads.

“Application rate” means the depth of water applied to a given area, usually measured in inches per hour.

“Applied water” means the portion of water supplied by the irrigation system to the landscape.

“Automatic controller” means a mechanical or solid state timer, capable of operating valve stations to set the days and length of time of a water application.

“Backflow prevention device” means a safety device used to prevent pollution or contamination of the water supply due to the reverse flow of water from the irrigation system.

“Ecological restoration project” means a project where the site is intentionally altered to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem.

“Flow rate” means the rate at which water flows through pipes and valves (gallons per minute or cubic feet per second).

“Hydrozone” means a portion of the landscaped area having plants with similar water needs that are served by a valve or set of valves with the same schedule. A hydrozone may be irrigated or nonirrigated. For example, a naturalized area planted with native vegetation that will not need supplemental irrigation once established is a nonirrigated hydrozone.

“Infiltration rate” means the rate of water entry into the soil expressed as a depth of water per unit of time (inches per hour).

“Landscaped area” means the entire parcel less the building footprint, driveways, nonirrigated portions of parking lots, hardscapes (such as decks and patios), and other nonporous areas. Water features are included in the calculation of the landscaped areas. Areas dedicated to edible plants, such as orchards or vegetable gardens are not included.

“Mulch” means any material such as leaves, bark, straw or other materials left loose and applied to the soil surface to reduce evaporation.

“Overspray” means the water which is delivered beyond the landscaped area, wetting pavements, walks, structures or other nonlandscaped areas.

“Rain-sensing device” means a system which automatically shuts off the irrigation system when it rains.

“Recreational area” means areas of active play or recreation such as sports fields, school yards, picnic grounds, or other areas with intense foot traffic.

“Recycled water,” “reclaimed water,” or “treated sewage effluent water” means treated or recycled waste water of a quality suitable for nonpotable uses such as landscape irrigation; not intended for human consumption.

“Rehabilitated landscape” means any relandscaping project that requires a permit.

“Runoff” means water which is not absorbed by the soil or landscape to which it is applied and flows from the area. For example, runoff may result from water that is applied at too great a rate (application rate exceeds infiltration rate) or when there is a severe slope.

“Soil moisture sensing device” means a device that measures the amount of water in the soil.

“Soil texture” means the classification of soil based on the percentage of sand, silt and clay in the soil.

“Sprinkler head” means a device which sprays water through a nozzle.

“Turf” means a surface layer of earth containing mowed grass with its roots. Annual bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass, Red fescue, and Tall fescue are cool-season grasses. Bermudagrass, Kikuyugrass, Seashore paspalum, St. Augustine grass, Zoysiagrass, and Buffalo grass are warm-season grasses.

“Valve” means a device used to control the flow of water in the irrigation system. (Ord. 92-010 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sections:

15.60.010    Purpose.

15.60.020    Definitions.

15.60.030    General Requirements.

15.60.040    Guidelines for all development project.

15.60.070    Location.

15.60.010 Purpose.
City and counties must divert 50 percent of all solid waste by January 1, 2000, through source reduction, recycling, and composing activities.

Diverting 50 percent of all solid waste requires the participation of the residential, commercial, industrial, and public sectors.

The lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials that are compatible with surrounding land uses is a significant impediment to diverting solid waste and constitutes an urgent need for state and local agencies to address access to solid waste for source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. This ordinance has been developed to meet that need. (Ord. No. 94-012, Enacted, 9/6/94)

15.60.020 Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to the language contained in this ordinance:

A.    DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - Means any of the following:

1)    A project for which a building permit is required for a commercial, industrial, or institutional building, marina, or residential building having five or more living units, where solid waste is collected and loaded and any residential project where solid waste is collected and loaded in a location serving five or more living units.

2)    Any new public facility where solid waste is collected and loaded and any improvements for areas of a public facility used for collecting and loading solid waste.

3)    The definition of development project only includes subdivisions or tracts of single-family detached homes if, within such subdivisions or tracts, there is an area where solid waste is collected and loaded in a location which serves five or more living units. In such instances, recycling areas as specified in this ordinance are only required to serve the needs of the living units which utilize the solid waste collection and loading area.

B.    IMPROVEMENT - An improvement adds to the value of a facility, prolongs its useful life, or adapts it to new uses. Improvements should be distinguished from repairs. Repairs keep facilities in good operating condition, do not materially add to the value of the facility, and do not substantially extend the life of the facility.

C.    FLOOR AREA OF A MARINA - The floor area of a marina shall be defined as the space dedicated to the docking or mooring of marine vessels.

D.    PUBLIC FACILITY - The definition of public facility includes, but is not limited to buildings, structures, marinas, and outdoor recreation areas owned by a local agency.

E.    RECYCLING AREA (AREAS FOR RECYCLING) - Space allocated for collecting and loading of recyclable materials. Such areas shall have the ability to accommodate receptacles or recyclable materials. Recycling areas shall be accessible and convenient for those who deposit as well as those who collect and load any recyclable materials placed therein. (Ord. No. 94-012, Enacted, 9/6/94)

15.60.030 General Requirements.
A.    Any new development project for which an application for a building permit is submitted on or after September 1, 1994, shall include adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials.

B.    Any improvements for areas of a public facility used for collecting and loading solid waste shall include adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials.

C.    Any existing development project for which an application for a building permit is submitted on or after September 1, 1994 for a single alteration which is subsequently performed that adds 30 percent or more of the existing floor area of the development project shall provide adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials.

D.    Any existing development project for which an application for a building permit is submitted on or after September 1, 1994 for multiple alterations which are conducted within a twelve (12) month period which collectively add 30 percent or more to the existing floor area of the development project shall provide adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials.

E.    Any existing development project for which multiple applications for building permits are submitted within a twelve (12) month period beginning on or after September 1, 1994 for multiple alterations which are subsequently performed that collectively add 30 percent or more to the existing floor area of the development project shall provide adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials.

F.    Any existing development project occupied by multiple tenants, one of which submits on or after September 1, 1994, an application for a building permit for a single alteration which is subsequently performed that adds 30 percent or more to the existing floor area of that portion of the development project which said tenant leases shall provide adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials. Such recycling areas shall, at a minimum, be sufficient in capacity, number, and distribution to serve that portion of the development project which said tenant leases.

G.    Any existing development project occupied by multiple tenants, one of which submits on or after September 1, 1994 an application for a building permit for multiple alterations which are conducted within a twelve (12) month period which collectively add 30 percent or more to the existing floor area of that portion of the development project which said tenant leases shall provide adequate, accessible, and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials. Such recycling areas shall, at a minimum, be sufficient in capacity, number, and distribution to serve that portion of the development project which said tenant leases.

Such recycling areas shall, at a minimum, be sufficient in capacity, number, and distribution to serve that portion of the development project which said tenant leases.

I.    Any costs associated with adding recycling space to existing development projects shall be the responsibility of the party or parties who are responsible for financing the alterations. (Ord. 94-012 (part), 1994)

15.60.040 Guidelines for all development project.
A.    Where local standards exist, recycling areas should be designed to be architecturally compatible with nearby structures and with the existing topography and vegetation, in accordance with such standards.

B.    The design and construction of recycling areas shall not prevent security of any recyclable materials placed therein.

C.    The design, construction, and location of recycling areas shall not be in conflict with any applicable federal, state, or local laws relating to fire, building, access, transportation, circulation, or safety.

D.    Recycling areas or the bins or containers placed therein must provide protection against adverse environmental conditions, such as rain, which might render the collected materials unmarketable.

Sections:

15.62.010    Title.

15.62.020    Purpose.

15.62.030    Findings.

15.62.040    Fees.

15.62.050    Project descriptions, funding commitments, eligible costs, and implementation schedule.

15.62.010 Title.
The title of this chapter is the West County Subregional Transportation Mitigation Program 2019 Update. (Ord. 19-001 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 06-010 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 97-007 § 1 (part), 1997)

15.62.020 Purpose.
The purpose of the Subregional Transportation Mitigation Program (STMP) Update and the STMP fee set forth in this chapter is to meet the intent of Measure J by levying a fee on new development to mitigate the regional impacts of new trips generated by that development. Further, the purpose of the STMP fee set forth in this chapter is to raise funds for regional transportation projects in West Contra Costa County. (Ord. 19-001 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 06-010 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 97-007 § 1 (part), 1997)

15.62.030 Findings.
A.    The STMP fee is required to defray all or a portion of the costs of building transportation capital improvement projects needed to mitigate impacts of new development projects.

B.    The STMP fee will raise funds for twenty projects, in the general categories of freeway and interchange improvements, local street and intersection improvements, transit and station-related improvements, bicycle and pedestrian-focused improvements, and complete streets projects. A detailed description of the projects can be found in Section 15.62.050.

C.    The total cost of the twenty projects is approximately eight hundred fifty-five million dollars in 2018 dollars. The nexus study report determined the amount of eligible funding that could be collected through the STMP program at one hundred sixty-one million eight hundred thousand dollars.

D.    The nexus findings, in conformance with Government Code Section 66000 et seq. can be found in the “2019 Nexus Update of the Subregional Transportation Mitigation Program (STMP) Impact Fee” (hereinafter referred to as the 2019 STMP Nexus Update) prepared by Fehr & Peers for the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee (WCCTAC) dated December 2018. Two copies of the 2019 STMP Nexus Update are on file with the city clerk.

E.    The 2019 STMP Nexus Update included the following steps:

1.    Projecting the amount of new development anticipated in West Contra Costa County;

2.    Setting criteria for identifying eligible capital improvement projects;

3.    Specifying the transportation improvements needed to accommodate growth;

4.    Evaluating the relationship between the improvements, the share of funding from new development, and the impacts of new trip generation;

5.    Allocating the costs across land use types; and

6.    Preparing fee schedules and implementation documents.

F.    After considering the 2019 STMP Nexus Update, the testimony received at a noticed public hearing, the agenda statements, the general plan, and all correspondence received (together, the “record”), the city council approves and adopts the 2019 STMP Nexus Update and incorporates such report herein.

G.    Adoption of the STMP fee set forth in this chapter, as it relates to development within the city, is intended to obtain funds for capital projects necessary to maintain service within the WCCTAC area. Accordingly, this fee, as it relates to development within the city, is not a “project” within the meaning of the California Environmental Quality Act. (Public Resources Code Section 21080(b)(8)(D).)

H.    The record establishes and finds:

1.    That there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the STMP fee set forth in this chapter (funding for transportation capital infrastructure projects) and the type of development projects on which this fee is imposed in that all development in the city—both residential and nonresidential—will contribute to the need for the projects listed in Section 15.62.050; and

2.    That there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the projects listed in Section 15.62.050 and the type of development projects on which this fee is imposed in that new development in the city—both residential and nonresidential—will generate persons who live, work, shop, travel to and from, commute to and from, and visit the city and who, therefore, contribute to the need for the projects listed in Section 15.62.050; and

3.    That there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee set forth in this chapter and the cost of the projects listed in Section 15.62.050 or portion of such projects attributable to the development on which this fee is imposed in that such fee is calculated based on projections described in the 2019 STMP Nexus Update of new development, the total cost of the projects listed in Section 15.62.050, and allocation of a fair share of costs to new development across the various land use types. (Ord. 19-001 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 06-010 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 97-007 § 1 (part), 1997)

15.62.040 Fees.
A.    Levy of the Fee and Fee Structure. In order to fund the program and projects stated herein, the following updated STMP fee schedule shall be implemented July 1, 2019, and shall terminate on March 31, 2040.

City is responsible for determining the appropriate land use category and fee amount to apply to specific development projects being considered by their jurisdiction. City will refer to the STMP administrative guidelines for guidance on how to apply these land use categories to development projects. The STMP administrative guidelines are incorporated into the master cooperative agreement by and among the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, the cities of El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, and San Pablo, the county of Contra Costa and the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee for the 2019 Subregional Transportation Mitigation Fee Program (“cooperative agreement”) and may be changed from time to time by the WCCTAC executive director. The cooperative agreement and initial version of the STMP administrative guidelines are available from WCCTAC or the city clerk.

B.    In addition to the STMP fee imposed by subsection A of this section, each applicant shall pay the city an administrative fee as set forth in the city’s master fee schedule, payable to the city at the time of issuance of a building permit. The administrative fee shall be no greater than the cost incurred by the city to adopt and administer this chapter, and to collect, report, and transmit appropriate reports and funds to WCCTAC. The administrative fee shall be kept separate from the STMP fees.

C.    No development shall be exempt from the fee, except if application of the fee to the development would be unlawful under and/or conflict with federal, state, or local law and/or regulation. In addition, accessory dwelling units within the footprint of an existing dwelling unit’s habitable space are not required to pay the STMP fee.

D.    A project that reconstructs or reuses an existing structure or development that has been occupied within the previous three years is subject to the fee only to the extent that it would generate more a.m. peak hour vehicle trips than the existing development.

E.    Fees for uses not identified in subsection A of this section shall be determined by the city using the “Other” land use type and according to methodology provided by WCCTAC in the STMP master cooperative agreement and STMP administrative guidelines.

F.    An applicant may receive credit against fees for the dedication of land for right-of-way and/or construction of improvements for specific 2019 STMP projects, where such right-of-way or construction is beyond that which would otherwise be required for approval of the proposed development. The calculation of the amount of credit against fees for 2019 STMP dedications or improvements shall be based upon a determination by the city that such credits are, in fact, exclusive of the dedications, setbacks, improvements, and/or traffic mitigation measures which are required by local ordinance, standards, or other practice. In addition, the credit shall be calculated based upon the actual cost of construction of improvements or, in the case of land dedication, on an independent appraisal approved by the city. City must report any credit to WCCTAC prior to awarding the credit.

An applicant may receive reimbursement from STMP fees paid by other development projects to the extent that the amount of the credit is greater than the STMP fee obligation of the development project. The award of any reimbursement by city must be preapproved by the WCCTAC board; in making that decision, the board will take into consideration criteria and metrics related to funding availability and project prioritization that they use in making other STMP funding decisions.

G.    The fees specified herein shall be made a condition of approval of all tentative and final subdivision maps. The fees shall be collected at the time of the issuance of any building permit.

H.    The STMP fees specified above shall be collected for projects in the entire city.

I.    Fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in a separate segregated interestbearing account, and, together with any interest accumulated on amounts on deposit, shall be remitted on a quarterly basis to WCCTAC or its designee, to be placed in a fund to be used solely for the purposes described in this chapter and in the master cooperative agreement. Any interest accumulated on such funds shall also be used only for the purposes specified in this chapter.

J.    The fees will be used for, but are not limited to, the administration of the STMP, planning, environmental documentation, design, acquisition of rightofway, and construction of the projects.

K.    Effective July 1, 2020, and on each subsequent anniversary date of such date, the amount of each of the developer fees, set forth in subsection A of this section, shall increase or decrease by the annual percentage change in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area for the twelve-month period ending with the February index of the same calendar year. The percentage change will be calculated by WCCTAC, which will notify all signatories to the cooperative agreement of the change.

L.    Pursuant to Government Code Section 66001(d), after the fifth fiscal year following the first deposit of 2019 STMP revenues and every five years thereafter, WCCTAC shall make all required findings with respect to that portion of the fee account or fund remaining unexpended, whether committed or uncommitted. Such findings shall be made in connection with the release of public information required by Government Code Section 66006(b).

M.    Pursuant to Government Code Section 66006, as specified, WCCTAC shall submit a public report to the WCCTAC board on an annual basis, identifying the amount of fee revenues collected and other statutorily required information, which will also be shared with the member agencies’ city managers/county administrator.

N.    Any applicant may appeal the determination of the amount of the STMP fee due, and such appeal shall be made in writing to WCCTAC with supporting documentation. The WCCTAC board shall consider the appeal at a regularly scheduled meeting, and shall make a decision on the appeal. The decision of the WCCTAC board is final.

15.64.010 Purpose.
The State Air Resources Board (ARB) adopted a particulate matter (PM10) Ambient Air Quality Standard (AAQS) in December, 1982, and levels for the PM10 AAQS were selected pursuant to California Code of Regulations Title 17 Section 70200 to protect the health of people who are sensitive to exposure to fine particles. Research indicates that wood-smoke is a significant contributor to PM10 levels that pose significant health risks. The city council desires to lessen the risk to life and property from air pollution from wood-burning appliances; finds that the proposed regulation will significantly reduce the increase in particulate emissions from future installation and construction activities; and finds a need exists to adopt regulations which apply to wood-burning combustion emissions.

16.20.020 Streets, alleys and easements.
As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the subdivider shall dedicate or make an irrevocable offer of dedication of all parcels of land within the subdivision that are needed for streets and alleys, including access rights and abutters’ rights, drainage, public greenways, bicycle paths, trails, scenic easements, public utility easements and other public easements.

The city may elect to accept an irrevocable offer of dedication in lieu of dedication of fee title. (Ord. 05-002 § 1 (part), 2005)

16.20.040 Parklands.
A.    General. This section is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the Subdivision Map Act and the general police power of the city and is for the purpose of providing such additional park and recreational facilities and open space as appropriate pursuant to the general plan of the city. The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment fees as required by this article are in accordance with the policies, principles and standards for park and recreational facilities contained in the general plan.

B.    Requirements. As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the subdivider shall dedicate land; pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the city, for park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this article. The land dedicated or the fees paid, or both, shall be used for community and neighborhood parks and facilities in such a manner that the locations of such parks and facilities bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision generating such dedication or fees, or both.

C.    General Standard. It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, safety and welfare require that three acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within the city be devoted to park and recreational purposes.

D.    Standards and Formula for Dedication. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following standards and formula:

1.    The park standard for the city is three acres per one thousand residents, or 0.003 acres per resident;

2.    The dedication requirement is the sum of the following: 0.003 multiplied by the average number of persons per type of dwelling unit multiplied by the number of dwelling units of that type in the subdivision;

3.    Unless there is evidence to the contrary, such as the most recent census data, the following criteria will be used to estimate the number of persons per type of dwelling unit:

Type of Dwelling

Number of Persons

Multiple family

1.5 per bedroom

Single-family attached

3.0 per dwelling unit

Single-family detached

3.5 per dwelling unit

Two-family

3.0 per dwelling unit

E.    Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication.

1.    General Formula. If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the general plan to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in the city’s discretion, either dedicate land in the amount provided in subsection D of this section or pay a fee in lieu of dedication equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in subsection D of this section and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection G of this section.

2.    Fees in Lieu of Land—Fifty Parcels or Fewer. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, if the proposed subdivision contains fifty parcels or fewer and has no park or recreational facility, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value of the portion of the park or recreational facilities required to serve the needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in subsection D of this section and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection G of this section.

3.    Use of Money. The money collected shall be used, in accordance with the schedule developed pursuant to subsection J of this section, for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision, including the purchase of necessary land and/or improvement of such land for park or recreational purposes. The money shall be committed within five years after payment thereof or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If the money is not committed, it shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision.

F.    Criteria for Requiring Both Dedication and Fee. If the proposed subdivision contains more than fifty parcels, or, in the case of a condominium project, stock cooperative or community apartment, if the proposed subdivision contains more than fifty dwelling units, although the actual number of parcels may be fewer than fifty, the subdivider shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu of dedication in accordance with the following:

1.    When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed in the general plan as the site for a local park or recreational facility, such portion shall be dedicated for local park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection G of this section.

2.    When a major part of the local park or recreational site has already been acquired by the city and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such portion shall be dedicated, and a fee, computed according to subsection G of this section shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated according to subsection D of this section. The fee shall be used for the improvement of the existing park or recreational facility or for the improvement of other neighborhood or community parks and recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision.

G.    Amount of Fee in Lieu of Parkland Dedication. When a fee is required to be paid in lieu of parkland dedication, the amount of the fee shall be based upon the estimated fair market value of the land being subdivided and the estimated fair market value of the land that would otherwise be required to be dedicated according to subsection D of this section. The fair market value shall be as determined by the department at the time of final map or parcel map approval. If the subdivider objects to the fair market value determination, the subdivider may request the city to obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser mutually agreed upon by the city and the subdivider, which appraisal will be considered by the city in determining the fair market value. All costs required to obtain such appraisal shall be borne by the subdivider. For purposes of determining fair market value pursuant to this subsection, the department and any appraiser shall consider, among other things:

1.    Conditions of approval of the tentative map;

2.    The general plan and zoning requirements for the area;

3.    The location and site characteristics of the property; and

4.    Off-site and on-site improvements facilitating use of the property.

H.    Determination of Land or Fee. Whether the city accepts land dedication, or elects to require the payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:

1.    Policies, standards and principles for park and recreation facilities in the general plan;

2.    Topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication;

3.    Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication;

4.    Feasibility of dedication;

5.    Compatibility of dedication with the general plan; and

6.    Availability of previously acquired park property.

The determination by the city as to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination, shall be final and conclusive.

I.    Credit for Improvements and Private Open Space. If the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land, the value of the improvements together with any equipment located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land required by this section. Planned developments, real estate developments, stock cooperatives, and community apartment projects, as defined in Sections 11003, 11003.1, 11003.2, 11003.4 and 11004, respectively, of the Business and Professions Code, and condominiums shall be eligible to receive a credit, as determined by the city council, against the amount of land required to be dedicated, or the amount of the fee imposed, pursuant to this section, for the value of private open space within the development which is usable for active recreational uses.

J.    Procedure.

1.    At the time of the approval or conditional approval of the tentative map, the review authority shall determine, after a report and recommendation from the city manager, whether land, in-lieu fees or a combination of land and fees, shall be dedicated and/or paid by the subdivider.

2.    The review authority may approve, modify or disapprove the recommendation of the city manager; provided, however, any modification of the proposed recommended condition not previously considered by the city manager shall first be referred back to the city manager for a report and further recommendation. The city manager shall report back to the review authority within thirty days. After the receipt and consideration of the report or after thirty days have passed in the event no report is received, the review authority may adopt the condition.

3.    The recommendation of the city manager shall include the following:

a.    The amount of land required;

b.    That a fee be charged in lieu of land;

c.    That a combination of land and a fee be required;

d.    The location of the parkland and, where appropriate, the siting and conceptual design of the park facilities appurtenant thereto, to be dedicated or used in lieu of fees; and

e.    The approximate time when the development of the park or recreation facility shall commence.

4.    At the time of the recording of the final map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land and/or pay the fees as determined by the city. At the discretion of the city, fees shall be paid prior to issuance of any building permit for any structure in the subdivision.

5.    Open space covenants, conditions and restrictions for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the city prior to approval of the final map or parcel map and, if approved, shall be recorded concurrently with the final map of parcel map.

K.    Not Applicable to Certain Subdivisions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following:

1.    Subdivisions containing four or fewer parcels and not used for residential purposes. However, a condition may be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years, the fee pursuant to this section may be required to be paid by the owner of such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit;

2.    Commercial or industrial subdivisions;

3.    Condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. (Ord. 05-002 § 1 (part), 2005)

16.20.050 Reservations.
A.    General. As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the subdivider shall reserve sites, appropriate in area and location, for parks, recreational facilities, fire stations, libraries or other public uses according to the standards and formula contained in this section.

B.    Standards. Where a park, recreational facility, fire station, library or other public use is shown on the general plan or an adopted specific plan, the subdivider may be required by the city to reserve sites as so determined by the city in accordance with the policies and standards contained in the general plan or the adopted specific plan. The reserved area must be of such size and shape as to permit the balance of the property within which the reservation is located to develop in an orderly and efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically infeasible. The reserved area shall be consistent with the general plan or the adopted specific plan and shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit an efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired within the prescribed period.

C.    Procedures. The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall, at the time of approval of the final map or parcel map, enter into a binding agreement to acquire such reserved area within two years after the completion and acceptance of all improvements, unless the period of time is extended by mutual agreement.

D.    Payment to Subdivider. The purchase price for the reserved area shall be the market value thereof at the time of the filing of the tentative map, plus the taxes against the reserved area from the date of the reservation and any other costs incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance of the reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering the reserved area.

E.    Termination. If the public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved does not enter into a binding agreement in accordance with this section, the reservation of the area shall automatically terminate. (Ord. 05-002 § 1 (part), 2005)

16.20.060 Solar access.
As a condition of approval of a tentative map, there may be imposed, in accordance with the provisions of Section 66475.3 of the Subdivision Map Act, a requirement that the subdivider dedicate easements for the purpose of assuring that each parcel or unit in the subdivision shall have the right to receive sunlight across adjacent parcels or units in the subdivision for any solar energy system, as defined in Civil Code Section 801.5. The provisions of this section, however, do not apply to condominium projects that consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building where no new structures are added. In establishing such easements, consideration shall be given to feasibility, contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided and cost. Required easements shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage of a lot that may be occupied by a building or a structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time such tentative map is filed. At the time of tentative map approval, the planning commission or subdivision committee, as the case may be, shall specify the following:

A.    Definitional Standards. The standards for determining the exact dimensions and locations of such easements;

B.    Obstructions. Any restrictions on vegetation, buildings and other objects that would obstruct the passage of sunlight through the easement;

C.    Termination. The terms for conditions, if any, under which an easement may be revised or terminated. (Ord. 05-002 § 1 (part), 2005)

16.34.020 Prohibition.
A.    Restrictions. No person shall sell, lease or finance any parcel or parcels of real property or commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon, except for model homes, or allow occupancy thereof, for which a parcel map or final map is required by the Subdivision Map Act or this title, until such a map, in full compliance with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this title, has been filed for record by the county recorder.

B.    Conveyances. Conveyances of any part of a division of real property for which a parcel map or final map is required by the Subdivision Map Act or this title shall not be made by parcel or block number, letter or other designation unless and until such map has been filed for record by the county recorder.

C.    Exemptions. This section does not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or exempt from any law, including this title, regulating the design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established.

D.    Conditional Approvals. Nothing contained in subsection A of this section shall be deemed to prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease or finance real property or to construct improvements thereon where such sale, lease or financing, or the commencement of such construction is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final map or parcel map, as required under Subdivision Map Act or this title. (Ord. 05-002 § 1 (part), 2005)

16.34.030 Remedies.
A.    Voidable Transactions. Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or this title is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, any heirs, personal representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy thereof within one year after the date of discovery of such violation. The deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his or her assignee, heir or devisee.

B.    Action for Damages. Any grantee, or successor in interest thereof, of real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or the Subdivision Map Act may, within one year of the date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the superior court to recover any damages suffered by reason of such division of property. The action may be brought against the person who so divided the property and against any successors in interest who have actual or constructive knowledge of such division of property.

C.    Effect of Certificate of Compliance. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the conveyance of any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed pursuant to Chapter 16.32 or identified in a recorded final map or parcel map, from and after the date of recording. The provisions of this section shall not limit or affect in any way the rights of a grantee or successor in interest under any other provision of law.

D.    Other Remedies. This chapter does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which the city or other public agency, or any person, firm or corporation may otherwise be entitled, and the city or other public agency, or such person, firm or corporation may file a suit in the superior court to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision or sale, lease, or financing in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this title.

E.    Development Approvals. The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or this title if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or approval shall apply whether the applicant was the owner of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant is either the current owner of record or a vendee thereof with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of an interest in such real property. If the city issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any real property illegally subdivided, the city may impose those additional conditions that would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property. If the property has the same owner of record as at the time of the initial violation, the city may impose conditions applicable to a current division of the property. If a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 16.32, only those conditions stipulated in that certificate shall be applicable. (Ord. 05-002 § 1 (part), 2005)

16.34.040 Notice of violation.
A.    Tentative Notice. Whenever the planning manager finds that any real property has been divided, or any boundary line of any parcel relocated, in violation of this title, he or she shall cause to be mailed, by certified mail to the then current owner of record of the property, a notice of intent to record a notice of violation. The tentative notice of violation shall contain the following:

1.    A description of the real property;

2.    The name(s) and address(es) of the owner(s) of record;

3.    A description of the violation(s) alleged;

4.    An explanation as to why the subject parcel is not lawful under the relevant provisions of this title and the Subdivision Map Act;

5.    A time, date, and place where the planning manager will conduct a meeting to consider such violation(s) of this title; and

6.    A copy of this chapter.

B.    Response by Owner. Within fifteen mailing days of receipt of the tentative notice of violation described in subsection A of this section, the property owner of record shall inform the planning manager in writing of his or her objection to the recordation of a notice of violation. Failure to so inform the planning manager shall result in a notice of violation being recorded with the county recorder pursuant to subsection D of this section.

C.    Opportunity to Present Evidence. The meeting described in subsection A of this section shall be conducted no less than thirty days and no more than sixty days, after the mailing of the tentative notice of violation. At the meeting the owners of the property shall be given the opportunity to present any evidence relevant to show why a notice of violation should not be recorded.

D.    Action by Planning Manager. After the owner has had the opportunity to present evidence at the meeting, the planning manager shall take either of the following actions:

1.    Determine that there has been no violation and mail a clearance letter to the then current owner of record; or

2.    Determine that the property has in fact been illegally divided and record a notice of violation with the county recorder. (Ord. 05-002 § 1 (part), 2005)

The approving authority as designated in Table 17.16-A—Approving Authority for Land Use Entitlements shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed land use or development permit or entitlement in accordance with the requirements of this title. Table 17.16-A—Approving Authority for Land Use Entitlements identifies recommending “R” and final “F” authorities for each permit or entitlement. In acting on a permit, the approving authority shall make all required findings. An action of the approving authority may be appealed pursuant to procedures set forth in Section 17.16.080, Appeals.

B.    Multiple Entitlements. When a proposed project requires more than one permit with more than one approving authority, all project permits shall be processed concurrently and final action shall be taken by the highest level designated approving authority for all such requested permits.

C.    Referral to the Planning Commission. At any point in the application review process, the zoning administrator may transfer his or her decision-making authority to the planning commission at his/her discretion because of policy implications, unique or unusual circumstances, or the magnitude of the project. Decisions referred to the planning commission shall be considered at a noticed public hearing. A referral under this section to another decision-maker is not an appeal and requires no appeal application or fee.

B.    Call for Review. Any decision of the zoning administrator may be called up for review by a planning commissioner or city council member. Any decision of the planning commission may be called up for review by a city council member. If council members or planning commissioners request review, there is a presumption that the reason for the review is that the action has significant and material effects on the quality of life within the city. No inference of bias shall be made or implied due to such a request for review being filed.

C.    Filing an Appeal or Call for Review. All appeals shall be submitted in writing, identifying the determination or action being appealed and specifically stating the basis or grounds of the appeal. Appeals shall be filed within ten days following the date of determination or action for which an appeal is made, accompanied by a filing fee established by city council resolution, and submitted to the city clerk. A call for review shall be filed with the zoning administrator and/or city clerk.

D.    Notice and Schedule of Appeal Hearings and Calls for Review. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the person filing the appeal and the applicant, appeal hearings and calls for review should be conducted within thirty days from the date of appeal submittal. Notice of hearing for the appeal shall be provided pursuant to noticing requirements of Section 17.16.050, Public hearing and public notice.

E.    Appeal Hearing and Action. Each appeal and call for review shall be considered a de novo (new) hearing. In taking its action on an appeal, the appeal or review authority shall state the basis for its action. The appeal or review authority may act to confirm, modify, reverse the action of the approving authority, in whole or in part, or add or amend such conditions as it deems necessary. The action of the appeal or review authority is final on the date of decision and, unless expressly provided by this chapter, may not be further appealed. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.16.090 Effective date.
Generally, the action to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a permit or entitlement authorized by this title shall be effective ten calendar days after the date of action, immediately following expiration of the ten-day appeal period. Legislative actions by the city council (e.g., zoning amendment, general plan amendment, specific plans, and development agreements) become effective thirty days from the date of final action and may not be appealed. Permit(s) shall not be issued until the effective date of required permit. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.16.100 Permit time limits, extensions, and expiration.
A.    Time Limits. Unless a condition of approval or other provision of this title establishes a different time limit, any permit not exercised within one year of approval shall expire and become void, except where an extension of time is approved pursuant to this section.

B.    Exercising Permits. The exercise of a permit occurs when the property owner has performed substantial work as determined by the zoning administrator and the building official and incurred substantial liabilities in good faith reliance on the building permit. A permit may be otherwise exercised pursuant to a condition of the permit or corresponding legal agreement that specifies that other substantial efforts or expenditures constitute exercise of the permit. Unless otherwise provided, permits that have not been exercised prior to a zoning amendment, which would make the permitted use or structure nonconforming, shall automatically be deemed invalid on the effective date of the zoning amendment.

C.    Permit Extensions. The approval of an extension extends the expiration date for up to two years from the original permit date.

1.    Process. The same approving authority that granted the original permit may extend the period within which the exercise of a permit must occur. Notice and/or public hearing shall be provided in the same manner as for the original permit. An application for extension shall be filed not less than thirty days prior to the expiration date of the permit, along with appropriate fees and application submittal materials.

2.    Conditions. The permit, as extended, may be conditioned to comply with any development standards that may have been enacted since the permit was initially approved.

3.    Permit Extension Findings. The extension may be granted only when the designated approving authority finds that the original permit findings can still be made and there are no changed circumstances or there has been diligent pursuit to exercise the permit that warrants such extension.

4.    Expiration. If the time limits are reached with no extension requested, or a requested extension is denied or expires, the permit expires.

D.    Permit Expiration for a Closed Business. All permits and entitlements shall expire when a business is closed for more than one calendar year. Approval of new permits and entitlements based on current requirements shall be required prior to any business activity on the site. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.16.110 Modification.
Any person holding a permit granted under this title may request a modification or amendment to that permit. For the purpose of this section, the modification of a permit may include modification of the terms of the permit itself, project design, or the waiver or alteration of conditions imposed in the granting of the permit. Fees for such application shall be as set forth by resolution of the city council.

If the zoning administrator determines that a proposed project action is not in substantial conformance with the original approval, the zoning administrator shall notify the property owner of the requirement to submit a permit modification application for consideration and action by the same approving authority as the original permit. A permit modification may be granted only when the approving authority makes all findings required for the original approval. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.16.120 Revocation.
This section provides procedures for the revocation of previously approved land use entitlements or permits.

A.    Consideration. The approving authority for the original entitlement or permit shall consider the revocation of same entitlement or permit.

B.    Noticed Public Hearing. The decision to revoke an entitlement or permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this title shall be considered at a noticed public hearing. Public notice shall be provided and a public hearing conducted pursuant to Section 17.16.050, Public hearing and public notice.

C.    Findings. A decision to revoke an entitlement or permit may be made if any one of the following findings can be made:

1.    Circumstances under which the entitlement or permit was granted have been changed to a degree that one or more of the findings contained in the original entitlement or permit can no longer be met.

2.    The entitlement or permit was issued, in whole or in part, on the basis of a misrepresentation or omission of a material statement in the application, or in the evidence presented during the public hearing, for the entitlement or permit.

3.    One or more of the conditions of the entitlement or permit have not been substantially fulfilled or have been violated.

4.    The use or structure for which the entitlement or permit was granted has ceased to exist or has lost its legal nonconforming use status.

5.    The improvement authorized in compliance with the entitlement or permit is in violation of any code, law, ordinance, regulation, or statute.

6.    The improvement or use allowed by the entitlement or permit has become detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or the manner of operation constitutes or is creating a public nuisance. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.16.130 Reapplications.
An application shall not be accepted or acted upon if within the past twelve months the city has denied an application for substantially the same project on substantially the same real property, unless the zoning administrator finds one or more of the following circumstances to exist:

A.    New Evidence. There is new evidence that would support approving the project that was not presented at the previous hearing and could not have been previously discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence by the applicant.

B.    Substantial and Permanent Change of Circumstances. There has been a substantial and material change of circumstances since the previous hearing that affects the applicant’s real property.

C.    Mistake at Previous Hearing. A mistake was made at the previous hearing that was a material factor in the denial of the previous application. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.010 Purpose and applicability.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for land use permits and entitlements that are decided administratively by city staff or the zoning administrator. Each permit and entitlement type is described in this chapter in terms of purpose and applicability, approving authority, and unique processing provisions. Exemptions to permit requirements are listed throughout. General processing procedures are established in Chapter 17.16, General Application Processing Procedures. Table 17.16-A—Approving Authority for Land Use Entitlements provides a summary of the permits and entitlements decided by the zoning administrator and indicates whether the decision may be appealed. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.020 Plan check/zoning clearance.
A.    Purpose. The plan check/zoning clearance process is to ensure that all new and modified uses and structures comply with applicable provisions of this code, using administrative procedures and thorough but typically “over-the-counter” planning approvals for building permits, and other city applications that require approval from a different city department and can be processed by the planning department in a relatively short time period.

B.    Applicability. Plan check/zoning clearance is required for the following actions:

1.    All structures that require a building permit.

2.    All planning entitlement and permit approvals to ensure compliance with applicable conditions of approval.

3.    Other city applications that may be subject to the provisions of this title, including but not limited to encroachment and grading and improvement plans.

C.    Review Process. Processed along with related city action, such as building permit application.

D.    Findings. Plan check/zoning clearance shall be granted only when the zoning administrator finds the proposal to be in conformance with all applicable provisions of this title.

E.    Compliance Requirements. The zoning administrator may impose requirements in order to ensure compliance with this title and to prevent adverse or detrimental impact to the surrounding neighborhood. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.030 Official code interpretation.
A.    Purpose and Applicability. The zoning ordinance may require an official interpretation when it is not clear what provisions may apply. This includes when a specific use is not listed and it is unclear whether the use is permitted, permitted with a use permit, or not permitted.

B.    Review Process.

1.    An official code interpretation can be initiated by staff or the public using an application provided by the planning department.

2.    The zoning administrator shall prepare an official code interpretation.

3.    A notice of decision shall be provided according to the provision of Section 17.16.060, Notice of zoning administrator decisions.

4.    Official code interpretation may be referred to the planning commission by the zoning administrator or may be appealed.

C.    Findings. The zoning administrator shall make an official code interpretation allowing a use only after finding all of the following:

1.    The characteristics of and activities associated with the proposed interpretation will not involve a higher level of activity, environmental impact, or population density than intended for the zoning district.

2.    The interpretation is not otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the applicable zoning district.

3.    Any proposed use will be consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan, and the zoning ordinance.

D.    Record of Interpretations. Interpretations shall be made in writing and shall contain the facts that support the interpretation. The planning department shall maintain all such interpretations on record for review by the general public upon request. The notice of decision shall be provided, in writing, to the applicant, interested parties, and property owners within three hundred feet. The notice shall include:

1.    A brief statement explaining the criteria and standards considered relevant to the decision.

2.    A statement of the standards and facts relied upon in rendering the decision.

3.    An explanation of appeal rights and appeal deadlines. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.040 Similar use determination.
A.    Purpose. The land use table may not include all possible uses. When a specific use is not listed and it is unclear whether the use is permitted, the similar use determination allows the zoning administrator to determine whether or not a proposed use is similar to a listed use and whether it may be permitted in a particular zoning district.

B.    Applicability. A similar use determination is required when a use is not specifically listed in this zoning code but may be permitted if it is determined to be similar in nature to a permitted or conditionally permitted use.

C.    Approval Findings. The zoning administrator shall make a similar use determination after finding all of the following. If the zoning administrator does not make all of these findings, he/she shall not make the similar use determination.

1.    The characteristics of and activities associated with the proposed use are equivalent to one or more of the listed uses and will not involve a higher level of activity, environmental impact, or population density than the uses listed in the zoning district.

2.    The proposed use will be consistent with the purposes of the applicable zoning district.

3.    The proposed use will be consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan, and the zoning code.

D.    Determinations. Determinations shall be made in writing and shall contain the facts that support the determination. The planning department shall maintain all such determinations on record for review by the general public upon request. The notice of decision shall be provided, in writing, to the applicant and interested parties. The notice shall include:

1.    A brief statement explaining the criteria and standards considered relevant to the decision.

2.    A statement of the standards and facts relied upon in rendering the decision.

3.    An explanation of appeal rights and appeal deadlines.

E.    Procedure. A notice of decision shall be provided according to Section 17.16.060, Notice of zoning administrator decisions. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.050 Home occupation permit.
A.    Purpose. The requirement of a home occupation permit ensures that home occupations in residential neighborhoods are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood character. The zoning administrator is authorized to approve, impose reasonable conditions upon such approval, or deny home occupation permits.

B.    Applicability. A home occupation permit shall be required for all home occupations.

C.    Review Process.

1.    Applications for a home occupation shall be submitted on forms provided by the planning department along with the applicable fee established by city council resolution.

2.    Upon acceptance of a home occupation application, the zoning administrator or a designated representative shall review the request for compliance with development standards related to the proposed activities and render a decision within a five-day review period. The decision shall clearly state, in writing, any conditions of approval or reasons for denial.

3.    Immediately following the effective date of an approved home occupation, the applicant shall obtain a city business license.

4.    Relocation of a Home Occupation. If a home occupation relocates, a new permit and review shall be required for the new location.

D.    Findings. A home occupation permit shall be granted only when the zoning administrator determines that the proposed home occupation complies with all of the following findings:

1.    The proposed home occupation is consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan or planned community, and all applicable provisions of this title.

2.    The proposed home occupation is consistent with the development standards for home occupations shown in this section.

3.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the home occupation applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case (location, size, design, and operating characteristics), be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such use or to the general welfare of the city.

4.    All required county, regional, state, or federal permits have been obtained.

E.    Compliance Requirements. The zoning administrator may impose requirements, and/or require guarantees in order to ensure compliance with this title and to prevent adverse or detrimental impact to the surrounding neighborhood. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.060 Temporary use permit.
A.    Purpose. Temporary use permits provide a process for administrative review for short-term activities that may not meet the normal development or use standards of the applicable zoning district, but may be acceptable because of their temporary nature. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the temporary use does not adversely impact the long-term uses of the same or neighboring sites, or impact the general health, safety, and welfare of persons residing within the community.

B.    Applicability. A temporary use permit shall be required prior to the establishment of those uses specified in Chapter 17.64, Temporary Uses. Temporary use permits will be reviewed for compliance with development standards related to those activities provided in Chapter 17.64, Temporary Uses, and as set forth below.

C.    Review Process. An application for a temporary use permit shall be submitted on forms provided by the planning department along with the applicable fee established by city council.

D.    Findings. A temporary use permit shall be granted when the zoning administrator determines that the use complies with the following findings:

1.    The proposed temporary use is consistent with the general plan and any other applicable specific plan, and all applicable provisions of the city ordinance.

2.    The establishment and operation of the temporary use will not, under the particular circumstances of the use (location, size, duration, operational characteristics, design), be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons or businesses residing or working in the vicinity of the activity, or in the city as a whole.

E.    Compliance Requirements. The zoning administrator may impose requirements, conditions and/or require guarantees in order to ensure compliance with this title, and/or to prevent adverse or detrimental impact to the surrounding area. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.070 Minor adjustment.
A.    Purpose. Adjustments may be needed to certain provisions to allow creative design solutions and to accommodate unique site conditions.

B.    Applicability. A minor adjustment may be granted to modify certain requirements of this code, as listed in Table 17.18-A—Standards Subject to Minor Adjustment. Adjustments do not apply to land use and are not intended to waive a specific prohibition or procedural requirement. Additionally, a minor adjustment may be granted for exemptions from development standards for the repurposing or reuse of industrial warehouse and other large footprint buildings for alternative uses not envisioned when the structure was originally built.

1.    The proposed development is of sufficient size and is designed so as to provide a desirable environment within its own boundaries.

2.    The proposed development is compatible with existing and proposed land uses in the surrounding area.

3.    Any exceptions to or deviations from the density, requirements, or design standards result in the creation of project amenities that would not be available through strict adherence to code provisions (e.g., additional open space, protection of natural resources, improved pedestrian connectivity, public plazas). All minor adjustments shall be consistent with density bonus provisions outlined in Section 17.60.020, Density bonus and other incentives.

4.    Granting the minor adjustment will not adversely affect the interests of the public or the interests of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the premises in question.

5.    The minor adjustment is consistent with the general plan or any applicable specific plan or development agreement.

6.    The exception is the minimum required in that it allows the specified improvement or development to occur, but does not provide additional development rights.

F.    Conditions. In approving a minor adjustment, the zoning administrator may impose any reasonable conditions to ensure that the approval will comply with the findings required, as well as any performance criteria and development standards contained within this code. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.080 Administrative use permit.
A.    Purpose. An administrative use permit provides a process for zoning administrator review and determination of requests for uses and activities whose effects on adjacent sites and surroundings need to be evaluated in terms of specific development proposal for the specific site. It is anticipated that uses qualifying for an administrative use permit are minor in nature, only have an impact on immediately adjacent properties, and can be modified and/or conditioned to ensure compatibility.

B.    Applicability. This section applies to land use requiring an administrative use review as designated with an “A” on the allowed use tables.

C.    Review Process.

1.    The zoning administrator is the approving authority for administrative use permits. However, the zoning administrator may also refer an administrative use permit to the planning commission for review and approval.

2.    Notice of the determination shall be made in accordance with Section 17.16.060, Notice of zoning administrator decisions.

3.    Zoning administrator determination shall be based on standards and criteria set forth within this title and shall be accompanied by brief, written findings and a determination.

D.    Findings. The zoning administrator shall approve, or approve with conditions, an application for an administrative use review after making all of these findings. If the zoning administrator does not make all of these findings, he/she shall deny the administrative use permit.

1.    The proposed use is allowed within the applicable zoning district and complies with all other applicable provisions of this zoning ordinance, municipal code, general plan, and any applicable specific plans or city regulations/standards.

2.    The site is physically suited for the type, density, and intensity of the proposed use, including access, utilities, and the absence of physical constraints, and can be conditioned to meet all related performance criteria and development standards.

3.    Granting the permit would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare, or materially injurious to persons, property, or improvements in the vicinity in which the project is located.

E.    Conditions. In approving an administrative use permit, the zoning administrator may impose any reasonable conditions to ensure that the approval will comply with the findings required, as well as any performance criteria and development standards contained within this code. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.18.090 Minor design review.
A.    Purpose and Applicability. This section establishes a minor design review process for less significant projects as an alternative to the major design review process (Section 17.20.030), for the following projects:

1.    Selected Residential Development. Design review for the following residential development shall be conducted by the zoning administrator unless a conditional use permit or other approval is otherwise required by the planning commission:

a.    New single-family and two-family residences and additions of one hundred twenty-one square feet or more.

b.    Multiple-family residences with four or fewer units.

2.    Commercial Development. Minor design review, using the commercial design guidelines, shall be required for commercial development in all zoning districts.

3.    Industrial Development. Minor design review, using the industrial design guidelines, shall be required for industrial development in all zoning districts.

4.    Signs. Minor design review is required for non-exempt signs identified in Chapter 18.04, Regulatory Sign Ordinance. Signs that involve public policy issues may be referred to the planning commission.

5.    Walls and Fences. Minor design review is required for nonexempt walls and fences required by Chapter 17.45, Fences, Walls, Gates, and Screening, in a commercial, industrial, or multifamily development.

B.    Review Process and Approving Authority. The zoning administrator is the approving authority for minor design review. However, the zoning administrator may also refer a minor design review to the planning commission for review and approval.

1.    Notice of the determination shall be made in accordance with Section 17.16.060, Notice of zoning administrator decisions.

2.    Zoning administrator determination shall be based on standards and criteria set forth within this title and shall be accompanied by brief, written findings and a determination.

C.    Review Criteria. The zoning administrator shall ensure that the proposed development meets the following requirements:

1.    Design Guidelines. The proposal is consistent with applicable design guidelines.

2.    Community Plans. The proposal is consistent with any community design plan or specific plan.

17.18.100 Reasonable accommodation.
A.    Purpose and Intent. In accordance with federal and state fair housing laws, it is the purpose of this section to allow for reasonable accommodations in the city’s zoning and land use regulations, policies, and practices when needed to provide an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The intent is to alleviate the need for a variance request for a reasonable accommodation as described herein.

B.    Permit Application.

1.    Applicant. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with a disability. A reasonable accommodation may be approved only for the benefit of one or more individuals with a disability.

2.    Application. An application for a reasonable accommodation from a zoning regulation, policy, or practice shall be made on a form specified by the zoning administrator. No fee shall be required for a request for reasonable accommodation, but if the project requires another discretionary permit, then the prescribed fee shall be paid for all other discretionary permits.

3.    Other Discretionary Permits. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval, then the applicant may file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval. The processing procedures of the discretionary permit shall govern the joint processing of both the reasonable accommodation and the discretionary permit.

4.    Required Submittals. In addition to materials required under other applicable provisions of this code, an application for reasonable accommodation shall include the following:

a.    Documentation that the applicant is:

i.    An individual with a disability.

ii.    Applying on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability.

iii.    A developer or provider of housing for one or more individuals with a disability.

b.    The specific exception or modification to the zoning code provision, policy, or practices requested by the applicant.

c.    Documentation that the specific exception or modification requested by the applicant is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the residence.

d.    Any other information that the zoning administrator reasonably concludes is necessary to determine whether a reasonable accommodation is necessary, so long as any request for information regarding the disability of the individuals benefited complies with fair housing law protections and the privacy rights of the individuals affected.

C.    Review Procedure. The zoning administrator is the designated approval authority for reasonable accommodation requests and shall approve a reasonable accommodation request if the compliance requirements below are addressed.

D.    Required Findings. The written decision to approve a request for reasonable accommodation shall be based on the following findings, all of which are required for approval:

1.    The requested accommodation is requested by or on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws.

2.    The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

3.    The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city as “undue financial or administrative burden” is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.

4.    The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city’s zoning program, as “fundamental alteration” is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.

5.    The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others.

E.    Conditions. The zoning administrator is authorized to approve or deny applications and to impose reasonable conditions upon such approval, as the administrator may deem necessary to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses, to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare.

F.    Alternative Reasonable Accommodations. The decision-maker may approve alternative reasonable accommodations that provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant.

G.    Balancing Rights and Requirements. The city will attempt to balance (1) the privacy rights and reasonable request of an applicant for confidentiality with (2) the land use requirements for notice and public hearing, factual findings and rights to appeal in the city’s requests for information, consideration of application, preparing written findings and maintaining records for a request for reasonable accommodation.

H.    Consideration Factors. The city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling:

1.    Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of life of one or more individuals with a disability.

2.    Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation.

3.    In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and market participants.

4.    In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to live in a residential setting.

I.    Consideration Factors—Fundamental Alteration to Zoning Program. The city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city’s zoning program:

1.    Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood.

2.    Whether the requested accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking.

3.    Whether the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either the city’s general plan or an applicable specific plan.

4.    In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation.

J.    Rules While Decision Is Pending. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect.

K.    Effective Date. No reasonable accommodation shall become effective until the decision to grant such accommodation shall have become final by reason of the expiration of time to make an appeal. In the event an appeal is filed, the reasonable accommodation shall not become effective unless and until a decision is made by the city council on such appeal, pursuant to the provisions of this section.

L.    Expiration. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this chapter shall expire within one year from the effective date of approval or at an alternative time specified as a condition of approval unless:

1.    A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced.

2.    A certificate of occupancy has been issued.

3.    Occupancy of dwelling has occurred.

4.    A time extension has been granted.

M.    Time Extension. The zoning administrator may approve a single one-year time extension for a reasonable accommodation for good cause. An application for a time extension shall be made in writing to the zoning administrator no less than thirty days prior to the expiration date. The request for an extension shall be subject to the same notice, hearing, and appeal requirements applicable to the original application.

N.    Violation of Terms. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this title may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such reasonable accommodation are violated, or if any law or ordinance is violated in connection therewith. Revocation of a reasonable accommodation shall be subject to the same notice, hearing, and appeal requirements applicable to the original application.

O.    Discontinuance. A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is discontinued for one hundred eighty consecutive days. If the persons initially occupying a residence vacate, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the zoning administrator determines that: (1) the modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the zoning code, or (2) the accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual an equal opportunity to enjoy the dwelling. The zoning administrator may request the applicant or his or her successor in interest to the property to provide documentation that subsequent occupants are persons with disabilities. Failure to provide such documentation within ten days of the date of a request by the city shall constitute grounds for discontinuance by the city of a previously approved reasonable accommodation.

P.    Revocation. Any revocation shall be noticed and heard pursuant to the procedures established in Section 17.16.120, Revocation.

Q.    Amendments. A request for changes in conditions of approval of a reasonable accommodation, or a change to plans that would affect a condition of approval, shall be treated as a new application. The zoning administrator may waive the requirement for a new application if the changes are minor, do not involve substantial alterations or additions to the plan or the conditions of approval, and are consistent with the intent of the original approval.

The following components are required for annual review:

1.    Staff Report. Prior to each review, the planning department shall prepare a report relative to all development that has occurred under the agreement subsequent to the last past review and any other relevant matters.

2.    Compliance. If the planning department review determines that all terms and conditions of the agreement have been met, and the city manager concurs in writing, no further review shall be required.

3.    Recommendation for Modification or Termination. If the planning department report recommends modification or termination of the agreement, or if the city manager proposes to make such a recommendation to the city council, a public hearing shall be scheduled before the planning commission on the agreement if such modifications are major or involve land use changes. Notice of intention to modify or terminate the agreement shall be given in the same manner as set forth in Section 17.16.050, Public hearing and public notice. At a public hearing the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating his or her good faith compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement.

4.    Decision on Modification or Termination. Upon receipt of the planning commission’s recommendation, the city council shall schedule a public hearing. Notice of intention to modify or terminate the agreement shall be given in the same manner as set forth in Section 17.16.050, Public hearing and public notice. If, after the public hearing is closed, the city council finds and determines on the basis of substantial evidence that the applicant or its successor in interest has not complied in good faith with the terms and conditions of the agreement, the city council may modify or terminate the agreement. Any modification or termination is subject to the provisions of Section 17.16.110, Modification.

G.    Application of Existing Rules, Standards, and Policies. Unless otherwise provided by the development agreement, rules, standards, and official policies applicable to development of the property subject to a development agreement shall be those rules, standards, and official policies in force at the time of execution of the agreement. A development agreement shall not prevent the city, in subsequent actions applicable to the property, from applying new rules, standards, and policies which do not conflict with those rules, standards, and policies applicable to the property as set forth herein, nor shall a development agreement prevent the city from denying or conditionally approving any subsequent development project application on the basis of such existing or new rules, standards, and policies. No rights shall be deemed to vest in the applicant, or any other person, under any development agreement, except as expressly set forth in the development agreement.

H.    Modification or Termination. All agreement provisions are subject to modification or suspension as set forth in the California Government Code, commencing with Section 65864.

I.    Recording. No later than ten days after the city and applicant have executed the agreement, the city clerk shall record with the county recorder a copy of the agreement. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.22.030 Specific plan.
A     Purpose. The purpose of a specific plan is to provide a vehicle for implementing the city’s general plan on an area-specific basis. The specific plan serves as a regulatory document, consistent with the general plan. In the event there is an inconsistency or conflict between an adopted specific plan and comparable provisions of this title, the specific plan shall prevail. This section describes the process for adopting and amending specific plans and approving subsequent development under a specific plan.

B.    Applicability. The general plan identifies certain new development areas of the city which require a specific plan or master plan (planned development) to implement general plan policies. Specific plans are also encouraged if they will lead to more effective implementation of the general plan.

C.    Special Review Procedures. The designated approving authority for a specific plan is the city council, which shall hold a public hearing on the planning commission recommendation prior to taking action. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing and then shall provide a recommendation, which shall include the reasons for the recommendation and the relationship of the proposal to the general plan. The city council approves by ordinance or denies the specific plan in accordance with the requirements of this title.

D.    Specific Plan Amendment. An amendment to specific plan text and map may be initiated by the planning commission or the city council, or may be initiated by the original applicant for the specific plan district or a successor thereto, provided such applicant or successor has, at the time of application for an amendment, a continuing controlling interest in development or management of uses within the planned community zone.

9.    Any other programs, guidelines, or standards appropriate for the area covered by the specific plan.

F.    Environmental Review. The majority of specific plans will require the preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) under CEQA and its guidelines. Once certified, the EIR for a specific plan may be relied upon for further entitlements sought subsequent to adoption of the specific plan. Unless otherwise exempt, an initial study shall be prepared for all subsequent applications to determine whether a supplement to the EIR must be prepared. In the event that a supplement to the EIR is determined not to be necessary, a negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration shall be prepared.

C.    Initiation. An amendment may be initiated as prescribed in this section.

1.    Petition. An amendment may be initiated by the verified petition of one or more owners of the property affected by the proposed amendments, which shall be filed with the planning commission and shall be accompanied by a fee as prescribed in Chapter 17.06, Fees.

2.    City Council. An amendment may be initiated by resolution of intention of the city council.

3.    Planning Commission. An amendment may be initiated by resolution of intention by the planning commission.

4.    City Staff. City may initiate an amendment to the zoning ordinance for consideration by the planning commission and recommendation to city council for adoption.

17.22.050 General plan amendment.
A.    Purpose. The purpose of a general plan amendment is to allow for modifications to the general plan text (e.g., goals, policies, or implementation programs) or to change the general plan land use designation on any parcel(s).

B.    Special Review Procedures. The designated approving authority for general plan amendments is the city council, which shall hold a public hearing prior to taking action. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing and provide a recommendation. The city council approves by resolution or denies the general plan amendment in accordance with the requirements of this title.

C.    Frequency of Amendment. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65358, no mandatory element of the general plan may be amended more frequently than four times during any calendar year.

D.    Initiation of Amendment. A general plan amendment may be initiated by the planning commission or the city council, by application of the property owner(s) of the parcel(s) to be affected by the general plan amendment, or by recommendation of the zoning administrator to clarify text, address changes mandated by state law, maintain internal general plan consistency, address boundary adjustments affecting land use designation(s), or for any other reason beneficial to the city.

E.    Findings. The city council may approve a general plan amendment upon finding that the amendment is in the public interest and that the general plan as amended will remain internally consistent. In the event that a general plan amendment is requested by a private property owner, the applicant shall demonstrate to the city council that there is a substantial public benefit to be derived from such amendment and how the proposed amendment furthers the goals of the general plan. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.22.060 Prezoning.
A.    Purpose. The purpose of prezoning is to establish the designation of land uses for unincorporated property adjoining the city, within the sphere of influence, prior to annexation.

B.    Process. The method of accomplishing prezoning shall be the same as for a zoning amendment. Such zoning shall become effective at the time annexation becomes effective. Upon passage of an ordinance establishing the applicable pre-district designation for property outside the city, the zoning map shall be revised to show the potential or “pre-district” classification to become effective upon annexation.

CLASSIFICATION OF USES
Sections:

17.30.010    Classification of uses.

17.30.020    Categories and use descriptions.

17.30.030    Rules applicable to use classifications.

17.30.040    Temporary uses.

17.30.010 Classification of uses.
In order to simplify land use regulations used throughout this title, the city has established a “use classification” system to group individual land use listings into general categories on the basis of common function, product, or compatibility characteristics. Use classifications describe one or more uses having similar characteristics but do not list every use or activity that may appropriately be within the classification. For example, “personal service use” includes a wide range of individual personal service uses (e.g., beauty parlor, dry cleaning, tanning salons, tailors). Rather than listing all such uses individually throughout this title, “personal service use” is listed once. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.30.020 Categories and use descriptions.
A.    Use classifications established for the city of San Pablo are organized into the six categories below. Descriptions of each use classification in these categories are provided in Division VI, Glossary.

1.    Residential use classes.

2.    Recreation, resource preservation, open space, education, and public assembly use classes.

3.    Utility, transportation, public facility, and communication use classes.

4.    Retail, service, and office use classes.

5.    Automobile and vehicle use classes.

6.    Industrial, manufacturing, and processing uses. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.30.030 Rules applicable to use classifications.
The following rules apply to use classifications:

A.    Specific Use Regulations. Additional use regulations for specific land uses are listed in Division V, Special Use Requirements.

B.    Uses Not Listed. Land uses that are not listed in the zoning district tables are not allowed, except as otherwise provided for in this title.

C.    Illegal Uses. No use that is illegal under local, state, or federal law shall be allowed in any zoning district within the city.

D.    Similar Uses. When a use is not specifically listed in this title, it shall be understood that the use may be permitted if the zoning administrator determines that the use is substantially similar to other uses listed based on established criteria and required findings outlined in Section 17.18.040, Similar use determination. It is further recognized that every conceivable use cannot be identified in this title and, anticipating that new uses will evolve over time, the zoning administrator may make a similar use determination to compare a proposed use and measure it against those uses listed. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.30.040 Temporary uses.
Generally, use classifications identify primary and longer-term use of property. Temporary uses which are incidental to the primary use and/or limited term in nature are listed and regulated in Chapter 17.64, Temporary Uses. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.32.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to define allowable land uses and property development standards, including intensity of development, for the residential zoning districts in order to produce healthy, safe, and attractive neighborhoods in San Pablo, consistent with the policy direction in the San Pablo general plan. The intent of each of the residential zoning districts is described below. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.32.020 Intent of individual districts.
A.    R-1 District. The R-1 single-family residential district is intended to implement the single-family residential land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities for single-family homes on individual parcels. The maximum density ordinarily allowable in this district is twelve dwelling units per acre. Secondary residential units and accessory uses are also allowed.

B.    R-2 District. The R-2 two-family residential district is intended to implement the medium-density multifamily residential land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities for single-family and two-family homes (duplexes). The maximum density allowable in this district is eighteen dwelling units per acre. Accessory uses are also allowed.

C.    R-3 District. The R-3 multifamily residential district is intended to implement the medium-density multifamily residential land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities for residential development characterized by a mix of housing types, including townhouses, apartments, and condominiums. The maximum density allowable in this district is twenty-four dwelling units per acre. Accessory uses are also allowed.

D.    R-4 District. The R-4 high-density multifamily residential district is intended to implement the high-density multifamily residential land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities in select locations, such as near transit stops or neighborhood retail centers, for residential development characterized by a mix of housing types, including single-family homes, two-family homes, townhouses, apartments, and condominiums. The maximum density allowable in this district is forty-eight dwelling units per acre. Accessory uses are also allowed.

E.    RMU District. The RMU residential mixed-use district is intended to implement the residential mixed-use land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities for mixed-use development that includes residential, office, and retail uses. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 1.5 and the maximum residential density (included within the overall FAR limits) is fifty units per gross acre. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.32.030 Uses allowed.
A.    Matrix of Uses. Table 17.32-A—Residential Districts: Use Regulations contains the use regulations for the residential zoning districts, listed by class of uses as defined in Division VI, Glossary. The allowable uses in Table 17.32-A for each district are established by letter designations as follows:

1.    “R” designates classes of uses permitted by right.

2.    “A” designates classes of uses that require an administrative review pursuant to Section 17.18.020, Plan check/zoning clearance.

3.    “U” designates classes of uses permitted with a use permit pursuant to Section 17.20.040, Conditional use permit.

4.    “–” designates classes of uses that are prohibited.

5.    Any class of use not listed in Table 17.32-A is prohibited.

B.    Exceptions. Notwithstanding the provisions of Table 17.32-A, the following provisions apply:

1.    Railroad Lines. Any development within three hundred feet of a railroad line that is used at least once daily shall require a use permit to ensure that the development adequately mitigates noise and vibration from the rail operations, pursuant to the relevant policies and actions under the general plan.

2.    Streams. In the absence of any other permit requirement, any development, including land disturbance, that is within fifty feet of any stream shall require an administrative use permit to ensure that the development adequately avoids impacts to wetland features or woodlands, reduces impacts to the creek, and prevents degradation of riparian and wetland features from potential urban pollutants, pursuant to the relevant policies and actions related to creeks within the general plan.

3.    Specific Plans. Development on specific plan areas follow their provisions.

C.    Design Review. Certain uses also require design review. A list of those uses is contained in Section 17.18.090, Minor design review, and Section 17.20.030, Major design review.

D.    Principal Uses Only. Only principal uses are listed in Table 17.32-A—Residential Districts: Use Regulations. Accessory uses are addressed in Section 17.32.080, Accessory uses.

E.    Other Regulations. Some uses are also subject to other titles of the San Pablo Municipal Code. Those provisions are in addition to the provisions in this chapter.

F.    Special Provisions. Special provisions related to a use are referenced in the special provisions column of Table 17.32-A—Residential Districts: Use Regulations.

17.34.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to define allowable land uses and property development standards, including intensity of development, for the commercial zoning districts and to permit a variety of industrial activities, with a focus on encouraging employment opportunities and clean industry, consistent with the policy direction in the San Pablo general plan. The commercial districts are intended to provide services to residents, support mixed-use development, and attract retail expenditures from outside San Pablo, consistent with the policy direction in the general plan. The intent of each of the commercial and industrial zoning districts is described below. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.020 Intent of individual districts.
A.    NC District. The NC neighborhood commercial district is intended to implement the commercial land use designation in the general plan by providing small-scale commercial uses that primarily provide convenience, personal services, and social services such as retail and specialty shops, eating and drinking establishments, and commercial recreation. The maximum permitted floor area ratio is 1.0.

B.    CR District. The CR regional commercial district is intended to implement the commercial land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities for uses, such as malls, major department stores, factory outlet stores, and home improvement stores, that serve a very large geographic area. The CR districts are to be located where there is adequate vehicular access to regional markets. Other types of commercial uses are also encouraged, provided they are compatible with the regional uses. The maximum permitted floor area ratio is 0.75 for office uses and 0.40 for non-office uses.

C.    CMU District. The CMU commercial mixed-use district is intended to implement the commercial mixed-use land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities for retail, commercial, office, residential, and public uses. While the predominant development use is commercial, the city encourages the vertical and/or horizontal integration of office, residential, and/or public uses that are compatible with the commercial development. In multiple-story buildings, retail uses should be predominant on the ground floor. The maximum permitted floor area ratio is 1.5. The maximum density allowable in the district is fifty dwelling units per acre.

D.    IMU District. The IMU industrial mixed-use district is intended to implement the industrial mixed-use land use designation in the general plan by providing opportunities for light manufacturing, distribution, sales, and services with ancillary commercial and office space uses. Targeted uses include single- and multi-story office, flex-space, and industrial buildings for single and multiple users, warehousing, and research and development facilities. Retail uses are not permitted. The maximum permitted floor area ratio is 0.6. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.030 Uses allowed.
A.    Matrix of Uses. Table 17.34-A contains the use regulations for the commercial zoning districts, listed by classes of uses as defined in Division VI, Glossary. The allowable uses in Table 17.34-A for each district are established by letter designations as follows:

1.    “R” designates classes of uses permitted by right.

2.    “A” designates classes of uses that require an administrative review pursuant to Section 17.18.020, Plan check/zoning clearance.

3.    “U” designates classes of uses permitted with a use permit pursuant to Section 17.20.040, Conditional use permit.

4.    “–” designates classes of uses that are prohibited.

5.    Any class of use not listed in Table 17.34-A is prohibited.

6.    The zoning administrator shall determine if a use is classified as an allowed use.

B.    Exceptions along Railroad Lines and Streams. Notwithstanding the provisions of Table 17.34-A, the following provisions apply:

1.    Any development, except industry—limited, industry—general, and salvage yards, within three hundred feet of a railroad line that is used at least once daily shall require a use permit to ensure that the development adequately mitigates noise and vibration from the rail operations, pursuant to the relevant policies and actions under the general plan.

2.    Any development, including land disturbance, that is within fifty feet of any stream shall require a use permit to ensure that the development adequately avoids impacts to wetland features or woodlands, reduces impacts to the creek, and prevents degradation of riparian and wetland features from potential urban pollutants, pursuant to the relevant policies and actions related to creeks within the general plan.

C.    Design Review. Certain uses also require design review. A list of those uses is contained in Section 17.18.090, Minor design review, and Section 17.20.030, Major design review.

D.    Principal Uses Only. Only principal uses are listed in Table 17.34-A. Accessory uses are addressed in Section 17.34.070, Accessory uses.

E.    Other Regulations. Some uses are also subject to the provisions of Title 5 and other titles of the San Pablo Municipal Code. Those provisions are in addition to the provisions in this chapter.

F.    Special Provisions. Special provisions related to a use are referenced in the special provisions column of Table 17.34-A.

17.34.050 Residential uses.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the following provisions apply to residential uses allowed pursuant to the planned development procedure:

A.    Density. Residential dwelling units in a commercial district shall not exceed one dwelling unit per two thousand five hundred square feet of parcel size unless otherwise permitted in a specific plan.

B.    Development Standards. Residential dwelling units in a commercial district shall comply with the development standards set forth in Chapter 17.32, Residential Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Standards, or in Section 17.34.040, Development standards, whichever are more restrictive.

C.    In Combination with Other Uses. If residential dwelling units are combined within one building or project site with nonresidential uses allowed by Section 17.34.030, Uses allowed, the following provisions shall apply:

1.    The residential and nonresidential uses shall be determined to be compatible.

2.    The nonresidential uses shall be at ground level along the street frontage(s).

3.    The number of dwelling units shall not exceed one dwelling unit per two thousand square feet of parcel size.

4.    The floor area ratio of a mixed-use residential and nonresidential building shall not exceed 0.75. The building shall comply with the height and setback requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.060 Noncommercial uses.
A.    Presumption Against. In the event of an application for a use permit for a project involving a noncommercial use located in a commercial district, the general welfare of the city requires that the application be denied unless the planning commission finds that the particular use will not be detrimental to the long-term economic vitality of the commercial district and/or to neighboring commercial uses.

B.    Findings. In addition to any other finding which may lawfully be required for a use permit, the planning commission and/or city council shall make the following findings before approving a use permit subject to this section:

1.    The proposed use will not adversely impact the city’s existing supply of land, structures, or sites that are particularly suitable for future commercial development.

2.    The requested use at the location proposed will not be materially detrimental to existing or future commercial uses in the same general area.

3.    The proposed use will not encourage marginal commercial development in the same general area.

4.    The proposed use is substantially compatible with existing and likely future commercial developments in the same general area. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.070 Accessory uses.
Accessory uses normally incidental to the type of principal use located on the parcel are allowed. In case of dispute, the zoning administrator shall determine if a use is an accessory or a principal use.

A.    Massage establishments are allowed when subordinate to or part of a principal use in the same facility and serving a use incidental to such principal use only in dance and fitness studios, a nail salon, as a service ancillary thereto when provided by a massage therapist with a valid permit under Chapter 5.36. Accessory uses shall comply with the requirements set forth in Chapter 17.42, Accessory Structures.

B.    In no instance shall advertising, signs, or any other display relating to the availability of massage services be visible from the exterior of the building. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.080 Commercial design guidelines.
The commercial design guidelines in Appendix B are not a mandatory part of the zoning ordinance. The guidelines may, however, be imposed as conditions of approval, provided the applicable approval process allows for conditions to be imposed. Their primary purpose is to serve as a guide during the review, including design review, of a proposed development. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.090 Neighborhood commercial centers.
Neighborhood commercial centers are encouraged by the general plan at particular locations near primary street intersections in all overlay districts, except the Giant Trade Center Business Park district. Neighborhood centers are intended to meet the daily needs of the immediate population, including but not limited to housing, grocery and convenience stores, salons, offices, food and beverage sales, drugstores, dry cleaners, banks, community and cultural facilities, and recreation. Development incentives for the creation of mixed-use neighborhood commercial centers are contained in Section 17.34.100, FAR development incentives. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.100 FAR development incentives.
A.    FAR Increase. Properties within commercial districts or commercial projects, regardless of location, may be developed at a FAR of up to 0.75, if one or more of the following conditions are met:

1.    The project provides public amenities and facility improvements such as open space and multiple (mixed) uses which serve to distinguish the development area as unique, consistent with the general plan;

2.    The project incorporates feasible shared parking with adjacent or nearby development; or

3.    The project consolidates parcels to facilitate efficient development, parking, access, and landscaping.

B.    Use Permit Required. Any increase in FAR pursuant to subsection A of this section must be approved by a use permit. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.110 Mixed-use design guidelines.
The mixed-use design guidelines in Appendix D are not a mandatory part of the zoning ordinance. The guidelines may, however, be imposed as conditions of approval, provided the applicable approval process allows for conditions to be imposed. These guidelines are intended to encourage higher-quality, complementary mixed uses, unique design features, and pedestrian amenities, consistent with the general plan. They are designed to be used in conjunction with the design guidelines for residential, commercial, and industrial development. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.34.120 Industrial design guidelines.
The industrial design guidelines in Appendix C are not a mandatory part of the zoning ordinance. The guidelines may, however, be imposed as conditions of approval, provided the applicable approval process allows for conditions to be imposed. Their primary purpose is to serve as a guide during the review, including design review, of a proposed development. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.36.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide locations for uses that support civic, cultural, health, educational, infrastructure, and open space uses for the community, consistent with the policy direction in the San Pablo general plan. The intent of each of the public and semi-public zoning districts is described below. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.36.020 Intent of individual districts.
A.    I District. The I institutional district is intended to implement the public/semi-public land use designation in the general plan by providing for uses such as parks, government administrative offices, schools and school playgrounds, hospitals, convalescent homes, fire stations, public utility stations, post offices, and various types of state and federal facilities. In some situations, other types of complementary uses are allowed with a use permit.

B.    OS District. The OS open space district is intended to implement the open space land use designation in the general plan by providing for non-recreational open space, active recreational open space, creeks, and passive recreational open space. This district is to be applied to lands owned by a public agency. In some situations, other types of complementary uses are allowed with a use permit. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.36.030 Uses allowed.
A.    Matrix of Uses. Table 17.36-A contains the use regulations for the public/semi-public zoning districts, listed by classes of uses as defined in Division VI, Glossary. The allowable uses in Table 17.36-A for each district are established by letter designations as follows:

1.    “R” designates classes of uses permitted by right.

2.    “A” designates classes of uses that require an administrative review pursuant to Section 17.18.020, Plan check/zoning clearance.

3.    “U” designates classes of uses permitted with a use permit pursuant to Section 17.20.040, Conditional use permit.

4.    “–” designates classes of uses that are prohibited.

5.    Any class of use not listed in Table 17.36-A is prohibited.

B.    Exceptions along Railroad Lines and Streams. Notwithstanding the provisions of Table 17.36-A, the following provisions apply:

1.    Any development within three hundred feet of a railroad line that is used at least once daily shall require a use permit to ensure that the development adequately mitigates noise and vibration from the rail operations, pursuant to the relevant policies and actions under Goal PS 4 of the general plan.

2.    Any development, including land disturbance, that is within fifty feet of any stream shall require a use permit to ensure that the development adequately avoids impacts to wetland features or woodlands, reduces impacts to the creek, and prevents degradation of riparian and wetland features from potential urban pollutants, pursuant to the relevant policies and actions related to creeks under Goal ER 1 of the general plan.

C.    Design Review. Certain uses also require design review. A list of those uses is contained in Section 17.18.090, Minor design review, and Section 17.20.030, Major design review.

D.    Principal Uses Only. Only principal uses are listed in Table 17.36-A. Accessory uses are addressed in Section 17.36.050, Accessory uses.

E.    Other Regulations. Some uses are also subject to the provisions of Title 5 and other titles of the San Pablo Municipal Code. Those provisions are in addition to the provisions in this chapter.

F.    Special Provisions. Special provisions related to a use are referenced in the special provisions column of Table 17.36-A.

17.38.080    Specific plan districts (SP#).

17.38.010 Purpose.
A.    Overlay Districts. The overlay districts are created to supplement the development standards of underlying districts to protect unique site features or implement location-specific regulations. The city has five overlay zoning districts as follows:

1.    Hillside area overlay district (D1).

2.    Priority development area (PDA) overlay district (D2).

3.    Air quality health risk overlay district (D3).

4.    Multifamily overlay district (MF).

5.    Creek protection overlay district (CP).

B.    Special Districts. The special districts are created to identify adopted area plans, including but not limited to specific plans. The city has adopted two specific plans as follows:

1.    23rd Street Specific Plan (SP1).

2.    San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan (SP2). (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.38.020 Effect of overlay and special districts.
A.    Overlay Districts. The overlay districts supplement the provisions of the underlying districts. Where the provisions of the overlay district conflict with the provisions of the underlying zoning district, the provisions of the overlay district shall prevail.

B.    Special Districts. The specific plan district serves to replaces the zoning provisions for the property within the district boundaries. As such, land use designations, allowed uses and development standards within the specific plan shall be consistent with the adopted provisions in the specific plan. Where the specific plan document refers to citywide procedures or standards, the citywide procedures or standards shall apply. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.38.030 Hillside area overlay district (D1).
The following provisions apply to the hillside area district (D1):

A.    Modifications to Underlying Districts.

1.    All structures that are more than one story in height shall require zoning administrator review in order to protect public safety in this generally unstable geologic area.

2.    Other than as provided in subsection (A)(1) of this section, the uses and development standards of the underlying districts shall apply.

B.    Findings. The following findings shall be made prior to granting approval or any other discretionary approval:

1.    A geotechnical report will be prepared to identity any particular geotechnical requirements or construction practices to protect the general public.

2.    The project is consistent with general plan and zoning standards.

3.    Design shall minimize grading, protect native trees, prevent significant alteration of natural hillside, and ensure revegetation.

4.    Fire protection shall be required and integrated in terms of water supply, fire access, and spacing around structures, and landscape. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.38.040 Priority development area (PDA) overlay district (D2).
A.    Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of the PDA overlay district is to promote and provide for higher density and pedestrian oriented uses as part of, or in proximity to, transit stations in line with Plan Bay Area’s Sustainable Community Strategy. These areas are suitable for redevelopment to increase employment and housing at appropriate locations due to planned transit, pedestrian and bicycle design, and parking reduction and management strategies. All components required in regional PDA designations apply.

B.    Applicability. Priority Development Area (PDA) districts have been designated and adopted by city resolutions (2011-131, 2011-132, 2014-133), and are identified as Rumrill Road, 23rd Street Specific Plan and San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan.

1.    Priority Development Area (PDA) Designation. The PDA overlay zoning district (D2) shall be applied to properties that are located within one-quarter mile of an existing or planned light rail/streetcar station or bus rapid transit station. In determining the extent of the applicability, a circle of one-quarter mile in radius shall be drawn from a central point at the designated station location (e.g., station platform).

C.    Development Standards. The following development standards (see Table 17.38-A) are applicable to the PDA overlay district. These standards, along with other development standards (e.g., landscaping requirements, parking standards) in this title and citywide design guidelines, are intended to assist property owners and project designers in understanding the city’s minimum requirements and expectations for high-quality development. Where site development standards listed herein are in conflict with the site development standards in other chapters of this code or the underlying base zoning district, these standards shall apply. The designated approving authority will review development applications against these standards to determine compliance with applicable zoning regulations.

17.38.060 Multifamily overlay district (MF).
A.    Purpose. The purpose of the multifamily overlay district is to recognize and protect existing multifamily development located on parcel(s) with an underlying zoning district that no longer allows multifamily development. Parcel(s) with this overlay designation are recognized as multifamily in the city’s general plan land use and housing elements and contribute to the city’s ability to meet regional housing needs.

B.    Designation. Multifamily overlay districts shall be delineated on the zoning map with the symbol (MF) in conjunction with the underlying base zoning district.

C.    Allowed Uses. Allowed uses applicable to this overlay district include multifamily use, in addition to the allowed uses of the underlying zoning district.

D.    Development Standards. Existing multifamily development may be renovated or improved consistent with existing building envelopes. Any request to expand or rebuild an existing multifamily development in this overlay district shall be consistent with the development standards for the city’s higher density residential zoning districts (R-3 and R-4), dependent upon corresponding density range. Maintenance, renovations, improvements and expansion shall be consistent with Chapter 17.08, Nonconformities. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.38.070 Creek protection overlay district (CP).
A.    Purpose. Creeks play an important role in groundwater recharge, surface water distribution, and flood management. As such, creeks are an important value to be protected.

B.    Designation. Creek protection overlay districts shall be delineated on the zoning map with the symbol (CP) in conjunction with the underlying base zoning district

C.    Standards. The following standards apply:

1.    No structure shall be placed in any floodway.

2.    Any structure in a floodplain shall have its finished floor at or above the one-hundred-foot floodline.

D.    Recommended Setbacks. Additional recommended setbacks are in the general plan storm water policies and related exhibit. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.38.080 Specific plan districts (SP#).
A.    Purpose. The purpose of the specific plan zoning district is to designate unique planning areas within the city for which the city council has adopted or requires adoption of a separate planning document (a specific plan) consistent with the general plan and state law. The contents, requirements, and adoption and amendment procedures for specific plans are listed in Section 17.22.030, Specific plan.

B.    Designation. Specific plan zoning districts shall be delineated on the zoning map in a manner similar to that of any other zoning district except that each specific plan-zoned area shall also bear a name, number, symbol, or other delineation, as determined by the zoning administrator, which distinguishes it from other specific plan zoning districts, base zoning districts, or overlay zoning districts. The assignment of the specific plan zoning district serves to provide a reference to the corresponding specific plan zoning document adopted by ordinance of the city council. Adopted specific plans are as follows:

1.    23rd Street Specific Plan (SP1).

2.    San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan (SP2)

C.    Allowed Uses. Allowed uses within the specific plan area are those listed uses in the adopted specific plan document as permitted, conditionally permitted, or not permitted.

D.    Development Standards. Development standards within the specific plan area are those standards listed in the adopted specific plan. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.42.040    Accessory structure development standards.

17.42.010 Purpose.
This chapter establishes development standards for accessory structures. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by maintaining safe distances between structures, establishing architectural compatibility between primary structures and certain types of accessory structures, and minimizing potential impacts associated with lot coverage, privacy, and maintenance of light and air space. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.42.020 Applicability.
The requirements contained in this chapter shall apply as follows:

A.    Accessory Structures on Private Property. Additional provisions and development standards contained elsewhere within the zoning code also apply.

B.    In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other provisions of this title, the stricter regulation shall control.

C.    This chapter regulates detached accessory structures only. Accessory structures that are attached (carports, garages, patio covers, porches) are considered part of the primary structure, and related provisions apply.

D.    For the purposes of this chapter, accessory dwelling units are not considered accessory structures and are separately defined and regulated pursuant to Section 17.60.070, Accessory dwelling units, and this chapter. (Ord. 2017-002 § 4, 2017; Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.42.030 Permit requirements and exemptions.
Structures larger than one hundred twenty square feet require a building permit. Plan check and zoning clearance is always required. Certain structures may require design review (minor or major), or other permits or entitlements as specified in Division II, Land Use Entitlements and Procedures. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.42.040 Accessory structure development standards.
A.    Development Standards for All Accessory Structures. Accessory structures containing full indoor cooking facilities (combination of a sink, cooking apparatus, and refrigeration appliance) and a full bath are accessory dwelling units and additionally follow Section 17.60.070. Pool houses that conform to the requirements of this chapter are permitted.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide regulation for height and lot measurements for building height and yard size. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.46.020 Height measurements.
The following rules apply to the calculation and determination of height of structures in the city. The intent of these regulations is to provide for compatibility in the measure of building height under a variety of circumstances (e.g., sloped site).

A.    Height Measurement. The height of a structure shall be measured as the vertical distance from the finish grade to the highest point of the roof of the structure. The measure excludes architectural features and appurtenances such as, but not limited to, chimneys, antennas, elevators, and similar mechanical equipment.

Figure 17.46-A Height Measurement

B.    Height Limits. Height limits are established throughout this title. Primarily, height limits are listed in Division III, Zoning Districts, Allowed Uses, and Development Standards, where they are listed by zoning district. Additional height limits are established for accessory structures (Chapter 17.42) and fences and walls (Chapter 17.45). Height limits are measured as the vertical distance from the finish grade of the site to an imaginary plane located the allowed number of feet above and parallel to the finish grade.

Figure 17.46-B Height Limit Measurement

(Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.46.030 Height exemptions.
A.    Architectural Features. In nonresidential districts, chimneys, cupolas, flagpoles, monuments, radio and other towers, gas storage holders, water tanks, and similar structures and mechanical appurtenances may be permitted in excess of building height limits by no more than fifteen feet in industrial districts and no more than ten feet in all other nonresidential zones, provided a use permit is obtained in each case. Towers or other volumes shall not extend for more than twenty feet in any horizontal direction.

B.    Rooftop Structures. Rooftop structures such as elevator and mechanical equipment enclosures or roof deck trellises and gazebos may exceed the height limit by ten feet, provided they are set back a minimum of ten feet from building walls and are screened on all sides by a parapet or sloping roof that is architecturally integrated within the building design.

(Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.46.040 Yard requirements.
The requirements set forth in this section shall be used in interpreting the yard and setback provisions.

A.    Front Yard Requirements. Front yards shall be required as follows:

1.    In the case of through parcels, front yards shall be provided on two frontages. Where one of the front yards required on a through parcel is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the average front yard setbacks of the yards provided on adjacent parcels may be substituted for the front yard required.

2.    In the case of corner parcels that do not have reversed frontage, a front yard of required depth shall be provided in accordance with the prevailing yard pattern.

3.    In the case of reversed frontage corner parcels, a front yard of the required depth shall be provided on one of the two frontages.

4.    In the case of corner parcels with more than two frontages, the planning department shall determine the front yard requirements; provided, that at least one front yard shall be provided having the full depth required generally in the district.

B.    Side Yard Requirements. Side yards shall be required as follows:

1.    In the case of through parcels, side yards shall extend from the rear lines of front yards required.

2.    In the case of a corner parcel which does not have reversed frontage, but is adjacent to a parcel with reversed frontage, the rear twenty feet of the side yard fronting the street shall not be less than the front yard required or existing on the adjacent parcel with reversed frontage.

3.    In the case of a corner parcel having reversed frontage, the rear twenty feet of the side yard fronting the street shall not be less than the front yard required or existing on the parcel adjacent to the side yard frontage. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.46.050 Yard measurements.
The methods of measurements set forth in this section shall be used in interpreting the yard and setback provisions.

A.    Front Yard Measurements. The depth of front yards shall be measured at right angles to a straight line joining the foremost points of the side property lines. In the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, the foremost point of side property lines shall be assumed to be the point at which the side and front lines would have met without such rounding. Front and rear front yard lines shall be parallel.

B.    Side Yard Measurements. The width of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the side property line.

C.    Rear Yard Measurements. The depth of a required rear yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is a strip of the minimum depth required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the rear property line.

D.    Special Yards. In those situations where a special yard exists, the zoning administrator shall require a yard with minimum dimensions as generally required for a side yard or a rear yard in the district, determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of the parcel on which the yard is to be located to the adjoining parcel or parcels, with due regard to the orientation and location of structures and buildable areas thereon.

Figure 17.46-D Yard Area Measurement

(Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.46.060 Yard encroachments.
Yard encroachments shall be allowed as provided in this section.

A.    Architectural Features—Cornices and Eaves. Architectural features such as cornices, eaves, and canopies may not extend more than three feet into any required yard or public right-of-way, provided such elements have a clearance of eight feet above the ground. An encroachment permit from the public works department is required for encroachments into the public right-of-way.

B.    Architectural Features—Balconies, Chimneys, and Bay Windows. Replacement chimneys, bay windows, balconies, media centers, fire escapes, exterior stairs, and similar architectural features may encroach a maximum distance of two feet into required side yards or three feet into any required rear yard, provided such features shall be at least three feet from a property line. These standards also apply to landings greater than thirty-six inches above grade. Landings that do not exceed thirty-six inches above grade are addressed in subsection C of this section.

C.    Porches and Decks. Decks, platforms, uncovered porches, and landing places that do not exceed a height of thirty-six inches above grade may encroach into any front or corner side yard a maximum distance of six feet and project into any rear or interior side yard up to five feet from the property line.

D.    Official Plan Lines. Whenever an official plan line, such as a planned future right-of-way line, has been established for any street, required yards shall be measured from such line and in no case shall the provisions of this chapter be construed as permitting any encroachment upon any official plan lines.

E.    Corner Parcels. At corner parcels, setback/built-to requirements apply to both street frontages. Corner lot vision triangle standards apply; see Section 17.46.070, Corner lot vision triangle.

(Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.46.070 Corner lot vision triangle.
Vision triangles apply only to corner lots. The boundaries of a vision triangle are formed by drawing lines from the point of intersection of a lot’s street corner property lines to points thirty feet along the two property lines and then connecting the two points with a straight line.

A.    Residential Districts. No wall, fence, gate, or hedge higher than three feet shall be erected or maintained on a corner lot in any residential district within the area called the vision triangle.

B.    Other Districts. In any district other than a residential district, no wall, fence, gate, hedge, or other obstruction to view shall be erected or maintained between three feet and eight feet above grade on any corner lot within the area called the vision triangle.

C.    Planting and Landscape Materials. Planting and landscape materials (except for street trees) shall not exceed three feet in height within the vision triangle area.

17.54.040 General rules.
A.    Mixed Uses. When two or more uses are located on the same lot or parcel or within the same building, the number of off-street parking spaces required shall be the sum of the total of the requirements of the various individual uses computed separately, except as otherwise provided in Section 17.54.050, Parking waiver.

B.    Cooperative Facilities. Required off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be provided through the cooperative establishment and operation of a common parking facility, subject to the following provisions:

1.    The total number of spaces so provided shall not be less than the sum of the individual requirements, except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section.

2.    The facility shall conform to all other sections of these standards.

3.    An attached copy of a contract between the parties and their heirs, successors, lessees, or designees concerned, setting forth the agreement regarding such joint use, shall be filed with the application.

C.    Shared Parking. In cases where operators of uses wish to cooperatively establish and operate parking facilities, and certain uses generate parking demands primarily during hours when the remaining uses are not in operation or have a low demand, a reduction in the total number of spaces may be granted, subject to the following provisions:

1.    A request for shared parking shall be accompanied by a parking study prepared by a qualified parking or transportation expert.

2.    An attached copy of a contract between the parties and their heirs, successors, lessees, or designees concerned, setting forth the agreement regarding such joint use, shall be filed with the application and recorded with the county recorder’s office.

D.    Rules of Calculation. The following rules pertain to calculating the parking space requirements set forth in this chapter:

1.    When a number of spaces per employee is stipulated, that number shall be based on the maximum number of employees working on the premises at any given time during a normal work schedule.

2.    Unless otherwise specified, when a number of spaces per square feet is stipulated, that measurement shall be of the gross floor area of each building devoted to such use, less the interior space used for parking, loading, heating and air-conditioning equipment, stairs and elevators, mechanical and electrical equipment, and communications equipment.

3.    When the parking space requirement results in a fraction of a space, the next higher whole number of spaces shall be provided.

E.    Prohibited Parking. The parking of any ambulance, tow truck, vehicle for hire, or commercial vehicle having a manufacturer’s gross vehicle weight rating of ten thousand pounds or more on any lot or street in any residential district shall be considered a commercial use and is prohibited except for deliveries and pickups as provided in Title 10, Vehicles and Traffic.

B.    On-Street Parking. On-street parking adjacent to the subject property may be counted toward the parking requirement.

C.    Elderly Housing. For multiple-family dwellings designed and used for elderly housing, the number of parking spaces may be reduced based upon factors such as: ongoing bus-resident services, and expectation of resident driving.

D.    Credit for Clean Air Vehicle. As an incentive for electric vehicles and other clean air vehicles, one vehicle defined as a clean air vehicle according to Section 17.54.110, Clean air vehicle parking, may count as fifty vehicles toward the minimum parking requirements.

E.    Credit for Nonexclusive Use by General Public. Parking lots or garages that are available for nonexclusive public use are eligible for a ten percent reduction in minimum parking requirements.

F.    Proximity to Transit. Buildings located within one-quarter mile of a transit stop, the number of parking spaces may be reduced by ten percent.

G.    If a bicycle rack is provided, one parking space may be waived.

H.    Parking in Mixed-Use Projects. In mixed-use projects with residential, office, and/or commercial components, it is assumed that some parking spaces will be shared due to the difference in peak parking demand.

1.    Calculation of the minimum vehicular parking for the portion of the building occupied by the primary use is based on one hundred percent of the floor area.

2.    Calculation of the minimum vehicular parking for the portion of the building occupied by secondary or subsequent uses may be calculated at eighty percent of the floor area.

I.    Additional Parking Reductions. The city may consider additional reductions to parking standards in subject to the issuance of a use permit, as follows:

1.    The application shall be accompanied by a parking study prepared by a qualified parking or transportation expert.

17.56.020    Applicability.

17.56.030    General lighting requirements.

17.56.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate parking lot lighting to balance the safety and security needs for lighting with the city’s desire to preserve dark skies and to ensure that light trespass and glare have negligible impact on surrounding property (especially residential) and roadways. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.56.020 Applicability.
The requirements of this chapter apply to all new development. Whenever a person is required to obtain a building permit, electrical permit, and/or approval of a planning entitlement, the applicant shall submit sufficient information for the approving authority to determine whether the proposed lighting will comply with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.56.030 General lighting requirements.
A.    The requirements listed below shall apply to new parking lot lighting.

B.    Nuisance Prevention. All outdoor lighting shall be designed, located, installed, directed downward or toward structures, fully shielded, and maintained in order to prevent glare, light trespass, and light pollution.

C.    Maintenance. Fixtures and lighting shall be maintained in good working order and in a manner that serves the original design intent.

1.    Burnt-out and broken light bulbs shall be replaced.

2.    Lighting fixtures shall remain free of graffiti and rust.

3.    Painted light fixtures shall be maintained to minimize chipping or peeling.

D.    Shielding. Except as otherwise exempt, all outdoor lighting shall be recessed and/or constructed with full downward shielding in order to reduce light and glare impacts on trespass to adjoining properties and public rights-of-way. Each fixture shall be directed downward and away from adjoining properties and public rights-of-way, so that no light fixture directly illuminates an area outside of the project site intended to be illuminated. See Figure 17.56-A: Shielding and Maximum Height of Parking Lot Light Fixtures.

E.    Maximum Height. The maximum height of parking lot light fixtures abutting residential development shall be fifteen feet. Otherwise, the maximum height for parking lot light structures shall be twenty feet. Height limit for parking lot light fixtures in industrial areas is twenty-five feet. Height shall be measured from the finish grade, inclusive of the pedestal, to the top of the fixture. See Figure 17.56-A: Shielding and Maximum Height of Parking Lot Light Fixtures.

Figure 17.56-A: Shielding and Maximum Height of Parking Lot Light Fixtures

F.    Level of Illumination. Outdoor lighting shall be designed to illuminate at the minimum level necessary for safety and security and to avoid the harsh contrasts in lighting levels between the project site and adjacent properties. Illumination requirements are provided in Table 17.56-A—Illumination Requirements.

(Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.60.020 Density bonus and other incentives.
A.    Purpose. This section is intended to provide incentives for the production of child care and housing facilities for very low-, low-, and moderate-income and senior households. In enacting this section, it is the intent of the city of San Pablo to facilitate the development of affordable housing and to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the city’s general plan and housing element. This section is enacted under the authority of Government Code Sections 65915 through 65917.

B.    Eligibility of Density Bonus.

1.    General. The city of San Pablo shall either grant a density bonus and concessions or incentives as set forth in subsection C of this section, Types of Density Bonus and Other Incentives Allowed.

2.    Density Bonus—Minimum Requirements (Target Units). The city shall grant a density bonus to an applicant for a residential project who seeks a density bonus and agrees to construct at least one of the following:

a.    Ten percent of the total units as target units affordable to low-income households.

b.    Five percent of the total units as target units affordable to very low-income households.

c.    A senior citizen housing development.

d.    Ten percent of the total units of a newly constructed condominium project or planned development as target units affordable to moderate-income households. (Government Code Section 65915(b).)

C.    Types of Density Bonus and Other Incentives Allowed.

1.    Density Bonus—Calculation of Bonus Units. In determining the number of density bonus units to be granted, the maximum residential density for the site shall be multiplied by 0.20, unless a lesser number is selected by the developer. When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next larger integer.

a.    For each one percent increase above ten percent in the percentage of units affordable to low-income households, the density bonus is increased by one and one-half percent up to a maximum of thirty-five percent.

b.    For each one percent increase above five percent in the percentage of units affordable to very low-income households, the density bonus is increased by two and one-half percent up to a maximum of thirty-five percent.

c.    For each one percent increase above ten percent of the percentage of units affordable to moderate-income households, the density bonus is increased by one percent up to a maximum of thirty-five percent.

d.    The density bonus units shall not be included when determining the number of target units required to qualify for a density bonus. When calculating the required number of target units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next larger integer. (Government Code Section 65915(g)(1).)

2.    The developer may request a lesser density bonus than the project is entitled to, but no reduction will be permitted in the number of required target units as stated above. Regardless of the number of target units, no residential project is entitled to a density bonus of more than thirty-five percent.

The maximum density bonus allowed including supplemental increases is thirty-five percent.

1.    An applicant shall only be eligible to receive the density bonus described in this subsection if all the conditions listed in Government Code Section 65915(h)(1) through (6) are met.

2.    Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the authority of the city to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development.

3.    A residential project shall be eligible for the density bonus described in this section if the city makes all of the following findings:

a.    The developer will donate and transfer the land no later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or development application for the residential project.

b.    The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low-income households in an amount not less than ten percent of the number of residential units of the proposed development, or will permit construction of a greater percentage of units if proposed by the developer.

c.    The transferred land is at least one acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of at least forty units, has the appropriate general plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development as very low-income housing, and is now or at the time of construction will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure.

2.    Of the children who attend the child care facility, the percentage of children of very low-income households, low-income households, or moderate-income households shall be equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are proposed to be affordable to very low-income households, low-income households, or moderate-income households.

3.    Notwithstanding any requirement of this subsection, the city is not required to provide a density bonus or incentive for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community already has adequate child care facilities (Government Code Section 65915(i)(2)).

I.    Additional Density Bonus and Incentives or Concessions for Condominium Conversions.

1.    The city shall grant either a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value if the applicant for a conversion of existing rental apartments to condominiums agrees to provide thirty-three percent of the total units of the proposed condominium project as target units affordable to low- or moderate-income households, or to provide fifteen percent of the total units in the condominium conversion project as target units affordable to low-income households. All such target units shall remain affordable for the period specified in subsection (N) of this section, Continued Availability.

2.    For purposes of this section, a “density bonus” means an increase in units of twenty-five percent over the number of apartments to be provided within the existing structure or structures proposed for conversion.

3.    No condominium conversion shall be eligible for a density bonus if the apartments proposed for conversion constitute a residential project for which a density bonus or other incentives were previously provided pursuant to this article or the applicable sections of state planning law.

J.    General Provisions Related to Density Bonuses and Incentives or Concessions.

1.    All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

2.    The density bonus units shall not be included when determining the number of target units required to qualify for a density bonus. When calculating the required number of target units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next larger integer. The density bonus shall apply to residential projects of five or more dwelling units.

3.    The developer may request a lesser density bonus than the project is entitled to, but no reduction will be permitted in the number of required target units. Regardless of the number of target units, no housing development maybe entitled to a density bonus of more than thirty-five percent.

4.    The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval.

K.    Affordability and Development Standards.

1.    Timing of Construction. Target units shall be constructed concurrently with nonrestricted units or pursuant to a schedule included in the density bonus housing agreement.

2.    Continued Affordability—Rent. Target units offered for rent for low-income and very low-income households shall be made available for rent at an affordable rent and shall remain restricted and affordable to the designated income group for a minimum period of thirty years. A longer period of time may be specified if required by any construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program applicable to the housing development.

3.    Continued Affordability—For Sale. Target units offered for sale to very low-, low-, or moderate-income households in condominiums and planned developments shall be sold at an affordable ownership cost. The maximum resale price shall be the lower of: (a) fair market value or (b) the seller’s initial purchase price, increased by the lesser of (i) the rate of increase of area median income during the seller’s ownership or (ii) the rate at which the consumer price index increased during the seller’s ownership. The seller of the unit shall retain the market value at the time of sale of any capital improvements made by the seller, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation. Because this subsection limits the seller’s appreciation, the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation is one hundred percent (Government Code Section 65915(c)).

4.    Initial Occupant of Moderate-Income Unit in Condominium Project or Planned Unit Development. The initial occupant of the moderate-income units that are directly related to the receipt of the density bonus units in a condominium project or a planned unit development must be persons or families of moderate income. (See definitions.) Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall recapture its proportionate share of appreciation, equal to the percentage by which the initial sale price to the moderate-income household was less than the fair market value of the home at the time of sale (Government Code Section 65915(c)(2)).

L.    Parking.

1.    Upon the request of the applicant, the city may not require a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, of a development meeting the criteria of this section that exceeds the following ratios:

Table 17.60-D—Parking

Bedrooms

Number of Parking Spaces

0—1

1

2—3

2

4 or more

2.5

2.    If the total number of parking spaces required for a development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this section, a development may provide “on-site parking” through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on-street parking (Government Code Section 65915(p)).

3.    The city shall not apply any development standard that would have the effect of precluding the construction of a residential project meeting the requirements of subsection B of this section, Eligibility of Density Bonus, incentives at the densities or with the incentives permitted by this chapter. An applicant may submit to the city a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be interpreted to require the city to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific adverse effect, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Government Code Section 65589.5, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which the city determines there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. Furthermore, the applicant shall be required to prove that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the target units economically feasible.

M.    Location of Bonus Units. The following provisions apply to the location of bonus units:

1.    As required by state law (California Government Code Section 65915(j)), the location of density bonus units within the residential project may be at the discretion of the developer. However, the inclusionary units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the development and shall contain on average the same number of bedrooms as the noninclusionary units in the development, and shall be compatible with the design or use of the remaining units in terms of appearance, materials, and quality finish.

2.    Target units shall be built on site, unless off-site construction is approved at the city’s discretion, and shall be dispersed within the residential project. The number of bedrooms of the target units shall be equivalent to the bedroom mix of the nontarget units of the housing development, except that the developer may include a higher proportion of target units with more bedrooms. The design and appearance of the target units shall be compatible with the design of the total residential project. Residential projects shall comply with all applicable development standards, except those which may be modified as provided by this chapter.

3.    Target units shall be constructed concurrently with nonrestricted units or pursuant to a schedule included in the density bonus housing agreement.

N.    Continued Availability. The following provisions apply to continued availability of affordable units:

1.    If a residential project providing low- or very low-income target units receives only a density bonus, the target must remain restricted to low- or very low-income households for a minimum of thirty years from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

2.    If a residential project providing low- or very low-income target units receives both a density bonus and an additional incentive, the target units must remain restricted to low- or very low-income households for a minimum of fifty years from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

3.    In the case of a residential project providing moderate-income target units, the initial occupant of the target unit must be a person of a family of moderate income. Upon resale, the seller of the target units shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation, which shall be used within three years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of Section 33334.2 of the California Health and Safety Code that promote homeownership. The city’s “proportionate share” shall be equal to the percentage by the initial sale price to the moderate-income household that was less than the fair market value of the home at the time of the initial sale.

O.    Application Requirements and Review. An application for a density bonus, incentive, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard under this section shall be submitted with the first application for approval of a residential project and processed concurrently with all other applications required for the residential project. The application shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the city and shall include at least the following information:

1.    Site plan showing total number of units, number and location of target units, and number and location of proposed density bonus units.

2.    Level of affordability of target units and proposals for ensuring affordability. (See subsection K of this section, Affordability and Development Standards.)

3.    Description of any requested incentives, waivers, modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards.

a.    For all incentives, the application shall include substantial evidence that the requested incentives result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions (Government Code Section 65915(l)(3)).

b.    For waivers or modifications of development standards, the application shall provide substantial evidence to show that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible and that the development standards will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of subsection B of this section, Eligibility of Density Bonus, at the densities or with the incentives permitted by this subsection (Government Code Section 65915(e) and (f)).

c.    The applicant shall submit a development pro forma in a form prescribed by the city or the city’s economic consultant. The applicant shall pay the cost of peer review of the development pro forma.

P.    Approval Body. An application for a density bonus, incentive, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard under this section shall be considered by and acted upon by the approval body with authority to approve the residential project. Any decision regarding a density bonus, incentive, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard may be appealed to the city council. Neither the granting of an incentive, waiver, or modification nor the granting of a density bonus shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, variance, or other discretionary approval (Government Code Section 65915(g)(1) and (2)).

Q.    Findings for Approval. Before approving an application for a density bonus, incentive, waiver, or modification, the approval body shall make the following findings:

1.    If the density bonus is based all or in part on donation of land, the findings included in subsection G of this section, Density Bonus for Donation of Land.

2.    If the density bonus, incentive, or concession is based all or in part on the inclusion of a child care facility, the findings included in subsection H of this section, Additional Density Bonus and Incentives or Concessions for Development of Child Care Facilities.

3.    If the incentive or concession includes mixed-use development, the finding included in subsection F of this section, Available Incentives and Concessions.

4.    If a waiver or modification is requested, the developer has shown by substantial evidence that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible (Government Code Section 65915(f)).

R.    Findings Required for Denial of Incentive. If a request for an incentive is otherwise consistent with this section, the approval body may deny an incentive if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following:

1.    The incentive is not required to provide for affordable rents or affordable ownership costs.

2.    The incentive would have a specific adverse impact upon: (a) public health or safety; (b) the physical environment; or (c) any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources; and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. For the purpose of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete (Government Code Sections 65589.5 and 65915(d)(1)).

S.    Findings Required for Denial of Waiver or Modification. If a request for a waiver or modification is otherwise consistent with this section, the approval body may deny the waiver or modification only if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following:

1.    The waiver or modification would have a specific adverse impact upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.

2.    The waiver or modification would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.

T.    Findings Required for Denial of Bonus or Incentive for Child Care Facility. If a density bonus or concession is based on the provision of child care facilities, the approval body may deny the bonus or concession if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that the city already has adequate child care facilities (Government Code Section 65915(i)(3)).

U.    Density Bonus Housing Agreement Required. An applicant requesting a density bonus shall agree to enter into a density bonus housing agreement with the city. The agreement shall be made a condition of each discretionary planning permit for the residential project under this subsection. (Government Code Section 65917.)

V.    Recordation. The density bonus housing agreement shall be recorded as a restriction on any parcel on which the target units or density bonus units will be constructed. It shall be recorded before or concurrently with final or parcel map approval, or, where the housing development does not include a map, before issuance of a building permit for any structure in the housing development. The density bonus housing agreement shall run with the land and bind all successors in interest.

W.    Contents. The density bonus housing agreement shall include but not be limited to the following:

1.    The total number of units approved for the housing development, the number, location, and level of affordability of target units, and the number of density bonus units.

17.60.070 Accessory dwelling units.
A.    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow for accessory dwelling units to be established by right according to state law through administrative approval. Facilitating the development of accessory dwelling units will increase the housing options for family members, seniors, low-wage workers, persons with disabilities, students and others in the community. An accessory dwelling unit that conforms to all applicable requirements shall not be considered in the calculation of allowable density for the lot upon which it is located, and is deemed to be a residential use that is consistent with the existing general plan and zoning designations for the lot.

B.    Requirements Applicable to All Accessory Dwelling Units.

17.62.010 Adult-oriented businesses.
A.    Purpose. It is the intent of this section to prevent community-wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult-oriented businesses in close proximity to each other or in proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, religious institutions, and residentially zoned districts. The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult-oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this section to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult-oriented businesses in certain areas. Operating regulations for adult-oriented businesses are set forth in Chapter 9.28.

B.    Minimum Proximity Requirements. No adult-oriented business shall be established or located within certain distances of certain specified land uses or zones as set forth below.

1.    No such business shall be established or located within one thousand feet of any other adult-oriented business.

2.    No such business shall be established or located in any residential zone in the city or within two hundred fifty feet from any residential zone located in the city of San Pablo.

3.    No such business shall be established or located within seven hundred fifty feet from any existing religious institution, park, or school on property located in the city of San Pablo.

4.    The distances set forth above shall be measured as a radius from the primary entrance of the building in which the adult-oriented business is located, or is to be located, to the property lines of the property so zoned or used without regard to intervening structures.

C.    Nonconforming Adult-Oriented Business Uses. Existing nonconforming adult-oriented business uses shall not be subject to this chapter, except as provided below.

1.    Abandonment. Notwithstanding the above, any discontinuance or abandonment of the use of any lot or structure as an adult-oriented business for a consecutive six-month period shall result in a loss of legal nonconforming status of such use.

2.    Any adult-oriented business operating as a conforming use with an approved adult-oriented business regulatory permit from the city shall not be rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent location of a religious institution or school within the locational limitations of this chapter.

3.    All persons who possess an outstanding business permit or license heretofore issued for the operation of an adult-oriented business and all persons required by this section to obtain an adult-oriented business performer permit must apply for and obtain such a permit within ninety days of the effective date of this chapter. Failure to do so and continued operation of an adult-oriented business, or the continued performances depicting specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities in an adult-oriented business, after such time without a permit shall constitute a violation of this section.

D.    Exclusions. This section does not apply to any of the following activities:

1.    Any activity of a person licensed to practice one or more of the healing arts pursuant to Division 2 of the California Business and Professions Code, if and to the extent that such activity is authorized by such license.

2.    Any activity conducted or sponsored by any school district or other public agency; so long as such activity is being conducted as part of and within the scope of an authorized and regular part of the curriculum or is part of a training or instructional program being conducted by a public agency.

17.62.160 Restaurants, fast service.
A.    Purpose. Provisions within this chapter have a dual purpose. Standards for fast-food drive-in and drive-through windows and remote tellers are provided to address the mitigation of traffic, congestion, excessive pavement, pedestrian connections, litter, and noise and the adjacency to surrounding incompatible uses. Provisions to encourage the provision of healthy food options within San Pablo neighborhoods are also included.

B.    Applicability. Development standards herein shall apply to all new permits for facilities defined as restaurants, fast service and will be reviewed in conjunction with any required conditional use permit and/or development review application.

C.    Development and Design Standards. The following standards shall be the minimum requirements for all drive-in and drive-through facilities. Deviations to these provisions may be considered through the issuance of a site plan and architectural review permit.

1.    Location. Uses with drive-through facilities shall be three hundred feet away from any intersection and from another drive-through facility on the same side of the street, except within a shopping center or master plan.

2.    Separation from Residential Areas. Fast-food restaurant facilities shall be a minimum of one thousand feet away from residential district boundaries. This distance may be decreased with a use permit as specified in subsection D of this section, Healthy Food Options.

3.    Separation from Schools. Fast-food restaurant facilities shall be a minimum of one thousand feet away from any school. This distance may be decreased with a use permit as specified below under subsection D of this section, Healthy Food Options.

4.    Site Area. Uses with drive-through facilities shall have a minimum one acre net land area. This minimum land area may be modified when the drive-through facility is within a master plan or an integrated shopping center through the design review process.

5.    Floor Area. The minimum floor area for drive-through facilities shall be one thousand square feet. The minimum floor area for a drive-through facility other than a fast-food restaurant may be modified through the design review process.

6.    Site Coverage. The maximum lot coverage shall be forty percent of the net lot area. The minimum on-site landscaping, which includes articulated plazas, courtyards, and patios, shall be fifteen percent of the net lot area exclusive of public right-of-way.

7.    Parking and Aisles. Parking and the drive-through lane shall be set back forty-five feet from the ultimate curb face. Greater setbacks may be required as mentioned in an applicable specific plan or as deemed necessary during the design review process.

8.    Site Planning/Building Orientation. Future drive-through facilities in a master plan or shopping center shall be identified early in the review process to avoid retrofitting the uses at a later date. The site design shall minimize pedestrian/vehicle conflicts and avoid locating driveways and service areas which interfere with the flow of on-site circulation. Building placement shall be done in a manner to create new pedestrian spaces and plaza areas. Buildings shall orient the public entrances toward the street. Building layout shall be oriented to screen the drive-through lane. Drive-through lanes shall be screened through building orientation and the use of a combination of low-screen walls, heavy landscaping, and trelliswork.

9.    Stacking Distance/Parking. The drive-through lane shall be of a sufficient length to accommodate the necessary stacking of cars. The stacking distance shall be determined through a parking study as provided in Chapter 17.54, Parking and Loading. Each drive-through lane shall be separate from the circulation route necessary for ingress and egress from the property or access to any parking spaces within the site. These requirements do not apply to the reuse of existing properties.

10     Parking. The parking requirements for drive-through facilities shall be determined according to Chapter 17.54, Parking and Loading. The gross floor area for outdoor seating shall be subject to the same parking requirement.

11.    Pedestrian Orientation. The site plan shall create opportunities for courtyards and plazas and other landscape open space to promote safe and convenient pedestrian movement with continuous landscape pathways between buildings. The design shall discourage a need for pedestrians to have to cross a drive-through lane wherever possible.

12.    Architecture. Drive-through facilities within an integrated shopping center or master plan must have an architectural style consistent with the theme established in the center. Architecture must provide compatibility with surrounding uses in form, materials, colors, scale, etc. Building planes shall have variation in depth and angle to create variety and interest in the basic form and silhouette of the building. Articulation of building surface shall be encouraged through the use of openings and recesses which create texture and shadow patterns. Building entrances shall be well articulated and project a formal entrance through variation of architectural plane, pavement surface, treatment, and landscape plaza.

13.    Signs. Drive-through facilities in an integrated shopping center or master plan must comply with the uniform sign program as established in the center.

14.    Performance Standards. Special performance standards for fast-food restaurants with drive-through facilities: The use shall be operated in a manner that does not interfere with the normal use of adjoining properties. If in the opinion of the zoning administrator the provisions of this subsection are being violated, the violations shall be grounds for reopening conditional use permit hearings and adding conditions to control the violation. Performance standards include, but are not limited to, the following considerations, which, where appropriate, shall be incorporated as conditions of approval in all use permits as determined by the planning commission or city council:

a.    Noise levels measured at the property line shall not exceed the level of background noise normally found in the area.

b.    The premises shall be kept clean, and the operator shall make all reasonable efforts to see that no trash or litter originating from the use is deposited on adjacent properties. For drive-through restaurants or other uses which typically generate trash or litter, adequate trash containers, as determined by the zoning administrator, shall be required and employees shall be required daily to pick up trash or litter originating from the site and within three hundred feet of the perimeter of the property.

c.    All graffiti shall be removed within seventy-two hours.

d.    No undesirable odors shall be generated on the site.

e.    The on-site manager of the use shall take whatever steps are deemed necessary to assure the orderly conduct of employees, patrons, and visitors on the premises.

f.    A copy of these performance standards and all conditional use permit conditions of approval shall be posted alongside the necessary business licenses and be visible at all times to employees.

D.    Healthy Food Options. A use permit may be issued to eliminate the one-thousand-foot separation requirement between fast-service restaurants, schools, and residential districts if it can be demonstrated by the applicant that healthy food options will be available. A minimum of twenty percent of the menu options shall consist of healthy food choices as defined in Division VI, Glossary. (Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.62.200 Wireless facilities—For facilities covered under Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a)).
A.    Legislative Intent.

1.    Background. Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112-96, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), generally requires that state and local governments “may not deny, and shall approve” requests to collocate, remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station. Federal Communications Commission regulations interpret this statute and create procedural rules for local review, which generally preempt certain subjective land-use regulations, limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential “deemed granted” remedy when the state or local government fails to approve or deny the request within sixty days after submittal (accounting for any tolling periods). Moreover, whereas Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 332, applies to only “personal wireless service facilities” (e.g., cellular telephone towers and equipment), Section 6409(a) applies to all “wireless” facilities licensed or authorized by the FCC (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, satellite, microwave backhaul, etc.).

2.    Legislative Findings. The city council finds that the overlap between wireless deployments covered under Section 6409(a) and other wireless deployments, combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments, creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values. The city council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with Section 6409(a) contained in a section devoted to Section 6409(a) will mitigate such potential confusion, streamline local review and preserve the city’s land-use authority to maximum extent possible.

3.    Intent. The city of San Pablo intends this section to establish reasonable and uniform standards and procedures in a manner that protects and promotes the public health, safety and welfare, consistent with and subject to federal and California State law, for wireless facilities collocations and modifications pursuant to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112-96, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), and related FCC regulations codified in 47 CFR 1.40001 et seq. This section is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or applied to: (a) prohibit or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service provider’s ability to provide personal wireless services; (b) prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity’s ability to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service, subject to any competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory rules or regulation for rights-of-way management; (c) unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; (d) deny any request for authorization to place, construct or modify personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the FCC’s regulations concerning such emissions; (e) prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny under federal or California State law; or (f) otherwise authorize the city to preempt any applicable federal or California State law.

B.    Definitions. The abbreviations, phrases, terms and words in this section will have the meanings assigned to them in this section or, as may be appropriate, in Section 17.68.020 (Universal definitions), as may be amended from time to time, unless context indicates otherwise. Undefined phrases, terms or words in this section will have the meanings assigned to them in 47 U.S.C. Section 702, as may be amended from time to time, and, if not defined therein, will have their ordinary meanings. In the event that any definition assigned to any phrase, term or word in this section conflicts with any federal or state-mandated definition, the federal or state-mandated definition will control.

1.    “Approving authority” means the commission, board or official responsible for review of permit applications and vested with the authority to approve or deny such applications. The approving authority for a project which requires a Section 6409(a) approval refers to the zoning administrator.

2.    “Base station” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as a structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a tower.

a.    The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

b.    The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks).

c.    The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under this section, supports or houses equipment described in subsections (B)(2)(a) and (b) of this section, codified as 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(1)(i) and (ii), that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support.

d.    The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under this section, does not support or house equipment described in subsections (B)(2)(a) and (b) of this section, codified as 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(1)(i) and (ii).

Note: As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC’s definition refers to any structure that actually supports wireless equipment even though it was not originally intended for that purpose. Examples include, but are not limited to, wireless facilities mounted on buildings, utility poles and transmission towers, light standards or traffic signals. A structure without wireless equipment replaced with a new structure designed to bear the additional weight from wireless equipment constitutes a base station.

3.    “City manager” means the city manager of the city of San Pablo or his or her designee.

4.    “Collocation” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended, which defines that term as the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes. As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC’s definition effectively means “to add” and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility installed at a single site.

5.    “Eligible facilities request” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: (a) collocation of new transmission equipment; (b) removal of transmission equipment; or (c) replacement of transmission equipment.

6.    “Eligible support structure” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which defines that term as any tower or base station as defined in this section; provided, that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under this section.

7.    “Existing” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of the FCC’s Section 6409(a) regulations if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process; provided, that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.

8.    “FCC” means the Federal Communications Commission or its duly appointed successor agency.

9.    “Personal wireless services” means the same as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(C)(i), as may be amended, which defines the term as commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services and common carrier wireless exchange access services.

10.    “Personal wireless service facilities” means the same as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(C)(i), as may be amended, which defines the term as facilities that provide personal wireless services.

11.    “RF” means radio frequency or electromagnetic waves between thirty kHz and three hundred GHz in the electromagnetic spectrum range.

12.    “Section 6409(a)” means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), as may be amended.

13.    “Site” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(6), as may be amended, which provides that for towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

14.    “Substantial change” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular facility type (tower or base station) and location (in or outside the public right-of-way). For clarity, this definition organizes the FCC’s criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the facility type and location.

a.    For towers outside the public rights-of-way, a substantial change occurs when:

i.    The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty feet (whichever is greater); or

ii.    The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than twenty feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or

iii.    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or

iv.    The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.

b.    For towers in the public rights-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when:

i.    The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet (whichever is greater); or

ii.    The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station; or

iii.    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or

iv.    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or

v.    The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

c.    In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when:

i.    The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the director; or

ii.    The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval; provided, however, that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.

Note: The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012—the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a).

15.    “Tower” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended, which defines that term as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site. Examples include, but are not limited to, mono-trees and lattice towers.

16.    “Transmission equipment” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that term as equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

17.    “Wireless” means any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service transmitted over frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.

18.    “Wireless facility” means any installation or facilities used to provide personal wireless services. The term includes, without limitation, freestanding facilities (such as monopoles), building-mounted facilities and facilities mounted on utility infrastructure, which includes without limitation facilities mounted on cables or wires between utility poles. The term does not include facilities solely intended for indoor use, such as a Wi-Fi router in a home or business.

C.    Applicability. This section applies to all collocations or modifications to an existing wireless tower or base station submitted with a written request for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a). However, the applicant may voluntarily elect to seek either an administrative use permit or conditional use permit, as may be appropriate, under Section 17.62.300.

D.    Approval Required.

1.    Section 6409(a) Approval. Any request to collocate, replace or remove transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station submitted with a written request for approval under Section 6409(a) shall require a “Section 6409(a) approval” subject to the zoning administrator’s approval, conditional approval or denial pursuant to the standards and procedures contained in subsection F of this section (Decisions).

2.    Other Regulatory Approvals Required. No collocation or modification approved under any Section 6409(a) approval may occur unless the applicant also obtains all other permits or regulatory approvals from other city departments and state or federal agencies. Furthermore, any Section 6409(a) approval granted under this section shall remain subject to any and all lawful conditions and/or requirements associated with such other permits or regulatory approvals from other city departments and state or federal agencies.

E.    Permit Applications.

1.    Application Requirement. The city shall not approve any wireless facility subject to this section except upon a duly filed application consistent with the provisions in this subsection E and any other written rules the city or the city manager may establish from time to time in any publicly stated format.

2.    Application Content. The city council authorizes the city manager to develop and publish permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials that the city manager finds necessary, appropriate or useful for processing requests for Section 6409(a) approvals. Without further authorization from the city council, the city manager may from time to time update and alter any such permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials as the city manager deems necessary, appropriate or useful to respond to regulatory, technological or other changes. The materials required under this section are minimum requirements for any application.

a.    Planning Application Form and Applicable Fee. The applicant must complete, execute and submit the planning application form and tender to the city the applicable fee in the amount established by city council resolution pursuant to Chapter 17.06 (Fees). In the event the city does not require a specific fee for Section 6409(a) approvals, the highest fee applicable to an administrative use permit will be required.

b.    Title Report and Owner’s Authorization. The applicant must provide a title report prepared within the six months prior to the application filing date in order for the city to verify the property owner’s identity. If the applicant does not own the subject property, the application must include a written authorization signed by the property owner that empowers the applicant to file the application and perform all facility construction, installation, operation and maintenance to the extent described in the application.

c.    CPCN. To the extent that the applicant claims any regulatory authorization or other right to use the public rights-of-way, such as a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the applicant must provide a true and correct copy of the certificate, license, notice to proceed or other regulatory authorization that supports the applicant’s claim.

d.    Prior Regulatory Approvals. Evidence that the applicant holds all current licenses and registrations from the FCC and any other applicable regulatory bodies where such license(s) or registration(s) are necessary to provide wireless services utilizing the proposed wireless facility. For any prior local regulatory approval(s) associated with the wireless facility, the applicant must submit copies of all such approvals, including any corresponding approved project plans and conditions of approval. Alternatively, the applicant may submit a written justification that sets forth reasons why prior regulatory approvals were not required for the wireless facility at the time it was constructed or modified.

e.    Project Plans. A fully dimensioned, and full color, site plan and elevation drawings prepared and sealed by a California-licensed engineer showing any existing wireless facilities with all existing transmission equipment and other improvements, the proposed facility with all proposed transmission equipment and other improvements and the legal boundaries of the leased or owned area surrounding the proposed facility and any associated access or utility easements. The plans must specifically depict and call out the original overall height of the structure and, if the structure was constructed prior to February 22, 2012, the overall height that existed on February 22, 2012. The plans must contain all other elements and details required for site plans submitted with a permit application pursuant to a conditional use permit.

f.    Site Photos and Photo Simulations. Photographs and photo simulations that show the proposed facility in context of the site from reasonable line-of-sight locations from public streets or other adjacent viewpoints, together with a map that shows the photo location of each view angle.

g.    RF Compliance Demonstration. An RF exposure compliance report prepared and certified by an RF engineer acceptable to the city that certifies that the proposed facility, as well as any collocated facilities, will comply with applicable federal RF exposure standards and exposure limits. The RF report must include the actual frequency and power levels (in watts effective radiated power (ERP)) for all existing and proposed antennas at the site and exhibits that show the location and orientation of all transmitting antennas and the boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess of the uncontrolled/general population limit (as that term is defined by the FCC) and also the boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess of the controlled/occupational limit (as that term is defined by the FCC). Each such boundary shall be clearly marked and identified for every transmitting antenna at the project site.

h.    Acoustic Analysis. A written report that analyzes acoustic levels for the proposed facility and all associated equipment including without limitation all environmental control units, sump pumps, temporary backup power generators, and permanent backup power generators in order to demonstrate compliance with Chapter 17.50 (Noise). The acoustic analysis must be prepared and certified by an engineer and include an analysis of the manufacturers’ specifications for all noise-emitting equipment and a depiction of the proposed equipment relative to all adjacent property lines. In lieu of a written report, the applicant may submit evidence from the equipment manufacturer that the ambient noise emitted from all the proposed equipment will not, both individually and cumulatively, exceed the applicable limits.

i.    Section 6409(a) Justification Analysis. A written statement that explains in plain factual detail whether and why Section 6409(a) and the related FCC regulations at 47 CFR 1.40001 et seq. require approval for the specific project. A complete written narrative analysis will state the applicable standard and all the facts that allow the city to conclude the standard has been met—bare conclusions not factually supported do not constitute a complete written analysis. As part of this written statement the applicant must also include (i) whether and why the support structure qualifies as an existing tower or existing base station; and (ii) whether and why the proposed collocation or modification does not cause a substantial change in height, width, excavation, equipment cabinets, concealment or permit compliance.

3.    Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. The city shall not review any application unless duly filed in accordance with the provisions in this subsection (E)(3).

a.    Pre-Submittal Conference. Before application submittal, applicants must schedule and attend a pre-application meeting with city staff for all proposed modifications submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a). Applicants must also pay the applicable fee for a pre-submittal conference. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification, including whether the project qualifies for Section 6409(a); any latent issues in connection with the existing tower or base station; potential concealment issues (if applicable); coordination with other city departments responsible for application review; and application completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that city staff may provide informal feedback about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The zoning administrator may, in the zoning administrator’s discretion, grant a written exemption to the submittal appointment under subsection (E)(3)(b) of this section and/or for a specific requirement for a complete application to any applicant who (i) schedules, attends and fully participates in any pre-submittal conference and (ii) shows to the zoning administrator’s satisfaction that such specific requirement duplicates information already provided in other materials to be submitted or is otherwise unnecessary to the city’s review under facts and circumstances in that particular case. Any written exemption will be limited to the project discussed at the pre-submittal conference and will not be extended to any other project.

b.    Submittal Appointment. All applications must be filed with the city at a pre-scheduled appointment. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment, but may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not prejudicial to other applicants. Any application received without an appointment, whether delivered in person or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the zoning administrator at a pre-submittal conference.

c.    Appointment Scheduling Procedures. For any event in the submittal process that requires an appointment, applicants must submit a written request to the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment as soon as reasonably feasible and within five business days after a written request is received.

4.    Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely decisions, and in accordance with Section 17.16.030(D), an application will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a substantive response to the city within sixty calendar days after the city deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The zoning administrator may, in the zoning administrator’s discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional thirty calendar days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the sixtieth day that shows good cause to grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant’s reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension.

5.    Departmental Rules. The city council authorizes the city manager to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular hours for appointments with applicants, as the city manager deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process. All such rules and regulations must be in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice.

F.    Decisions.

1.    Decision Notices. Within five working days after the approving authority approves, conditionally approves or denies an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) or before the FCC time frame for review expires (whichever occurs first), the approving authority shall send a written notice to the applicant and all other parties entitled to receive notice. In the event that the approving authority determines that an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) does not qualify for approval, the approving authority will send written notice to the applicant that includes the reasons to support the approving authority’s decision and states that the application will be automatically denied without prejudice on the sixtieth day after the date the application was filed unless the applicant withdraws the application.

2.    Required Findings for Approval. The approving authority may approve or conditionally approve an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) when it finds that the proposed project:

a.    Involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission equipment on an existing wireless tower or base station; and

b.    Does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the existing wireless tower or base station.

3.    Criteria for Denial. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this section, and consistent with all applicable federal laws and regulations, the approving authority may deny an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) when it finds that the proposed project:

a.    Does not satisfy the criteria for approval;

b.    Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition reasonably related to public health and safety then in effect; or

c.    Involves the replacement of the entire support structure.

4.    Conditional Approvals. Subject to any applicable limitations in federal or state law, nothing in this section is intended to limit the zoning administrator’s authority to conditionally approve an application for a Section 6409(a) approval to protect and promote the public health and safety.

5.    Appeals. Any applicant may appeal the zoning administrator’s decision to deny without prejudice a Section 6409(a) application. The appeal must be filed within ten days from the zoning administrator’s decision. The appeal must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The city manager shall serve as the appellate authority for all appeals of all actions of the zoning administrator taken pursuant to this section. The city manager shall limit its review to whether the project should be approved or denied in accordance with the provisions in subsections (F)(2) and (3) of this section. The decision of the city manager shall be final and not subject to any further administrative appeals.

G.    Standard Conditions of Approval. In addition to all other conditions adopted by the approving authority, all conditional use permits and administrative use permits, whether approved by the approving authority or deemed approved by the operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the conditions in this subsection G. The approving authority shall have discretion to modify the conditions in this subsection G on a case-by-case basis as the approval authority deems necessary or appropriate to enable the proper operation of the wireless facility and promote public health and safety, and to advance the purposes in this section.

1.    Permit Term. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) approval constitutes a federally mandated modification to the underlying permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) approval will not extend the permit term, if any, for any administrative use permit, conditional use permit or other underlying prior regulatory authorization. Accordingly, the term for a Section 6409(a) approval shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station.

2.    Accelerated Permit Terms Due to Invalidation. In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of Section 6409(a) or any FCC rule that interprets Section 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate approval for any Section 6409(a) approval(s), such approval(s) shall automatically expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order, unless the decision would not authorize accelerated termination of previously approved Section 6409(a) approvals or the zoning administrator grants an extension upon written request from the permittee that shows good cause for the extension, which includes without limitation extreme financial hardship. Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the contrary, the zoning administrator may not grant a permanent exemption or indefinite extension. A permittee shall not be required to remove its improvements approved under the invalidated Section 6409(a) approval when it has submitted an application for either an administrative use permit or conditional use permit for those improvements before the one-year period ends.

3.    No Waiver of Standing. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) approval does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) or any Section 6409(a) approval.

4.    Approved Plans and Photo Simulations. Before the permittee submits any applications to the building division, the permittee must incorporate this Section 6409(a) approval, all conditions associated with this Section 6409(a) approval and the approved photo simulations into the project plans (the “approved plans”). The permittee must construct, install and operate the facility in strict compliance with the approved plans. Any alterations, modifications or other changes to the approved plans, whether requested by the permittee or required by other departments or public agencies with jurisdiction over the facility, must be submitted in a written request subject to the zoning administrator’s prior review and approval, who may revoke the Section 6409(a) approval if the zoning administrator finds that the requested alteration, modification or other change may cause a substantial change as that term is defined by the FCC in 47 CFR 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended.

5.    Build-Out Period. This Section 6409(a) approval will automatically expire one year from the issuance date unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals required to install, construct and/or operate the approved facility, which includes without limitation any permits or approvals required by any federal, state or local public agencies with jurisdiction over the subject property, the facility or its use. The zoning administrator may grant one written extension to a date certain not exceeding one year from the permit issuance date when the permittee shows good cause to extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension submitted at least thirty days prior to the automatic expiration date in this condition.

6.    Maintenance Obligations—Vandalism. The permittee shall keep the site, which includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the approved plans and all conditions in this Section 6409(a) approval. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the city, shall remove and remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within forty-eight hours after the permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred.

7.    Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all times with all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other rules that carry the force of law (“laws”) applicable to the permittee, the subject property, the facility or any use or activities in connection with the use authorized in this Section 6409(a) approval. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen the permittee’s obligations to maintain compliance with all laws.

8.    Adverse Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall use all reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may arise from the permittee’s construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal and/or other activities at the site. The permittee may only perform or cause others to perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines between seven o’clock a.m. and six o’clock p.m. weekdays or on Saturday from eight o’clock a.m. to five o’clock p.m. No work described above shall be done on Sunday or any city, state or federal holiday. The restricted work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency declared by the city. The zoning administrator or the zoning administrator’s designee may issue a stop work order for any work that violates this condition.

9.    Noise Complaints. The permittee shall conduct all activities on the site in compliance with the ambient noise standards in Chapter 17.50 (Noise) applicable to location in which the wireless facility is located. In the event that any person files a noise complaint and the city verifies that such complaint is valid, the permittee must remedy the violation within ten days after notice from the city, which may include a demonstration that the permittee has amended its operational guidelines in situations where the violation arises from the permittee’s personnel rather than the permittee’s equipment.

10.    Inspections—Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city or its designee may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the city or its designee may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair, disable or remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee will be permitted to supervise the city or its designee while such inspection or emergency access occurs.

11.    Contact Information. The permittee shall furnish the development services department with accurate and up-to-date contact information for a person responsible for the facility, which includes without limitation such person’s full name, title, direct telephone number, facsimile number, mailing address and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date at all times.

12.    Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property owner upon which the facility is installed shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, its agents, officers, officials, employees and volunteers from any and all (a) damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, writs and other actions or proceedings (“claims”) brought against the city or its agents, officers, officials, employees or volunteers to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the city’s approval of this Section 6409(a) approval, and (b) other claims of any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, that arise from or in connection with the permittee’s or its agents’, directors’, officers’, employees’, contractors’, subcontractors’, licensees’, or customers’ acts or omissions in connection with this Section 6409(a) approval or the facility. In the event the city becomes aware of any claims, the city will use best efforts to promptly notify the permittee and the private property owner and shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city shall have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal counsel providing the city’s defense, and the property owner and/or permittee (as applicable) shall promptly reimburse city for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by the city in the course of the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the permittee’s indemnification obligations under this condition are a material consideration that motivates the city to approve this Section 6409(a) approval, and that such indemnification obligations will survive the expiration or revocation of this Section 6409(a) approval.

13.    Performance Bond. Before the development services department issues any construction permit in connection with the facility, the permittee shall post a performance bond from a surety and in a form acceptable to the city manager in an amount equal to or greater than a written estimate from a qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities removal. The written estimate must include the cost to remove all equipment and other improvements, which includes without limitation all antennas, radios, batteries, generators, utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets, hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters, towers, poles, footings and foundations, whether above ground or below ground, constructed or installed in connection with the facility. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under this condition, and in accordance with California Government Code Section 65964(a), the city manager shall take into consideration information provided by the permittee regarding the cost to remove the facility.

14.    Revocation. The original approving authority may recall this Section 6409(a) approval for review at any time due to complaints about noncompliance with the applicable provisions in the San Pablo Municipal Code or any approval conditions. At a duly noticed public hearing and in accordance with all applicable laws, the zoning administrator may revoke this Section 6409(a) approval or amend these conditions as the zoning administrator deems necessary or appropriate to correct any such noncompliance.

15.    Record Retention. The permittee must maintain complete and accurate copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the facility, which includes without limitation this approval, the approved plans and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all conditions associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or approvals issued in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not maintain such records as required in this condition, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the permittee.

H.    Compliance Obligations. An applicant or permittee will not be relieved of its obligation to comply with every applicable provision in the San Pablo Municipal Code, this section, any permit, any permit condition or any applicable law or regulation by reason of any failure by the city to timely notice, prompt or enforce compliance by the applicant or permittee. (Ord. 2017-003 § 5, 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.62.300 Wireless facilities—New and substantially changed facilities.
A.    Legislative Intent. The city of San Pablo intends this section to establish reasonable and uniform standards and procedures for wireless facilities deployment, construction, installation, collocation, modification, operation, relocation and removal within the city’s territorial boundaries, consistent with and to the extent permitted under federal and California State law. The standards and procedures contained in this section are intended to, and should be applied to, protect and promote public health, safety and welfare, and also balance the benefits that flow from robust, advanced wireless services with the city’s local values, which include without limitation the aesthetic character of the city, its neighborhoods and community. This section is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or applied to: (1) prohibit or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service provider’s ability to provide personal wireless services; (2) prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity’s ability to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service, subject to any competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory rules or regulation for rights-of-way management; (3) unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; (4) deny any request for authorization to place, construct or modify personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Federal Communications Commission’s regulations concerning such emissions; (5) prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny under federal or California State law; or (6) otherwise authorize the city to preempt any applicable federal or California State law.

b.    Title Report and Owner’s Authorization. The applicant must provide a title report prepared within the six months prior to the application filing date in order for the city to verify the property owner’s identity. If the applicant does not own the subject property, the application must include a written authorization signed by the property owner that empowers the applicant to file the application and perform all facility construction, installation, operation and maintenance to the extent described in the application.

c.    Regulatory Authorizations. To the extent that the applicant claims any regulatory authorization or other right to use the public rights-of-way, such as a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the applicant must provide a true and correct copy of the certificate, license, notice to proceed or other regulatory authorization that supports the applicant’s claim.

d.    Project Plans. A fully dimensioned, and full color, site plan and elevation drawings prepared and sealed by a California-licensed engineer showing any existing wireless facilities with all existing transmission equipment and other improvements, the proposed facility with all proposed transmission equipment and other improvements and the legal boundaries of the leased or owned area surrounding the proposed facility and any associated access or utility easements. The plans must contain all other elements and details required for site plans submitted with an administrative use, temporary use or conditional use permit application, as applicable.

e.    Site Photos and Photo Simulations. Photographs and photo simulations that show the proposed facility in context of the site from reasonable line-of-sight locations from public streets or other adjacent viewpoints, together with a map that shows the photo location of each view angle.

f.    RF Compliance Demonstration. An RF exposure compliance report prepared and certified by an RF engineer acceptable to the city that certifies that the proposed facility, as well as any collocated facilities, will comply with applicable federal RF exposure standards and exposure limits. The RF report must include the actual frequency and power levels (in watts effective radiated power (ERP)) for all existing and proposed antennas at the site and exhibits that show the location and orientation of all transmitting antennas and the boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess of the uncontrolled/general population limit (as that term is defined by the FCC) and also the boundaries of areas with RF exposures in excess of the controlled/occupational limit (as that term is defined by the FCC). Each such boundary shall be clearly marked and identified for every transmitting antenna at the project site.

g.    Acoustic Analysis. A written report that analyzes acoustic levels for the proposed facility and all associated equipment including without limitation all environmental control units, sump pumps, temporary backup power generators, and permanent backup power generators in order to demonstrate compliance with Chapter 17.50 (Noise). The acoustic analysis must be prepared and certified by an engineer and include an analysis of the manufacturers’ specifications for all noise-emitting equipment and a depiction of the proposed equipment relative to all adjacent property lines.

i.    Alternatives Analysis. The applicant must list all existing structures considered as alternatives to the proposed location, together with a general description of the site design considered at each location. The applicant must also provide a written explanation for why the alternatives considered, such as collocation, were unacceptable or infeasible, unavailable or not as consistent with the development standards in this section as the proposed location and design. This explanation must include a meaningful comparative analysis and such technical information and other factual justification as are necessary to document the reasons why each alternative is unacceptable, infeasible, unavailable or not as consistent with the development standards in this section as the proposed location. If an existing facility is listed among the alternatives, the applicant must specifically address why the collocation or modification of such wireless facility is not a viable option. If the proposed location is in the public right-of-way, the applicant may perform the alternatives sites analysis on other locations that it considered in the public right-of-way.

3.    Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. The city shall not review any application unless duly filed in accordance with the provisions in this subsection (E)(3).

a.    Pre-Submittal Conference. Before application submittal, applicants must schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference with city staff for all proposed facilities that require an administrative or conditional use permit. The city strongly encourages, but does not require, a pre-submittal conference for all other proposed facilities. Applicants must also pay the applicable fee for a pre-submittal conference. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification and permit requirements, concealment opportunities and/or concerns, potential alternative sites and/or designs, requirements for a complete application, scheduling matters and coordination with other city departments responsible for application review. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that city staff may provide informal feedback about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The zoning administrator may, in the zoning administrator’s discretion, grant a written exemption to the submittal appointment under subsection (E)(3)(b) of this section and/or for a specific requirement for a complete application to any applicant who (i) schedules, attends and fully participates in any pre-submittal conference and (ii) shows to the zoning administrator’s satisfaction that such specific requirement duplicates information already provided in other materials to be submitted or is otherwise unnecessary to the city’s review under facts and circumstances in that particular case. Any written exemption will be limited to the project discussed at the pre-submittal conference and will not be extended to any other project.

b.    Submittal Appointment. All applications must be filed with the city at a pre-scheduled appointment. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment, but may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not prejudicial to other applicants. Any application received without an appointment, whether delivered in person or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the zoning administrator at a pre-submittal conference.

c.    Appointment Scheduling Procedures. For any event in the submittal process that requires an appointment, applicants must submit a written request to the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment as soon as reasonably feasible and within five business days after a written request is received.

4.    Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely decisions, and in accordance with Section 17.16.030(D), an application will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a substantive response to the city within sixty calendar days after the city deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The zoning administrator may, in the zoning administrator’s discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional thirty calendar days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the sixtieth day that shows good cause to grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant’s reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension.

5.    Departmental Rules. The city council authorizes the city manager to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular hours for appointments with applicants, as the city manager deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process. All such rules and regulations must be in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice.

F.    Decisions.

1.    Notice.

a.    General Notice Required for the Application. Public notice as provided in Section 17.16.050 (Public hearing and public notice) will be required for any conditional use permit. The approving authority shall not act on any application for a wireless facility unless the public notice required by law has occurred.

b.    Deemed-Approval Notice Procedures. Not more than thirty days before the applicable FCC time frame for review expires, and in addition to the public notice required in Section 17.16.050 (Public hearing and public notice) if applicable, an applicant for a conditional use permit or administrative use permit must provide a posted notice at the project site that states the project will be automatically deemed approved pursuant to California Government Code Section 65964.1 unless the city approves or denies the application or the applicant tolls the time frame for review within the next thirty days. The posted notice must be compliant with the notice content requirements in Section 17.16.050(B). The public notice required under this subsection (F)(1)(b) will be deemed given when the applicant delivers written notice to the zoning administrator that shows the appropriate notice has been posted at the project site.

c.    Decision Notices. Within five working days after the approving authority approves, conditionally approves or denies an application for a wireless facility or before the FCC time frame for review expires (whichever occurs first), the approving authority shall send a written notice to the applicant and all other parties entitled to receive notice. For any denial notice, the approving authority shall include the reasons for the denial either in the notice or as a separate written document.

2.    Required Findings for Approval. The approving authority may approve or conditionally approve a duly filed application for a conditional use permit or administrative use permit only when the approving authority finds:

a.    The proposed wireless facility complies with all the criteria for a conditional use permit or administrative use permit in accordance with Section 17.20.040(B) or 17.18.080(D), as applicable;

b.    The proposed wireless facility complies with all applicable development standards described in subsection H of this section;

c.    The applicant has demonstrated that its proposed facility will be in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations for human exposure to RF emissions;

d.    The applicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort to identify and evaluate more preferred locations, collocations and potentially less intrusive designs;

e.    The applicant has provided the approving authority with a meaningful comparative analysis that shows all less intrusive alternative locations and designs identified in the administrative record are either technically infeasible or not potentially available.

3.    Conditional Approvals. The approving authority may impose any reasonable conditions on any conditional use permit or administrative use permit, related and proportionate to the subject matter in the application, as the approving authority deems necessary or appropriate to promote and ensure conformance with the general plan, any applicable specific plan and the provisions in this section.

4.    Limited Exception for Personal Wireless Service Facilities. The planning commission shall not grant any limited exception pursuant to this subsection (F)(4) unless the planning commission finds all the following:

a.    The proposed facility qualifies as a “personal wireless service facility” as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(C)(ii), as may be amended or superseded;

b.    The applicant has provided the planning commission with a reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed facility;

c.    The applicant has provided the planning commission with a written statement that contains a detailed and fact-specific explanation as to why the proposed facility cannot be deployed in compliance with the applicable provisions in this section, the San Pablo Municipal Code, the general plan and/or any specific plan;

d.    The applicant has provided the planning commission with a meaningful comparative analysis with the factual reasons why all alternative locations and/or designs identified in the administrative record (whether suggested by the applicant, the city, public comments or any other source) are not technically feasible or potentially available to reasonably achieve the applicant’s reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed facility; and

e.    The applicant has demonstrated that the proposed location and design is the least noncompliant configuration that will reasonably achieve the applicant’s reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed facility, which includes without limitation a meaningful comparative analysis into multiple smaller or less intrusive facilities dispersed throughout the intended service area.

5.    Appeals. Any interested person or entity may appeal a decision by the approving authority in accordance with the provisions in Section 17.16.080 (Appeals). Within thirty days after an appeal is filed, the appeal authority shall hold a de novo public hearing to consider and act on the application in accordance with the applicable provisions in this section, the San Pablo Municipal Code and the general plan.

G.    Site Location Guidelines.

1.    Preferred Locations. All applicants must, to the extent feasible, propose new facilities in locations according to the following preferences, ordered from most preferred to least preferred. Facilities proposed to be sited in the following locations may be eligible for an administrative use permit.

a.    City-owned properties;

b.    City-owned structures in the public right-of-way;

c.    Parcels within industrial zones;

d.    Parcels within commercial sites;

2.    Preferred Support Structures. In addition to the preferred locations described in subsection (G)(1) of this section, the city also expresses its preference for installations on certain support structures. In any zone, whether preferred or not preferred, the city will consider whether any more preferred support structure is available.

a.    Collocations with existing building-mounted or water-tank-mounted wireless facilities;

b.    Collocations with existing wireless facilities on electric transmission towers;

c.    Collocations with existing freestanding wireless facilities;

e.    New installations on existing electric transmission towers;

f.    New freestanding wireless towers.

H.    Design Standards.

1.    Generally Applicable Development Standards. All new wireless facilities and all collocations or modifications to existing wireless facilities not subject to Section 6409(a) must conform to the generally applicable development standards in this subsection H.

a.    Concealment. Wireless facilities must incorporate concealment elements, measures and techniques that blend the equipment and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment in a manner consistent and/or compatible with the uses germane to the underlying zoning district and existing in the immediate vicinity.

b.    Overall Height. Wireless facilities may not exceed the applicable height limit for structures in the applicable zoning district.

c.    Setbacks. Wireless facilities may not encroach into any applicable setback for structures in the subject zoning district.

d.    Noise. Wireless facilities and all accessory equipment and transmission equipment must comply with all noise regulations, which includes without limitation Chapter 17.50 (Noise), and shall not exceed, either individually or cumulatively, the applicable ambient noise limit in the subject zoning district. The approving authority may require the applicant to incorporate appropriate noise-baffling materials and/or strategies whenever necessary to avoid any ambient noise from equipment reasonably likely to exceed the applicable limit.

e.    Landscaping. Wireless facilities must include landscape features when proposed in a landscaped area. The approving authority may require additional landscape features, and an ongoing landscape maintenance plan, to screen the facility from public view, avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts on adjacent properties or otherwise enhance the concealment required under this section.

f.    Security Measures. Wireless facilities may incorporate reasonable and appropriate security measures, such as fences, walls and anti-climbing devices, to prevent unauthorized access, theft and vandalism. Security measures must be designed to enhance concealment to the maximum extent possible. The approving authority may require additional concealment elements as the approving authority finds necessary to blend the security measures and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment. The approving authority shall not approve barbed wire, razor ribbon, electrified fences or any similar security measures.

g.    Backup Power Sources. The approving authority may approve permanent backup power sources and/or generators on a case-by-case basis. The city strongly disfavors backup power sources mounted on the ground or on poles in the public rights-of-way. The approving authority shall not approve any diesel generators or other similarly noisy or noxious generators in or within one thousand feet from any residential dwelling; provided, however, the approving authority may approve sockets or other connections used for temporary backup generators within the one-thousand-foot setback.

h.    Lights. Wireless facilities may not include exterior lights other than (i) as may be required under FAA, FCC or other applicable governmental regulations; and (ii) timed or motion-sensitive lights for security and/or worker safety. All exterior lights permitted or required to be installed must be installed in locations and within enclosures that avoid illumination impacts on other properties.

i.    Signage—Advertisements. All wireless facilities must include signage that accurately identifies the equipment owner/operator, the owner’s/operator’s site name or identification number and a toll-free number to the owner’s/operator’s network operations center. Wireless facilities may not bear any other signage or advertisements unless expressly approved by the city, required by law or recommended under FCC or other United States governmental agencies for compliance with RF emissions regulations.

j.    Future Collocations. All wireless facilities must be designed and sited in a manner that contemplates future collocations, and will facilitate additional equipment to be integrated into the proposed facility or associated structures with no or negligible visual changes to its outward appearance to the greatest extent feasible.

k.    Utilities. All cables and connectors for telephone, primary electric and other similar utility services must be routed underground to the extent feasible in conduits large enough to accommodate future collocated facilities. The approving authority shall not approve new overhead utility lines or service drops merely because compliance with the undergrounding requirements would increase the project cost.

l.    Compliance with Laws. All wireless facilities must be designed and sited in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules, restrictions and conditions, which includes without limitation the California Building Standards Code, general plan and any specific plan, the city municipal code and any conditions or restrictions in any permit or other governmental approval issued by any public agency with jurisdiction over the project.

2.    Freestanding Facilities.

a.    Tower-Mounted Equipment. All tower-mounted equipment must be mounted as close to the vertical support structure as possible to reduce its visual profile. Applicants must mount non-antenna, tower-mounted equipment (including, but not limited to, remote radio units/heads, surge suppressors and utility demarcation boxes) directly behind the antennas to the maximum extent feasible. All tower-mounted equipment, cables and hardware must be painted with flat colors subject to the approving authority’s prior approval.

b.    Ground-Mounted Equipment and Shelters. All ground-mounted equipment must be concealed within an existing or new structure, opaque fences or other enclosures subject to the approving authority’s prior approval. The approving authority may require additional concealment elements as the approving authority finds necessary to blend the ground-mounted equipment and other improvements into the natural and/or built environment.

3.    Building-Mounted Facilities.

a.    Preferred Concealment Techniques. All applicants should, to the extent feasible, propose new nontower facilities that are completely concealed and architecturally integrated into the existing facade or rooftop features with no visible impacts from any publicly accessible areas at ground level (examples include, but are not limited to, antennas concealed behind, and not above, existing parapet walls or facades replaced with RF-transparent material and finished to mimic the replaced materials). Alternatively, when integration with existing building features is not feasible, the applicant should propose completely concealed new structures or appurtenances designed to mimic the support structure’s original architecture and proportions (examples include, but are not limited to, cupolas, steeples, chimneys and water tanks).

b.    Facade-Mounted Equipment. All facade-mounted equipment must be concealed behind screen walls and mounted as flush to the facade as practicable. The approving authority may not approve “pop-out” screen boxes unless the design is architecturally consistent with the original building or support structure. Except in industrial zones, the approving authority may not approve any exposed facade-mounted antennas, including but not limited to exposed antennas painted to match the facade.

c.    Rooftop-Mounted Equipment. All rooftop-mounted equipment must be screened from public view with concealment measures that match the underlying structure in proportion, quality, architectural style and finish and color. The approving authority may approve unscreened rooftop equipment only when it expressly finds that such equipment is effectively concealed due to its low height and/or setback from the roofline.

d.    Associated Ground-Mounted Equipment. Outdoor ground-mounted equipment associated with building-mounted facilities must be avoided whenever feasible. In publicly visible or accessible locations, applicants must conceal outdoor ground-mounted equipment with opaque fences or landscape features that mimic the adjacent structure(s) such as dumpster corrals and other accessory structures.

4.    Right-of-Way Facilities.

a.    Concealment. All wireless facilities in the right-of-way must be concealed to the maximum extent feasible with design elements and techniques that mimic or blend with the underlying support structure, surrounding environment and adjacent uses. In addition, wireless facilities in the rights-of-way may not unreasonably subject the public use, for any purpose including expressive or aesthetic purposes, to inconvenience, discomfort, trouble, annoyance, hindrance, impediment or obstruction.

b.    Support Structures. All wireless facilities in the public right-of-way must be installed on existing above-ground structures whenever possible and desirable. Existing above-ground structures may be replaced with hardened support structures so long as the replacement structure is substantially similar to the existing structure to be replaced. The approving authority shall not approve any new, nonreplacement support structures unless: (i) the applicant demonstrates that above-ground support structures near the project site either do not exist or are not available to the applicant; or (ii) the approving authority finds that a new, nonreplacement support structure would be more desirable and consistent with the objectives in this section than installations on existing structures near the project site.

c.    Undergrounded Equipment. To conceal the non-antenna equipment, applicants for a proposed facility within any area in which the existing utilities are primarily located underground shall underground all nonantenna equipment other than any required electric meter or disconnect switch. In all other areas, applicants shall install all non-antenna equipment underground to the extent feasible or effectively required to maintain pedestrian access as may be required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or other applicable law. Additional expense to install and maintain an underground equipment enclosure does not exempt an applicant from this requirement, except where the applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that this requirement will effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services.

d.    Pole-Mounted Equipment. All pole-mounted equipment must be installed as close to the pole as technically and legally feasible to minimize impacts to the visual profile. All required or permitted signage in the rights-of-way must face toward the street or otherwise placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures. All conduits, conduit attachments, cables, wires and other connectors must be concealed from public view to the extent feasible.

e.    Ground-Mounted Equipment. To the extent that the equipment cannot be placed underground as required, applicants must install ground-mounted equipment in the location so that it does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic. The approving authority may require landscaping as a condition of approval to conceal ground-mounted equipment.

I.    Standard Conditions of Approval. In addition to all other conditions adopted by the approving authority, all conditional use permits and administrative use permits, whether approved by the approving authority or deemed approved by the operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the conditions in this subsection I. The approving authority shall have discretion to modify the conditions in this subsection I on a case-by-case basis as the approval authority deems necessary or appropriate to enable the proper operation of the wireless facility and promote public health, safety and welfare.

1.    Approved Plans. Before the permittee submits any applications to the building division, the permittee must incorporate this permit, all conditions associated with this permit and the approved photo simulations into the project plans (the “approved plans”). The permittee must construct, install and operate the facility in strict compliance with the approved plans. Any alterations, modifications or other changes to the approved plans, whether requested by the permittee or required by other departments or public agencies with jurisdiction over the facility, must be submitted in a written request subject to the zoning administrator’s prior review and approval, who may refer the request to the original approving authority if the zoning administrator finds that the requested alteration, modification or other change implicates a significant or substantial land-use concern.

2.    Permit Duration. This permit will automatically expire ten years and one day from its issuance, except when California Government Code Section 65964(b), as may be amended or superseded in the future, authorizes the city to establish a shorter term for public safety or substantial land use reasons. Any other permits or approvals issued in connection with any collocation, modification or other change to this facility, which includes without limitation any permits or other approvals deemed granted or deemed approved under federal or state law, will not extend this term limit unless expressly provided otherwise in such permit or approval or required under federal or state law.

3.    Build-Out Period. This permit will automatically expire one year from the issuance date unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals required to install, construct and/or operate the approved facility, which includes without limitation any permits or approvals required by any federal, state or local public agencies with jurisdiction over the subject property, the facility or its use. The zoning administrator may grant one written extension to a date certain not exceeding one year from the permit issuance date when the permittee shows good cause to extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension submitted at least thirty days prior to the automatic expiration date in this condition.

4.    Concealment Elements. The permittee acknowledges that (a) the San Pablo Municipal Code requires all wireless facilities to incorporate concealment elements to the maximum extent feasible; (b) concealment elements may take many different forms; and (c) although the city may occasionally discuss specific concealment elements, it would be impractical and administratively difficult to enumerate or articulate each individual concealment element on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that each design element and/or feature, which includes without limitation any screening, painting, texturing, proportionality or similarity with other natural features or manmade structures in the vicinity or placement within existing structures, that directly or indirectly mitigates, diminishes, reduces, avoids, alleviates or otherwise lessens the facility’s visual impact or blends the facility into the natural or built environment is deemed to be a concealment element for all purposes, whether expressly stated as such in the administrative record or not.

5.    Maintenance Obligations—Vandalism. The permittee shall keep the site, which includes without limitation any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the approved plans and all conditions in this permit. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the city, shall remove and remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within forty-eight hours after the permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred.

6.    Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all times with all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other rules that carry the force of law (“laws”) applicable to the permittee, the subject property, the facility or any use or activities in connection with the use authorized in this permit. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen the permittee’s obligations to maintain compliance with all laws.

7.    Adverse Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall use all reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may arise from the permittee’s construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal and/or other activities at the site. The permittee may only perform or cause others to perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines between seven o’clock a.m. and six o’clock p.m. weekdays or on Saturday from eight o’clock a.m. to five o’clock p.m. No work described above shall be done on Sunday or any city, state or federal holiday. The restricted work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency declared by the city. The zoning administrator or the zoning administrator’s designee may issue a stop work order for any work that violates this condition.

8.    Noise Complaints. The permittee shall conduct all activities on the site in compliance with the ambient noise standards in Chapter 17.50 (Noise) applicable to zone or district in which the facility is located. In the event that any person files a noise complaint and the city verifies that such complaint is valid, the permittee must remedy the violation within ten days after notice from the city, which may include a demonstration that the permittee has amended its operational guidelines in situations where the violation arises from the permittee’s personnel rather than the permittee’s equipment.

9.    Inspections—Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city or its designee may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the city or its designee may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair, disable or remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee will be permitted to supervise the city or its designee while such inspection or emergency access occurs.

10.    Contact Information. The permittee shall furnish the development services department with accurate and up-to-date contact information for a person responsible for the facility, which includes without limitation such person’s full name, title, direct telephone number, facsimile number, mailing address and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date at all times.

11.    Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property owner upon which the facility is installed shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, its agents, officers, officials, employees and volunteers from any and all (a) damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, writs and other actions or proceedings (“claims”) brought against the city or its agents, officers, officials, employees or volunteers to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the city’s approval of this permit, and (b) other claims any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, that arise from or in connection with the permittee’s or its agents’, directors’, officers’, employees’, contractors’, subcontractors’, licensees’, or customers’ acts or omissions in connection with this permit or the facility. In the event the city becomes aware of any claims, the city will use best efforts to promptly notify the permittee and the private property owner and shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the city shall have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal counsel providing the city’s defense, and the property owner and/or permittee (as applicable) shall promptly reimburse city for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by the city in the course of the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the permittee’s indemnification obligations under this condition are a material consideration that motivates the city to approve this permit, and that such indemnification obligations will survive the expiration or revocation of this permit.

12.    Performance Bond. Before the building division issues any construction permit in connection with the facility, the permittee shall post a performance bond from a surety and in a form acceptable to the city manager in an amount equal to or greater than a written estimate from a qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities removal. The written estimate must include the cost to remove all equipment and other improvements, which includes without limitation all antennas, radios, batteries, generators, utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets, hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters, towers, poles, footings and foundations, whether above ground or below ground, constructed or installed in connection with the facility. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under this condition, and in accordance with California Government Code Section 65964(a), the city manager shall take into consideration information provided by the permittee regarding the cost to remove the facility.

13.    Revocation. The original approving authority may recall this permit for review at any time due to complaints about noncompliance with the applicable provisions of the San Pablo Municipal Code or any approval conditions. At a duly noticed public hearing and in accordance with all applicable laws, the approving authority may revoke this permit or amend these conditions as the approving authority deems necessary or appropriate to correct any such noncompliance.

14.    Record Retention. The permittee shall retain full and complete copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the facility, which includes without limitation all conditions of approval, approved plans, resolutions and other documentation associated with the permit or regulatory approval. In the event that the city cannot locate any such full and complete permits or other regulatory approvals in its official records, and the permittee fails to retain full and complete permits or other regulatory approvals in the permittee’s files, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an examination of the missing documents will be conclusively resolved against the permittee.

15.    Undergrounded Utilities. In the event that other public utilities or cable television operators in the public right-of-way where the permittee’s wireless facility is located underground their facilities, the permittee for such wireless facility located in the public right-of-way must underground its equipment except the antennas and antenna supports. Such undergrounding shall occur at the permittee’s sole cost and expense except as reimbursed pursuant to law. Telecommunications providers must fund their portions of the conversions from above ground to underground facilities either at the time of initial installation or as part of a Rule 20A conversion project for all city of San Pablo underground utility districts (UUDs) qualified under CPUC Rule 32A.1, which includes service routes one hundred feet from the point of service to individual property owners.

16.    Electric Meter Removal. In the event that the commercial electric utility provider provides, adopts or amends rules that obviate the need for a separate electric meter and enclosure, the permittee for a wireless facility located in the public right-of-way that is serviced by such electric meter, on the permittee’s own initiative and at the permittee’s sole cost and expense, shall apply to the city for permission to remove the separate electric meter and enclosure. The permittee shall also restore the area affected by the electric meter to its original condition.

J.    Amortization of Nonconforming Facilities. Any nonconforming facilities in existence at the time this section becomes effective must be brought into conformance with this section in accordance with the amortization schedule in this subsection J. As used in this subsection J, the “fair market value” will be the construction costs listed on the building permit application for the subject facility and the “minimum years” allowed will be measured from the date on which this section becomes effective.

Fair Market Value on Effective Date

Minimum Years Allowed

Less than $50,000     

5

$50,000 to $500,000     

10

Greater than $500,000     

15

The city manager may grant a written extension to a date certain when the facility owner shows (1) a good faith effort to cure nonconformance and (2) extreme economic hardship would result from strict compliance with the amortization schedule. Any extension must be the minimum time period necessary to avoid such extreme economic hardship. The city manager may not grant any permanent exemption from this subsection J.

Nothing in this subsection J is intended to limit any permit term to less than ten years. In the event that the amortization required in this subsection J would reduce the permit term to less than ten years for any permit granted on or after September 29, 2006, then the minimum years allowed will be automatically extended by the difference between ten years and the number of years since the city granted such permit. Nothing in this subsection J is intended or may be applied to prohibit any collocation or modification covered under 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a) on the basis that the subject wireless facility is a legal nonconforming facility.

K.    Temporary Facilities.

1.    Temporary Facilities for Nonemergencies. The zoning administrator may approve or conditionally approve a temporary use permit for a temporary wireless facility only when the zoning administrator finds all the following:

a.    The proposed temporary wireless facility will not exceed fifty feet in overall height above ground level;

b.    The proposed temporary wireless facility complies with all setback requirements applicable to the proposed location;

c.    The proposed temporary wireless facility will not involve any excavation or ground disturbance;

d.    The proposed temporary wireless facility will be compliant with all generally applicable public health and safety laws and regulations, which include without limitation maximum permissible exposure limits for human exposure to RF emissions established by the FCC;

e.    The proposed temporary wireless facility will not create any nuisance or violate any noise limits applicable to the proposed location;

f.    The proposed temporary wireless facility will be identified with a sign that clearly identifies the site operator and contains a working telephone number to a live person who can exert power-down control over the antennas;

g.    The proposed wireless temporary wireless facility will be removed within five days after the approving authority grants the temporary use permit, or such longer time as the approving authority finds reasonably related to the applicant’s need or purpose for the temporary wireless facility;

h.    The applicant has not received any other temporary use permit for substantially the same location within the previous ninety days; and

i.    The applicant has not sought approval for any permanent wireless facility in substantially the same location within the previous three hundred sixty-five days.

2.    Temporary Facilities for Emergencies. Temporary wireless facilities may be placed and operated within the city without a temporary use permit only when a duly authorized federal, state, county or city official declares an emergency within a region that includes the city in whole or in part. Any temporary wireless facilities placed pursuant to this subsection (K)(2) must be removed within five days after the date the emergency is lifted (whichever occurs first). Any person or entity that places temporary wireless facilities pursuant to this subsection (K)(2) must send a written notice that identifies the site location and person responsible for its operation to the zoning administrator as soon as reasonably practicable.

L.    Compliance Obligations. An applicant or permittee will not be relieved of its obligation to comply with every applicable provision in the San Pablo Municipal Code, this section, any permit, any permit condition or any applicable law or regulation by reason of any failure by the city to timely notice, prompt or enforce compliance by the applicant or permittee. (Ord. 2017-003 § 6, 2017)

17.63.010 Purpose and intent.
This chapter regulates and establishes standards for inclusion of art in private development. The council finds that the environment, image, and character of the city would be improved by art and that the impacts associated with new development projects would be mitigated, in part, by provision of art in compliance with this chapter. The city council finds that public art helps make cities more livable and more visually stimulating. The presence of and access to public art enliven the public areas of buildings and their grounds and make them more welcoming. The visual and aesthetic quality of development projects has a significant impact on property values, the local economy and vitality of the city. Public art can illuminate the diversity and history of a community, and foster the economic development of the community. To achieve these goals, public art should be integrated into development projects citywide. For best results, consideration of public art should be integrated into project planning at the earliest possible stage, and the selected artist should become a member of the project’s design team early in the design process. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.020 Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter apply to commercial development, including office and retail uses, and all industrial or light industrial uses, and any commercial portions of any new mixed-use development, with building development costs of two hundred thousand dollars or more. The building development cost shall be as determined by the building official. In the event of multi-phased development, building development cost is based on the cost of all phases, even though all phases may not be completed at the same time. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to residential projects or the residential portions of a mixed-use project.

“Building development costs” shall mean those construction costs as declared on all building permit applications, and as accepted by the building official. Building permit applications shall include, but not be limited to, all building, plumbing, mechanical and electrical permit applications for the project. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.030 Exemptions.
The following shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter:

A.    Remodeling, repair or reconstruction of structures which have been damaged by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or other calamity; although the exemption is not meant to avoid the reconstruction of public art following a calamity;

B.    Financed with Public Funds. Alteration, construction, or repair of structures to perform rehabilitation of private property if that rehabilitation is primarily financed with public funds;

C.    Projects whose primary tasks are seismic retrofit or fire sprinkler installation;

D.    Capital Improvement Projects. Capital improvement projects performed by the city;

E.    Nonprofit Service Providers in Rented Facilities. Alteration projects that are undertaken by nonprofits organized under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code where such nonprofits do not own the building. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.040 Public art requirement.
A.    Provision of Art. Projects subject to this chapter shall provide publicly visible art on site that is equal in value to at least one percent of the building development costs. In some instances, the cost of artwork may not equate precisely to one percent of the building development costs. If the developer does not spend the entire one percent on public art, the remaining amount shall be contributed to the public arts fund.

B.    Alternative to Provision of Art. Developers may choose to make a contribution to the public arts fund in lieu of placing art on their project site. Developers shall allocate an in-lieu amount equal to one percent of the building development costs. The in-lieu fee is to be used for funding of the city’s public art program, as set forth in Section 17.63.090. The in-lieu fee shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit for the project. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.050 Public art criteria and regulations.
A.    For purposes of this chapter, “art” may include works of art that are created uniquely by an artist and integrated into the development project on a large public scale, including but not limited to the following or any combination of the following:

1.    Painting in all media including permanently affixed works such as murals or frescoes;

2.    Prints and drawings;

3.    Reliefs, including carvings, frescoes, mosaics, earth works;

4.    Sculpture, including statues, fountains, kinetic, electronic, mobiles and monuments, or other in any material or combination of materials;

5.    Arches or other structures intended for ornament or commemoration;

6.    Graphic and multi-media, including printmaking, photography, any combination or forms of electronic media in a large public scale;

7.    Mixed or conceptual media in any combination of forms or media including drawings, collages, prints, or the use of sound, light, or water. Water, neon, fiber optic and electronic sculpture generally should not be encouraged due to difficulty of maintenance. Such art may be permitted if adequate assurance of continued maintenance is provided;

8.    Video, electronic, holographic, or digital media;

9.    Crafts both decorative and utilitarian in clay, fiber, wood, metal, glass, plastics and other materials;

10.    Stained glass;

11.    Neon; or

12.    A landscape or architectural feature that has been specifically and originally designed as a unique artistic element for the project and is not a mass production or replication.

B.    The following are not considered public art for the purposes of this chapter:

1.    Directional elements such as super graphics, signage, or color coding except where these elements are integral parts of the original work of art or executed by artists in unique or limited editions;

2.    Objects which are mass produced of standard design such as banners, signs, playground equipment, benches, statuary, street barriers, sidewalk barriers, or fountains;

3.    Reproduction, by mechanical or other means, of original works of art, except in cases of film, video, photography, printmaking, or other media arts. Permitted art may include, however, limited editions controlled by the artists of original prints, cast sculpture, photographs and other art forms;

4.    Decorative, architectural, or functional elements which are not designed by the building architect or landscape architect as an original artistic design feature unique to the project;

5.    Landscape architecture, gardening, or materials, except where these elements are designed by the artist and are integral or part of the work of art created by the artist;

6.    Landscaping required by the city as part of the development entitlements; or

7.    Artwork that is similar to, reminiscent of or based on a corporate logo.

C.    Artist Qualifications. The artist is required to have experience and knowledge of monumental-scale art or murals intended for public viewing. The artist’s qualifications will be evaluated and examples of past work may be reviewed to determine whether or not the artist has appropriate experience for the project. Efforts shall be made to reach out to local artists in San Pablo and the broader San Francisco Bay area.

D.    Artistic Preference. The determination of artistic preferences is primarily a function of the owner or developer of the property. It is the intent of this chapter to provide for the public display of private art on private property without substituting the artistic preferences of the city for those of the owner or developer of the property. All financial arrangements related to the public art are negotiated between the artist and the developer as contracting parties and shall be verified by a written agreement.

E.    Visibility and Locations. Appropriate locations may include, but are not limited to, exterior vehicular entryways to the property, plazas, greenbelts and building facades. The location selected should allow reasonable accessibility to the art, including visibility of the art from the public street. The location shall be exterior and installation of the art piece shall enhance the art and allow for unobstructed public viewing from as many angles as possible. When located in proximity to major traffic thoroughfares, the art should be at a motorist’s scale and oriented toward the view corridor of the motorist. The art shall be an integral part of the landscaping and/or architecture of the buildings.

F.    Proportional Size. The art shall be proportional to the scale of the development and designed to create an artistic, visual and aesthetic impact upon observers. Particularly in locations on major thoroughfares and major intersections, the art should be of such size and nature as to strengthen the urban design and aesthetic quality of life in the community.

G.    Inoffensive. Because the art will necessarily be highly visible to the public, will be associated with city requirements, and because the traveling public will have no real opportunity to avoid the visual aspects of the art, expressions of obvious bad taste or profanity are prohibited. It is the intent of this criterion to address proposed art which by its nature would generally be considered offensive to the public. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.060 Eligible public art expenditures.
A.    Eligible Costs. When calculating the value of an art to be placed on a private development site, eligible costs include purchase price of the art; art consultant fees; installation costs, including transportation of the art to the site, pedestals or display costs; wiring, fixtures and other costs directly related to the installation of lighting the art; and identification plaques.

B.    Ineligible Costs. Ineligible costs include land acquisition, site preparation, travel costs for the artist, architect fees, utility fees associated with the installation or operation of the art, costs associated with dedication ceremonies, publicity, or educational components and operation or maintenance fees and repairs. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.070 Installation and maintenance requirements.
A.    Timing of Installation. If art installation is impracticable prior to the anticipated date of building occupancy, the city manager may allow building occupancy; provided, that the art permit has been issued and the applicant has filed with the city adequate security to guarantee installation of the art. The security may take the form of a bond, letter of credit, cash deposit, or similar security instrument, along with an agreement to install the required art in such amount and form as is acceptable to city manager.

B.    Permanence. The art shall be a permanent, fixed asset to the property. The composition of the art shall be of permanent materials requiring a low level of maintenance. Materials used shall be durable and weather resistant.

C.    Maintenance. The developer and subsequently the property owner shall continuously maintain the public art in good condition after its installation for the life of the project, and shall perform necessary repairs and maintenance to the satisfaction of the city. Maintenance of the art includes related landscaping, lighting and the identification plaque. The repair and maintenance obligations of the property owner shall be contained in a covenant and recorded against the property and shall run with the property.

D.    Plaque Required. Each piece of art shall provide an appropriate identification plaque or monument measuring at least eight inches by eight inches. The plaque shall be made of cast metal and be placed near the art piece. Information is limited to the date, title and artist. The requirement of this subsection may be waived by the city if determined in a particular circumstance to be unnecessary or inconsistent with the intent of this chapter.

E.    Removal. Removal of required art is prohibited without the city’s approval. The city may require replacement of the art. Any removal, relocation, or replacement of the public art must be consistent with the California Preservation of Works of Art Act and the Federal Visual Artists’ Rights Act and any other relevant law. Developer or owner shall execute a restrictive covenant in a form acceptable to the city attorney, enforceable by the city, which shall be recorded against the project site and shall run with the land for a period of twenty years from the installation date. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.080 Art permit approval process.
A.    Art Permit. An art permit is required for installation of public art in private development.

Prior to issuance of the building permit for the development project, the proposed public art must be reviewed and approved by the city council after a recommendation from the planning commission and consultation with the city art curator. The budget for the proposed public art must be approved to ensure that only eligible expenditures are proposed and that such expenditures total the amount of the public art contribution.

B.    Issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for the development project will be conditioned on completion and full installation of the public art at the development site in accordance with the public art permit approved by the city, and confirmation by the city that the developer expended the public art contribution in full on the public art and in accordance with this chapter. However, if art installation is impracticable prior to the anticipated date of building occupancy, the city may allow building occupancy; provided, that the art permit has been issued and the applicant has filed with the city adequate security to guarantee installation of the art. The security may take the form of a bond, letter of credit, cash deposit, or similar security instrument, along with an agreement to install the required art in such amount and form as is acceptable to the city.

C.    Application. The art permit application shall contain the following information:

1.    An application signed by the owner of the affected property;

2.    Landscape and site plans indicating the location and orientation of the art, signage, utility boxes, fire suppression systems, and the landscaping and architectural treatment integrating the piece into the overall project design;

3.    Color elevation rendering clearly showing the artwork to scale in relation to its surroundings;

4.    A sample, model, or photograph and “to-scale” drawings or renderings of the proposed art piece;

5.    Material samples and finishes;

6.    A resume of the proposed artist including slides or photographs of the proposed artist’s past work which demonstrates similar work to the proposal;

7.    A written statement by the artist describing any theme or development of the art;

8.    A lighting plan including samples of lighting fixtures; and

9.    Other information as required by the development services manager.

D.    The application shall be approved, or approved with conditions, upon a finding that the proposed art is consistent with the standards and the purpose of this chapter.

E.    Appeals. Any determination to require public art may be appealed to the city council. The city council, at its discretion, may waive, wholly or partially, the requirements of this chapter. Any waiver of the public art requirement shall be based on a showing by the applicant that:

1.    The strict application of the law would, under the extraordinary circumstances of the particular development, produce a unique hardship not experienced by others subject to the provisions of this chapter; and

2.    The waiver or modification of the requirements is consistent with the objectives of this chapter. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.090 Establishment of the public art and mural fund.
The city council authorizes the establishment of a public art and mural fund for the deposit of all fees paid under this chapter.

This fund uses one percent of the building development costs for the acquisition and installation of the art and administration of the public art program, including, but not limited to, improvements, site preparation, lighting and landscaping. Such funds may be used to acquire, place, and maintain public art on public property throughout the city, and to administer the art in public places program. Public art acquired through the public arts fund shall be approved by the city council following a recommendation from the planning commission and consultation with the city art curator and affected communities.

Consideration shall be given to local artists in San Pablo or the broader San Francisco Bay area or art that reflects San Pablo history, culture, or experience. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

17.63.100 Severability.
If any sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases or portions of this chapter are for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed this and each section, subsection, phrase or clause of this title whether or not any one or more sections, subsections, phrases or clauses may be declared invalid or unconstitutional on their face or as applied. (Ord. 2017-007 § 2 (part), 2017: Ord. 2015-002 § 3 (Exh. 1)(part), 2015)

Zoning Map
APPENDIX A
Residential Design Guidelines*
*    Editor’s Note: See Section 17.32.090 for guidance on the use of these Design Guidelines.

Purpose
The Residential Design Guidelines are intended to assist designers in understanding the city’s goals and objectives for high quality residential development. The guidelines complement the mandatory site development regulations contained in Chapter 17.32 by providing illustrated examples of desirable and undesirable development.

Applicability
The design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects. The guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the city’s design review process (Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030) to encourage the highest quality of design while, at the same time, provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers. The guidelines also may be imposed as a condition of approval. In any instance of conflict between the provisions of these design guidelines and other provisions of the zoning ordinance, the other provisions of the zoning ordinance shall prevail.

The design guidelines are formatted into two general categories: single-family residential and multiple-family residential. Two-family duplex development falls under the guidelines applicable to single-family residential. Each category is further subdivided, where applicable, into neighborhood planning guidelines and architectural guidelines.

The guidelines apply to new construction, residential additions and remodeling that would significantly affect the exterior appearance of buildings, pursuant to Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030, design review.

Single-Family Neighborhood Planning
Objective. Site planning should emphasize development that fits into neighborhoods.

Problem Areas. Single-family, two-family and multi-family housing may be built on vacant lots or on combined lots in residential districts. Figure 1 shows three examples of residential layouts on a hypothetical group of six lots. The figure shows problems with each of the layouts, including paving over front yards for parking, developing accessory structures with no yard setbacks, jeopardizing the privacy of neighbors by orienting duplex units to the side yard, and orienting corner lot housing to the side street rather than the primary street—which weakens the continuity of front yards along the street. These problems should be addressed in applications for new residential development or additions, where applicable.

Second Story Side-Yard Setbacks. New single-family homes or duplexes, or additions to existing houses, may be constructed as one- or two-story buildings. To preserve open space on narrow lots, property owners may chose to develop two-story houses. However, second floors may loom over adjacent houses, and second floor side yard windows can intrude on the privacy of neighbors. Development, therefore, must be consistent with mandatory second story side yard setbacks and height limits (see Table 17.32-B and Table 17.32-C).

Figure 2, with four illustrations of two-floor, single-family houses on lots varying in width from fifty feet to twenty-five feet, shows the effects of the mandated wider second floor setbacks. These configurations help to protect the privacy of neighbors in their homes and back yards. The wider second story setbacks also help to let sunlight and air reach the ground level between the houses.

Figure 1—Infill Development in Single-Family Neighborhoods

Figure 2 — Desirable Single Family Houses on Lots of Varying Widths

A.    50-Foot Wide Parcel

B.    37-Foot Wide Parcel

C.    30-Foot Wide Parcel

D.    25-Foot Wide Parcel

Second Story Design. Because most single family housing in San Pablo is one-story in height, second story development or additions should not be so large as to overwhelm adjacent houses or be out of character with the neighborhood. Figures 3 through 13 show examples of new two-story houses and older homes with second floor additions. Some are acceptable and some are unacceptable. The acceptable examples are consistent with the height and setback standards in Table 17.32-B and Table 17.32-C.

Figure 3 — Acceptable Single-Family House on Wide Parcel

Figure 4 — Acceptable Single-Family House on Corner Parcel

Figure 5 — Unacceptable Single-Family House

Second Story Window Orientation. Second floor windows in R-1 and R-2 districts should be oriented to the front and rear, rather than to the side yard. This orientation helps protect the privacy of existing residents living adjacent to new two-story homes or second floor additions, particularly on twenty-five feet wide lots.

Figure 8 — Acceptable Second Story Addition on Single-Family Dwelling

Figure 9 — Acceptable Second Story Addition on Corner Parcel

Figure 10 — Preferable Second Story Addition on Corner Parcel

Garages. Garages should have varied setbacks and massing. Front yard setbacks are twenty feet for housing in the R-1 and R-2 districts, a distance intended to allow for driveway parking that does not intrude onto the sidewalk. A small increase in the garage setback in new houses is encouraged to visually diminish the importance of the garage to the front facade of the house. Recessing the garage will also help to emphasize windows and doorways facing the street (see Figure 11).

Figure 11 — Acceptable Two-Family (Duplex) Project

A garage at the front of a lot should have a single story mass, particularly in front of two-story massing (see Figure 12).

Figure 12 — Unacceptable Two-Family (Duplex) Project

Figure 13 — Acceptable One Story Two-Family (Duplex) Project

Where feasible, a garage or carport located at the rear of a parcel or on the rear half of the parcel is encouraged (Figure 6).

Porches and Doors. Covered or uncovered porches with front door entries are encouraged. They should have sufficient width and depth to be usable for protection from the weather and for sitting outdoors (see Chapter 17.46). Porches may intrude into the front yard setback a distance of up to six feet, which may introduce better variety of front yards along a street. Front doors should face the street, rather than face the side yard. Porches should not be enclosed in any way that could create habitable interior living space. A porch, overhead lattice structure or archway covered path shall be counted as part of allowed parcel coverage.

Secondary Residential Unit Compatibility. In addition to the standards in Section 17.60.070, Secondary residential units, the following guidelines should be applied:

•    Secondary units and building additions should match or be compatible with architectural features of the main building such as building scale, articulation, materials, color, roof angles and forms, types of doors, windows and porches.

•    Front-facing windows should align with existing windows.

•    The main door in a secondary unit should face the front yard rather than the side or rear yard unless this orientation is impractical.

Single-Family Architecture
Approach. The city encourages California mission style design, although there is no single architectural style required for single family or two-family housing. The focus is on a high quality residential environment.

Neighborhood Compatibility. New development in existing neighborhoods should incorporate distinctive architectural characteristics of surrounding development, such as consistent scale, articulation, materials, color, roof angles and forms (Figure 14), finished-floor elevation, porches, bay windows, window and door detailing, etc. as appropriate to the predominant styles in different neighborhoods.

Figure 14 — Acceptable Orientation of Residential Buildings

Craftsman Bungalow Style. Many older houses in San Pablo have features common to the craftsman bungalow style, including gable-end roofs or hip roofs with shallow pitches and wide eaves. Often, gable end eaves are “nested” with roofs at the same angle (see examples of the four street elevation drawings in Figure 2). Typically, such homes have horizontal wood clapboard or stucco walls and composition shingle roofs.

Early California Mission Style. Houses in the early California mission style should employ recessed windows, broad eaves for sun protection, tile roofs and stucco finishes.

Mixed Style. Newer curvilinear street subdivisions have homes with varied post-war styles. Roof forms are more complex, including mixes of gable end, hip, and shed. Mixed roof forms are discouraged. Wall surfaces may be divided into panels, such as stucco framed by rough-sawn wood. This mixed style would generally only be appropriate in hillside and large lot subdivisions in San Pablo.

Monotonous Surfaces. Long, uninterrupted exterior walls and roofs should generally be avoided. Relief from monotonous, blank walls may be achieved by the articulation of the building mass, landscaping, shadow patterns, and the varied texture of materials. Large roof areas may be improved by varied slopes, gables, hips and dormers, although different roof forms and angles should not necessarily occur on the same structure.

Exterior Materials. Exterior materials should be consistently applied, and piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided. Metal or aluminum siding and roofs, reflective materials and finishes, and unfinished concrete block are to be avoided.

Walls and Fences. Walls and fences are integral parts of house design and the streetscape. They should be designed in styles, materials and colors to complement the dwelling units that they surround and/or to which they are attached. Chapter 17.45 contains mandatory requirements for development of walls and fences for residential, commercial and industrial projects. Discretionary residential guidelines are as follows:

•    Fences and walls should be compatible with the design of buildings or structures that they surround.

•    Fences and walls should be compatible with the design of adjacent fences or walls, although walls and fence materials that are prohibited in Table 17.44-C should not be used.

•    For a multi-family project, a substantial opaque fence or wall may be developed to a height of six feet along a front property line, bordered by a public sidewalk, in order to screen private patio(s) from public view. It may be required to set such a wall back approximately three feet to accommodate an irrigated planting strip between sidewalk and wall or fence.

Multiple-Family Site Planning
Entrances. The primary vehicular and pedestrian entrance to a multiple-family housing project should evoke a positive image and provide a point of orientation. Special attention should be given to landscaping, landscaped decorative walls and paving patterns and treatments.

Parking and Drives. Chapter 17.54 defines parking requirements for typical land uses and dimensions of parking aisles and stalls. The following provides guidelines for the layout of multiple-family parking lots, garages and carports.

•    There are three ways of providing parking in multiple-family housing projects: (1) along parking drives, (2) in parking lots (or parking “courts”), and (3) in garages and carports in residential buildings. Projects are discouraged that include long, monotonous perimeter parking drives or large, undivided parking lots. Closed garages or carports are preferred, where feasible.

•    Parking drives along the perimeter of a project isolate the residential project from its surroundings, and is to be avoided.

•    Covered carports should not be combined with project perimeter walls adjacent to streets. Carport spaces in parking lots should follow the same layout principles as described for parking lots in Sections 17.54.080 and 17.34.080, commercial design guidelines.

Building Orientation. Small multiple-family projects occupying at least two adjacent lots are allowed in some zoning districts. Development may be oriented to a central parking court (see Figure 15). The rear and side portions of the units, however, should not intrude on the privacy of existing adjacent development. Dwelling units should also be oriented to the street to maintain a single-family character, where applicable.

Figure 15 — Acceptable Multiple-Family Parking Court for Four Units

Open Space. See Section 17.32.070, Open Space Requirements. Required private open space should consist of patios or decks at ground level and/or balconies at above ground floors. The design and orientation of these areas should take advantage of sunlight exposure and be sheltered from wind, noise and traffic from adjacent streets, or other incompatible uses.

•    Private open spaces should be adjacent to primary indoor living spaces.

•    Private open spaces should be screened from public view.

•    Private balconies, porches and patios within multiple-family housing should be integrated to break up large wall masses, offset floor setbacks and add human scale to structures (Figure 16).

•    Required common open space should be conveniently located for the majority of units.

Figure 16 — Acceptable Multiple-Family Housing Project

Landscaping. See Chapter 17.48, Landscaping. All areas not covered by structures, drives, parking or paving patterns and treatments should be appropriately landscaped.

•    A minimum of fifteen percent of a multi-family project shall be set aside in permanent, usable and landscaped open space.

•    Landscaping should be used to frame, soften and enhance the quality of the environment.

•    Landscaping should screen undesirable land uses and views, provide privacy and sun protection around buildings and in parking lots, and help to reduce noise.

•    Landscaping should help to break up large parking lots and separate private frontage roads in a project from public streets.

Security. Multiple-family projects should be designed to provide security for residents and visitors.

•    Parking areas should be well lighted.

•    Parking areas should be visible from residential units that use them.

•    Projects should have secure open spaces and children’s play areas that are visible from residential units.

•    Landscaping should be planted and maintained to discourage intruders from entering a project and to provide views into open space areas.

Multiple-Family Architecture
Approach. The city encourages California mission style design, although there is no particular architectural style required for multiple-family residential structures. Elements of the craftsman bungalow and early California mission style may be applicable. However, the primary focus is on creation of a high quality residential environment.

Similarity to Single-Family Architecture. Many of the same architectural principles and guidelines discussed under the single-family architecture section are also applicable to multiple-family projects, and should be considered in conjunction with the design of multiple-family projects.

Craftsman Bungalow Style. Key elements of the craftsman bungalow style, when used for multi-family residential development, should include painted, horizontal clapboard siding, gable end roofs facing the street, and roof forms that echo roof forms of adjacent or nearby bungalow style houses and multiple-family housing. This guideline does not apply to flat-roofed structures.

Early California Mission Style. Key elements of the early California mission style when used for multi-family residential development should include stucco walls, recessed windows, broad roof overhangs, and eaves supported by revealed heavy timbers. Simple building forms and roof shapes and well landscaped, walled courtyards are encouraged, while elements such as column capitals and window frames covered with stucco are discouraged.

Monotonous Facades. Long, monotonous facades exceeding approximately forty feet in length should be avoided. Building facades should be broken up to highlight individual dwelling units. This can be achieved with facade projections, recesses and staggered planes and balconies, garage doors and porch entries. Some projections from the face of a building should extend the full height of the structure. Two adjacent units should not have identical wall forms, colors and rooflines or patterns of windows and doors (see Figure 16).

Roof Treatment. Elements such as dormers and cross gables can mitigate the effects of roofs of excessive length. Secondary hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire mass of a building are much preferable to mansard roofs or segments of pitched roof applied at a structure’s edge.

Side-Yard Setbacks. Multiple-family housing is subject to the stepped side yard setbacks in Section 17.32.060. Structures greater than four stories may require additional setbacks so that they do not dominate the character of a neighborhood.

Entrances to Units. The use of long, monotonous access balconies and corridors that serve five or more units should be avoided. Instead, access points to units should be clustered in groups of four or fewer, such as through small courtyards (see Figure 17). To the extent possible, entrances to individual units should be plainly visible from nearby parking areas. Distinctive architectural elements and materials are encouraged to highlight entrances.

Stairs. Simple, bold projections of stairways should complement the architectural massing and form of multiple-family structures. Stairways should be of smooth stucco, plaster or wood, with accent trim of complementary colors. Thin looking, open treads and risers, and prefabricated stairs are strongly discouraged.

Garages and Carports. Detached garages, carports and accessory structures should be designed as integral parts of multiple-family projects. They should be similar in materials, color and detail to the principal structures of a development. Prefabricated metal carports should not be used.

Garage Doors. Garage doors should appear to be set into exterior walls rather than flush with them. The design of garage doors should be simple so as not to draw attention to them.

APPENDIX B
Commercial Design Guidelines*
*    Editor’s Note: See Section 17.34.080 for guidance on the use of these Design Guidelines.

Purpose
The Commercial Design Guidelines are intended to assist designers to understand the city’s goals and objectives for high quality commercial development. The guidelines complement the mandatory site development regulations contained in Chapter 17.34 by providing examples of desirable and undesirable commercial development.

Applicability
The design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects. The guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the city’s design review process (Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030) to encourage the highest quality of design, while at the same time provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers. The applicant should use the guidelines, unless the city determines that compliance would result in an unfair or inappropriate burden, based upon unique site and project conditions.

The guidelines apply to new construction and additions to development in the CR regional commercial, CMU commercial mixed use, and NC neighborhood commercial districts in the city. Any addition, remodeling, relocation or construction requiring a building permit within any commercial land use district shall adhere to these guidelines.

In addition to the commercial design guidelines defined herein, guidelines for commercial development in mixed-use overlay districts (Chapter 17.34) may apply.

Site Planning
Context. Site planning should emphasize development that fits into established commercial districts and neighborhoods:

•    The placement of structures, open spaces, parking and access should consider the existing built context, including the location of potentially incompatible uses, major traffic generators, significant landscape or paved elements, unique site characteristics and particular influences.

•    New structures should be sited to complement, but not necessarily mimic the design of existing nearby structures. Attention should be given to height, roof forms, orientation of windows and entrances, architectural materials and colors.

•    Open spaces should be used for specific purposes such as shady seating areas rather than simply “left over” spaces. Open spaces should not be created in areas otherwise required as land use buffers or yard setbacks. Designers should look to maintaining continuity of open space with adjacent parcels, where appropriate. Plazas should be created at prominent locations in larger commercial centers and small courtyards should be created in shopping centers and office complexes.

Pedestrian Circulation. Buildings should be clustered, where practical and appropriate, to define protected pedestrian areas and clear paths.

•    Points of pedestrian/vehicular conflict should be minimized.

•    Special paving at primary vehicular driveway entries to commercial projects should be considered to create inviting points of arrival and to highlight potential points of conflict between pedestrians and automobiles. Enhanced paving should not be located in the public right-of-way (see Figure 1).

•    Where possible, vehicular entrances on side streets should be provided to minimize conflict between vehicles and pedestrians on the primary street.

•    Arcades, landscaped trellises, special paving and other ways to create well-defined pedestrian walkways within commercial projects should be considered.

•    Boxed and tubbed plants in clay or wood containers should be considered at entrances to sidewalk stores, plazas and courtyards.

•    Enhanced paving should be used in walkways across parking lots, where appropriate, to connect commercial buildings.

Figure 1 — Special Paving at Entrances to Shopping Centers

•    Parking lots in larger commercial centers should be laid out so that pedestrians walk along drive aisles, parallel to moving cars, rather than across parking aisles and landscape areas (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 — Parking Aisles for Pedestrians

Bicycle Circulation. A bicycle network comprised of both on-street and off-street routes should be provided within the commercial districts and neighborhoods.

•    The circulation system should be designed to minimize conflicts between the bicycle and pedestrian/vehicular routes.

•    End-of-trip facilities such as bike parking spaces and racks, bicycle lockers and storage should be provided. Such facilities should be designed to allow for options and flexibility to meet the long term parking needs of employees cycling to work (Class A bicycle spaces), as well as the short term parking needs of customers/visitors cycling to services (Class B bicycle spaces).

•    There should be a minimum of one Class A bicycle space for each eight thousand square feet of gross floor area, and a minimum of six Class B bicycle spaces for any development containing a minimum of ten thousand square feet of gross floor area.

•    Class A bicycle spaces should have a minimum width of two feet and a minimum length of six feet (with a minimum access aisle used for maneuvering of three feet).

•    Class A bicycle storage spaces should include theft resistant bicycle racks (securely anchored to the floor or ground) for each bicycle space.

•    Class B bicycle spaces should be provided in racks with a minimum width of one foot and a minimum length of six feet (with a minimum aisle width of four feet separate from pedestrian access) for each bicycle.

•    Bicycle racks should have secure theft-resistant anchoring that prevents the rack from being dislodged, unless by the use of extreme force or custom design tool to dislodge. Methods that incorporate recessed bolt heads and/or grouted-in anchoring are appropriate.

•    Racks should be set back a minimum of one and one-half feet from walls, planters, etc. to provide clearance for access.

•    Racks should be provided in convenient, well-lit locations that provide visual surveillance by occupants of the building the racks are intended to serve. If the racks are not readily visible to visitors to a site, directional signage to the racks should be provided.

Vehicular Circulation. Parking and circulation layouts should consider possible conflicts between shopping center circulation and adjacent street traffic, possible conflicts at service vehicle zones, and the importance of clear, attractive parking areas for public safety:

•    Driveways entering street corner commercial businesses should be located as far as possible from street intersections so that adequate stacking room for entering autos is provided.

•    Sixty-degree angled parking in commercial businesses is generally preferable to ninety-degree parking because drivers backing out of ninety-degree spaces may turn in two directions of a through aisle. Also, angled parking space lots are often better where re-circulation is necessary for drivers to find vacant spaces. However, more ninety-degree spaces can be accommodated than angled spaces in most parking lot layouts.

•    Common driveways that provide vehicular access to more than one site are encouraged. Typically, a shared driveway bisects a common property line.

•    Shared parking between adjacent businesses is encouraged. An increase in floor area may be allowed where shared parking is demonstrated to be feasible by a study, caused to be prepared by the applicant (see Section 17.54.040(C), Shared Parking).

•    Truck delivery and loading areas in larger commercial projects should be located at the rear of commercial buildings and screened from view with landscaped berms and/or durable concrete walls.

Trees and Parking. Trees should be located in and on the perimeter of parking lots.

•    Parking for large projects should be located in connected smaller lots and separated by landscaping to reduce the visual impact of parking.

•    Landscaping areas shall be designed to serve as runoff infiltration areas and shall incorporate vegetated swales to convey storm water runoff to the stormdrain system, where appropriate.

•    Trees should be planted where they will help to delineate parking aisles and the edges of parking lots.

•    To create a tree canopy that will shade cars, trees should be planted no farther apart than four stalls, or about forty feet (see Figure 3).

•    Dense and durable plant materials in parking lots should be protected from vehicular movement by tire blocks in parking stalls, raised curbs and planting levels. Asphalt curbs are strongly discouraged because they break down much more rapidly than concrete curbs.

Figure 3 — Tree Spacing in Parking Lots

•    Trees may be placed in six-foot by six-foot planters at the head of parking stalls. When the planters are bordered with concrete curbs and turned in a diamond configuration, they will effectively serve as tire stops and will avoid the loss of parking spaces (see Figure 3).

•    Varieties of parking lot trees should be specified that lend themselves to trimming about ten feet above ground, and which do not drop fruit or sap that could damage automobile surfaces (see list of city-approved trees).

Walls and Fences. Walls and fences are integral parts of commercial project design and the streetscape. They should be designed in styles, materials and colors to complement the commercial buildings that they surround and/or to which they are attached. Chapter 17.45 contains mandatory requirements for development of walls and fences for commercial, industrial and residential projects. Discretionary guidelines are as follows:

•    Fences and walls should be compatible with the design of buildings or structures that they surround.

•    A consistent design style for a fence or wall should be used around a property.

•    Fences and walls should be compatible with the design of adjacent fences or walls, although walls and fence materials that are prohibited in Chapter 17.45 shall not be used.

•    Screening of a proposed commercial project from adjacent residential properties shall require a six-feet high masonry wall in the side yard and rear yard (see Section 17.45.040(C)(1)). The wall should be finished both sides with plaster or stucco, with landscaping planted adjacent to the wall on the project site. The landscape strip adjacent to the wall shall be not less than three feet in width and be irrigated with an automatic irrigation system.

•    Depending upon its length, a wall may be uniform in its height and/or surface treatment. However, a long, visible wall could be segmented with columns, offset wall planes, or planting pockets (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 — Wall Types

•    Vines and climbing plants, such as bougainvillea, wisteria and grape ivy should be planted adjacent to blank building walls on trellises and adjacent to perimeter walls or fences.

•    Low walls and/or fences such as a three-foot high solid wall or fence, or a transparent fence should be used with dense landscaping, to screen parking lots from the street. The planting areas adjacent to sidewalks should be no less than three feet wide and no more than three feet high (see Figure 5). Shrubs should be maintained to the same height of approximately three feet, to maintain adequate visibility from automobiles. Landscaping on berms can be used to elevate the effective height of the screen and present an attractive exposure of a project to the public sidewalk and street (see Figure 5).

Figure 5 — Screening of Parking Behind Sidewalks

•    Screening of commercial and industrial operations, utilities equipment and outdoor storage is discussed in Section 17.45.080.

•    Exterior storage should be confined to portions of a site least visible from public view.

•    Any outdoor equipment, whether on a roof or on the ground, shall be appropriately screened from view. The method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the primary structure in terms of material, color, shape and size.

•    Wall screening for outdoor storage in commercial and industrial projects should be six feet in height. A wall up to eight feet in height may be required, depending upon the items being stored and the visibility of the equipment and the wall from public areas.

•    Dumpsters should be stored within a concrete or concrete block wall enclosure, with a durable metal or heavy timber gate. Such enclosures should be located for the convenience of employees and where truck maneuvering will not disrupt vehicular movements. See Section 17.58.020 Refuse Disposal and Recycling for dimensional requirements.

•    Screening of loading areas is shown in Section 17.34.120 Industrial Design Guidelines.

Preferred Site Planning for Small Commercial Infill Projects
Portions of the principal roadways in San Pablo are bordered by small businesses on narrow lots. In some cases, storefronts may border the sidewalk with parking behind. In other cases, stores are located at the rear of parcels with parking in front, adjacent to the sidewalk. Street-front stores and businesses with parking at the rear of a parcel are strongly preferred because such layouts foster pedestrian shopping along the sidewalk and minimize the exposure of parking lots to the street. Not all properties lend themselves to this configuration, but they may be consolidated with adjacent parcels to allow driveway access to parking in the rear. Development on larger consolidated parcels, and development on corner lots with access to parking from the side street are most feasible. Examples of preferred, acceptable, and discouraged examples of commercial development on paired-parcels are illustrated below.

Preferable Commercial Building at Front of Parcel (See Figure 6). Commercial infill projects should be designed to strengthen the continuity of the building street-front and to minimize exposure of required off-street parking at the front of the parcel. Attention should be given to screening the parking from any adjacent residential development.

Figure 6 — Preferred Commercial Building at Front of Parcel—Parking at Rear of Parcel

Acceptable Commercial Building at Front and Side of Parcel (See Figure 7). Commercial infill projects with stores oriented to the front and side of the parcel, where parking is partially screened from the street, may be acceptable.

Figure 7 — Acceptable Commercial Project at Front/Side of Parcel—Parking at Rear and Side of Parcel

Discouraged Commercial Building at Rear of Parcel. (See Figure 8). Commercial infill projects that locate parking at the front of the parcel with buildings behind the parking should screen parking with low landscaped walls and possible berms. However, parking at the front of lots is strongly discouraged.

Figure 8 — Discouraged Commercial at Rear of Parcel, Parking at Front of Parcel

Architectural Guidelines for Commercial Buildings—Commercial Districts

Commercial development that is subject to the design review process defined in Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030 will be evaluated against the guidelines contained in this section.

Commercial Storefront Design. There is no particular architectural style required for projects in the commercial districts. The focus of design is for commercial storefront development adjacent to the sidewalk. Second story development is also allowed and encouraged. Corner buildings may have a roof or building mass that is greater than adjacent buildings. Infill commercial development should promote lively, pedestrian-oriented business districts (see Figure 9).

Figure 9 — Storefronts

•    Storefronts with display windows sheltered by awnings or canopies are intended to stimulate window-shopping. Window and doorframes should be made of substantial materials such as solid wood or steel, but not narrow aluminum frames.

•    The required dimensions of awnings and fixed canopies used for signs are shown in Section 18.04.090(C)(8). The use of awnings or fixed canopies along a row of contiguous structures should be restricted to covered walkways of the same form, color, fabrication, and mounting location.

•    Plexiglas, metal and glossy vinyl illuminated awnings are prohibited.

•    Infill commercial storefronts should include display windows mounted over an eighteen-inch to twenty-four-inch high bulkhead, a recessed doorway in the middle of the storefront, and a fixed canopy or canvas awning mounted at the top of the display windows. An awning may be in a fixed or retractable frame (see Figure 9).

•    Designers should consider a variety of materials for storefronts, such as tile bulkheads, multi-paned windows, and stucco walls, as long as they are durable. Materials used on the second and succeeding floors of a building should be carried through from the materials used at the ground floor. Upper floors may include residential unit(s) and/or commercial space (see Section 17.34.110 Mixed-Use Design Guidelines).

•    Second and succeeding floors for residences or offices may be required to be set back from the front yard property line in order to provide a balcony and reduced exposure to street noise.

•    Fixed or sliding security grilles may be used for doors and windows where permitted by applicable building and fire code regulations. However, grilles shall be located on the interior side of the openings only.

•    Corporate franchise imagery, such as that used for national franchise businesses, is strongly discouraged unless building forms, materials, signs, logos, colors and other identifying features are made compatible with the overall design character of the area.

Architectural Guidelines for Commercial Buildings—NC, CR and CMU Districts

Architectural Styles. There is no particular architectural style required for commercial buildings in the CR regional commercial and CMU commercial mixed use districts. However, designers are encouraged to consider the early California mission style, as best represented by the design of San Pablo city hall. Regardless of the architectural style chosen, commercial buildings should be designed to fit into their surroundings, but not necessarily mimic, the design of nearby buildings.

Articulation of Large Commercial Buildings. Large windowless buildings that give the impression of “box-like” commercial warehouse structures are generally unattractive and detract from the overall scale of most buildings. The following ways to reduce the appearance of large-scale, bulky structures, particularly on the ground floor, should be considered.

•    Exterior wall planes should vary in depth and/or direction; Wall planes should not exceed fifty feet in length without a vertical offset.

•    Blank walls should be made more interesting with windows, trellises, pedestrian arcades or awnings or canopies, rich exterior materials and colors, eaves and moldings, and other architectural features.

•    Roof height should vary up to the maximum allowed height.

•    A height increase of up to fifteen feet above the allowed height may be allowed for architectural features, such as a building entry or prominent corner building, covering up to twenty percent of the building footprint.

•    Landscaping and architectural detailing, particularly around building entrances, should be used to lessen the impact of otherwise bulky buildings.

Building Wall Surface Treatments. The different parts of a building’s facade should be articulated by arrangement of facade elements and/or a change in materials and color.

•    Rich, saturated colors are encouraged, while a uniform treatment of off-white is discouraged.

•    Darker colored wall treatments on the lower portions of a facade should be considered to establish a base for a building (perhaps three feet to four feet in height).

•    Stucco wall treatments are encouraged because stucco can be used in a sculptural manner, such as a curved parapet or a linear parapet molding. While large expanses of blank stucco are discouraged, stucco walls can be divided into scaled panels by inscribed grooves (“reveals”). Stucco is also the most appropriate material for design in the early California mission style, which should be considered for commercial, multi-family residential, and public/semi-public uses in the city.

Lighting. Lighting should provide illumination for security and safety, while avoiding light intrusion into off-site areas.

•    Parking, loading, shipping and receiving, walkways, entrances and working areas should be illuminated.

•    Light fixtures should be architecturally compatible with the project design.

•    Lighting should be adequate for security, particularly at entrances, but not overly bright.

•    All lighting fixtures shall be shielded to confine light spread to project boundaries.

Architectural Guidelines for Multi-Family Infill—NC District

Where long-term demand for housing exceeds demand for commercial space in commercial districts, the city will consider proposals for infill multiple-family development in the commercial districts.

Multiple-family development in the NC district is allowed by conditional use permit, pursuant to Table 17.34-A. Eligible multiple-family projects include R-3 and R-4 projects developed pursuant to standards defined in Section 17.34.050.

Two examples of acceptable urban infill housing in the NC district are discussed and illustrated below. Infill is encouraged where it would be closely oriented to the sidewalk and would serve to maintain the continuity of existing or future commercial storefronts on one or both sides of the housing. This type of residential development may not be suited to all NC neighborhood commercial districts.

Courtyard Apartments. To be successful, residential development must be protected from adjacent, incompatible commercial development and street activity and noise. An example of an inward-oriented courtyard housing project is shown in Figure 10 (see also Residential Design Guidelines, Figure 15 Acceptable Multiple-Family Parking Court for Four Units, which may also provide guidance for infill residential development in commercial districts).

Figure 10 — Courtyard Apartments in Commercial Districts

Discretionary guidelines are as follows:

•    The privacy and security of occupants should be protected by a clear transition from public sidewalk to semi-private entrances and private indoor space. Windows that look down on the courtyard, as shown in Figure 10, discourage unwanted visitors. In this figure, a narrow planter box separates the sidewalk from a well-illuminated pedestrian entry. Residents may also enter their homes directly from their garages. There are no exterior stairwells.

•    Units that face the street front should have windows that impart a residential scale, consistent with other appropriate nearby development.

•    Multiple-family housing in commercial districts should be consistent with the design of multiple-family housing in residential districts; however, private and common open space may not be feasible, except for small balconies. In such cases, driveway/courtyards should be designed as attractive usable open space, perhaps bordered by planters and paved with decorative tiles (designed to withstand the weight of moving vans).

•    Flow-through ventilation may be inhibited because the rear of units in Figure 10 abut the side property line with a blank wall, anticipating future adjacent development of commercial or residential projects. Therefore, the two units in the middle of the project on each side of the court have only one facade exposed to light and ventilation. In this case, operable skylights for these units may be appropriate.

Streetfront Apartments. Infill lots in commercial districts may be appropriate for streetfront apartments. In contrast to the inward-oriented apartment project shown in Figure 10, the streetfront apartment project shown in Figure 11 may be appropriate for locations where street traffic is not great.

Figure 11 — Streetfront Apartments in Commercial Districts

Discretionary guidelines are discussed below and illustrated in Figure 11 above.

•    Ground floor apartments may be oriented to the street if front doors are separated from the sidewalk by such measures as lockable gates, a narrow landscaping strip of dense shrubs, and an elevation change from the sidewalk to the front door, as shown in Figure 11.

•    To enhance security for residents, entrance porches should be well illuminated and visible to passers-by.

•    Each apartment should have its own entry.

•    Buildings should be articulated to emphasize the single-unit apartment. Variations in setback, balconies and rooflines will help to avoid the anonymity of typical apartment blocks.

APPENDIX C
Industrial Design Guidelines*
*    Editor’s Note: See Section 17.34.120 for guidance on the use of these Design Guidelines.

Purpose
The Industrial Design Guidelines are intended to assist designers to understand the city’s goals and objectives for high quality industrial development. The guidelines complement the mandatory site development regulations contained in Chapter 17.34 by providing examples of desirable and undesirable industrial development.

Applicability
The design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects. The guidelines are to be used during the city’s design review process (Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030) to encourage the highest quality of design while, at the same time, provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers. The guidelines also may be imposed as a condition of approval. In any instance of conflict between the provisions of these design guidelines and other provisions of the zoning ordinance, the other provisions of the zoning ordinance shall prevail.

The guidelines apply to new construction and additions to existing development in the M industrial district in the city. Any addition, remodeling, relocation or construction requiring a building permit within this industrial land use district shall adhere to these guidelines, where applicable.

Site Planning
Context. Site planning should emphasize controlled site access and clear on-site circulation; service areas located at the sides and rear of buildings; screening of outdoor storage, work areas and equipment; clear building entries; and landscaping and open space. The placement of structures, open spaces, parking and access drives should consider the existing built context, including the location of potentially incompatible uses, major traffic generators, significant landscape or paved elements, unique site characteristics and particular influences.

Industrial Parks. For larger sites, comprehensively planned industrial parks should be developed, with grouped buildings and parking.

Varied Setbacks. Although no building setbacks are required in the M industrial district, building setbacks should be in proportion to the scale of the structure and in consideration of existing development adjacent to it. Larger structures may require a greater setback to achieve a proper balance of buildings to landscaped open space, and to protect adjacent properties from disturbance.

Site Planning Examples
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show examples of hypothetical industrial development projects on a typical parcel. The illustrations incorporate guidelines discussed in this section.

Acceptable Industry Layout. Figure 1 shows a development plan for a single manufacturing business. The building is set back from the street, behind visitor parking. Employee parking is on the side. Loading is at the rear. A three-foot wide planting strip borders the site. The building is set off with landscaping around its perimeter, and exterior walls are offset to break down the scale of the building. The site plan is acceptable, except for the undesirable parking at the front of the site.

Discouraged Industry Layout. Figure 2 shows a development plan for a single manufacturing business. The building is set back from the street, behind the loading area, and parking is oriented to the side. A three-foot wide planting strip borders a six-foot high fence/wall around one side and the rear of the site. The building is set off with landscaping along one side only. Exterior walls are articulated to break down the scale of the building. The main entry is made prominent. The site plan is discouraged because it places loading at the front of the parcel.

Preferred Business Layout. Figure 3 shows a development plan for three businesses such as fabrication, contracting and distribution. The front of the building is set back from the sidewalk to allow for landscaping. The front entry and side entries are articulated. Landscaping is located adjacent to the building, between the entries. Each business has direct access to paved areas at the rear and non-entry side of the building. One of the driveways is shared with an adjacent property.

Figure 1 — Acceptable Industry Layout

Figure 2 — Discouraged Industry Layout

Figure 3 — Preferred Business Layout

Parking and Circulation
Parking and circulation layouts should consider possible conflicts between project circulation and adjacent street traffic, possible conflicts at loading zones, and the importance of clear, attractive parking areas for public safety.

Visibility of Parked Cars. Parking lots and parked cars should not be the dominant visual elements of an industrial site, as it appears to be for Figure 2. Large, expansive paved areas located between the street and buildings are to be avoided in favor of smaller, multiple lots separated by landscaping and buildings. Visitor parking at the front of an industrial site is not desirable and should be screened from view.

Walking within Parking Lots. Parking lots should be designed so that pedestrians walk along drive aisles, parallel to moving cars, rather than cross parking aisles and landscaping areas (see illustration in Section 17.34.080, Commercial Design Guidelines).

Angled Parking. Angled parking is encouraged for larger parking lots that can accommodate one-way aisles. Figure 1 could operate with a one-way loop with angled parking.

Car/Pedestrian Conflict. Circulation routes should be designed to avoid potential conflicts with pedestrians.

Shared Driveways. Common driveways that provide vehicular access to more than one site are encouraged. Typically, a shared driveway bisects a common property line, as shown in Figure 3.

Internal Vehicular Circulation. Vehicles should not be required to enter the street in order to move from one building to another on the same site, as possible in the Figure 1 layout.

Loading Facilities
Loading at Rear. To avoid views of often unsightly and noisy loading operations, loading for industrial uses should not be located at the front of buildings where it is difficult to adequately screen them from view. Such facilities are more appropriate at the rear or the side where special screening may not be required (see Figure 1).

Loading at Front. Where it is not possible to locate loading facilities behind the building, the loading area must be screened from the street (see Figure 2).

Landscaping and Screening
Where industrial uses are adjacent to non-industrial uses or parking, appropriate buffering techniques such as setbacks, screening, and landscaping should be provided to mitigate impacts of industrial operations. See also Trees and Parking, Commercial Design Guidelines applicable to industrial development.

Perimeter Screening. Screening of a proposed industrial project from existing neighbors may require a six-foot high masonry wall or durable wooden fence on the side yard property line and the rear yard property line. A height (up to eight feet) should be determined by the height of the material or industrial activity that requires screening.

•    A masonry wall should be finished on both sides with plaster or stucco, with landscaping planted adjacent to the wall on the project site.

•    The landscape strip adjacent to the wall shall be not less than three feet in width (see Figures 1, 2 and 3) and must be irrigated with an automatic irrigation system. The landscaping should be protected by tire blocks.

•    Depending upon its length, a wall may be uniform in its height and/or surface treatment. However, a long, visible wall could be segmented with columns or pilasters, offset wall planes, or planting pockets (Figure 4, Commercial Design Guidelines).

Screening of Industry and Storage. Equipment and outdoor storage should be screened, where it is visible from public view.

•    Screening should use the most appropriate materials, including solid wood fencing, masonry walls and landscaping. Merchandise shall not be displayed, sold, or stored outside, with the exception of exterior construction materials, public utilities equipment, and similar materials, pursuant to a use permit.

•    Any outdoor equipment, whether on a roof or on the ground, shall be appropriately screened from view. The method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the primary structure in terms of material, color, shape and size.

•    Wall or fence screening for outdoor storage should be six feet in height. A wall up to eight feet in height may be acceptable, depending upon the items being stored and the visibility of the equipment and the wall from public areas.

•    Exterior storage should be confined to portions of a site least visible from public view.

Parking Adjacent to Sidewalk. Parking lots adjacent to, and visible from public streets are discouraged. They must be adequately screened from view by a low wall or hedge, berms, changes in elevation and landscaping, or combinations of these elements, where appropriate (see Figure 1).

•    Low walls and/or fences should be used with landscaping to screen parking lots from the street. The planting areas adjacent to sidewalks should be no less than three feet wide and no more than three feet high (see Figure 5, Screening of Parking Behind Sidewalks, Commercial Design Guidelines). Shrubs should be trimmed to a height of approximately three feet to maintain adequate visibility from automobiles.

•    Landscaping on berms can be used to elevate the effective height of the screening and present an attractive exposure of a project to the public sidewalk and street. See Section 17.45.030 for discussion of walls and fences applicable to commercial and other projects.

Landscaping “Islands.” Bare ground is discouraged and should be paved or landscaped. Structures should be located on landscaped “islands,” where the office portion of a building does not directly abut paved parking areas; a minimum five to ten-foot landscape strip should be provided between parking areas and the office portion of the structure. Landscaping is recommended around the base of buildings to soften the edge between the parking lot and the structure, as appropriate to the type of industry proposed (see Figure 1).

Buildings Adjacent to Streets. Long, windowless industrial buildings paralleling Rumrill Blvd. and Giant Road should be avoided. Industrial buildings should be oriented perpendicular to these major streets, allowing for a pedestrian entry at the front of the building to the sidewalk (see Figure 3).

Screening of Loading Areas. Landscaped berms should be considered to screen loading docks and dumpsters from public areas (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 — Elevation Changes to Screen Loading and Other Operations

Architectural Design Guidelines
Industrial development that is subject to the design review process defined in Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030 will be evaluated against the guidelines contained in this section.

There is no particular architectural style required for industrial projects. The focus of design should be on building entrances, durable and attractive exterior materials, and avoidance of long, uninterrupted blank walls.

Large Buildings. Large buildings that give the impression of “box-like” structures are generally unattractive and detract from the overall design of most buildings. The following ways should be considered to reduce the appearance of large scale, bulky structures, particularly on the ground floor.

•    Roof height should vary up to the maximum allowed height.

•    A height increase of up to fifteen feet above the allowed height shall be allowed for architectural features, particularly building entrances, covering up to 20% of the building footprint (see Figure 2).

•    Exterior wall planes should vary in depth and/or direction. Wall planes should not exceed fifty feet in length without a vertical offset. Rooflines should not maintain the same height for more than fifty feet without offsetting the roofline or interrupting it (see Figure 1).

•    The upper portion of an exterior wall should end with a capped parapet, molding or roof eave. Mansard roofs and mansard roof eaves are strongly discouraged.

•    Blank front and side wall elevations on street frontages should be avoided.

•    Blank walls should be made more interesting with windows, textured or incised wall materials and bands of varying color and materials. Stucco wall treatments are encouraged because stucco can be used in a sculptural manner, such as a curved parapet or a linear parapet molding. Stucco walls can be divided into scaled panels by inscribed grooves (“reveals”).

•    Windows and doors flush to the exterior wall of the building are discouraged, unless awnings or canopies over the windows are used.

Entrance Projections. Trellises with vine landscaping, window awnings or canopies, and other architectural projections should be considered at entrances, depending upon the nature of the proposed industry.

Lighting
Lighting should provide illumination for security and safety, while avoiding light intrusion into off-site areas.

•    Parking, loading, shipping and receiving, walkways, entrances and working areas should be illuminated.

•    Light fixtures should be architecturally compatible with the project design.

•    Lighting should be adequate for security, particularly at entrances, but not overly bright.

•    All lighting fixtures shall be shielded to confine light spread to project boundaries.

•    No mercury vapor lights are allowed—use metal halide or low-pressure sodium, or equal, only.

•    Light shall be directed toward the ground and not toward the sky.

APPENDIX D
Mixed-Use Design Guidelines*
*    Editor’s Note: See Section 17.34.110 for guidance on the use of these Design Guidelines.

Purpose
The Mixed-Use Design Guidelines are intended to assist designers to understand the city’s goals and objectives for high quality development within the CMU commercial mixed use district. The guidelines complement the mandatory provisions contained in Chapter 17.34 by providing examples of desirable and undesirable mixed-use development.

Applicability
The design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects. The guidelines are to be used during the city’s design review process (Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030) to encourage the highest quality of design, while at the same time provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers. The guidelines also may be imposed as a condition of approval. In any instance of conflict between the provisions of these design guidelines and other provisions of the zoning ordinance, the other provisions of the zoning ordinance shall prevail.

The guidelines apply to new construction and additions to existing development in areas subject to the CMU commercial mixed use district. Any addition, remodeling, relocation or construction requiring a building permit within these areas shall adhere to these guidelines, where applicable.

In addition to the mixed use design guidelines defined herein, the residential design guidelines (see Section 17.32.090) commercial design guidelines (see Section 17.34.080) and/or industrial design guidelines (see Section 17.34.120) may be appropriate for development in the mixed-use overlay districts.

General
Buildings containing commercial stores and multi-family residential units, and/or office space are encouraged where public transportation is convenient, particularly in the El Portal district, 23rd Street district, Market Avenue district, and the Alvarado district. Mixed-used buildings typically include ground floor storefronts, second floor office space and/or residential units, and residential units on succeeding floors. Parking for stores may be located in front of a building, with parking for residences and offices behind the building. Shared parking can also be located below the building (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 — Example Mixed-Use Commercial/Residential Project

Mixed-Use Districts
The following design guidelines are broadly consistent with goals, policies and actions of the General Plan. Public amenities and design features are intended to stimulate and support such land uses as employment, entertainment, public institutions and transit stations in appropriate districts.

Gateway District. In the entertainment area, design features that are integral to new development projects such as the following are encouraged:

•    Pedestrian walkways, including paseos and covered walkways;

•    Outdoor gathering places, including cafes and plazas; and

•    Lighting, landscaping, banners and signs, and specially designed paving patterns to establish an entertainment design theme.

El Portal Public Transit District. To create a pedestrian-friendly downtown, the following design features are encouraged:

•    A central plaza for outdoor festivals, activities and markets;

•    A pedestrian crossing of San Pablo Creek to connect neighborhoods to the south with Helms School and the International Marketplace Shopping Center, to the north of the creek;

•    Signs along San Pablo Avenue to replace non-conforming signs;

•    Use of awnings and canopies along sidewalks to encourage window-shopping in storefronts;

•    Street trees and a canopy of parking lot shade trees to delineate parking aisles and create a more attractive, pedestrian-friendly downtown; and

•    A design theme at the intersection of El Portal Drive and Church Lane to signal this gateway to downtown.

•    A range of housing from high-density single family, to high density multifamily;

•    Housing organized around well-defined internal pedestrian and open space networks, with pedestrian connections to adjacent uses in the district;

•    Avoidance of gated communities, in preference to less obtrusive measures to provide security and privacy; and

•    Variety in housing types, forms, colors, materials, building heights and other features to highlight the individual dwelling units.

23rd Street District. To strengthen the commercial district, the following design features are encouraged:

•    Storefronts with display windows and awnings located at the back of sidewalk. Awnings may extend over pedestrian sidewalks, pursuant to sign controls in Section 18.04.090(C)(8);

•    Continuation of the colorful, expressive design theme of the neighborhood, including unusual signs and building colors and materials in new construction and additions to buildings in the district;

•    Incorporation of existing decorative masonry columns that are located at intervals along the back of sidewalks into development layouts that include driveways and building entrances; and

•    Landscaping within, and adjacent to, off-street parking lots and driveways leading to parking and along landscaped, masonry walls adjacent to residential land uses (see Section 17.34.080, Commercial Design Guidelines).

Market Avenue District. Measures to maintain the low-scaled pedestrian character of the district include the following:

•    Public improvements to transit stops, sidewalks, street trees and pedestrian-scaled lighting designed to foster pedestrian circulation.

Rumrill Boulevard District. The following features are intended to allow potentially incompatible land uses to be developed adjacent to each other, and to allow new development that reflects the diversity of the area:

•    Buffers between commercial/industrial uses and residential properties;

•    Development allowing varied architectural design solutions that reflect the diversity of the district; and

•    Commercial uses on the east side of Rumrill Boulevard that include adequate off-street parking through lot consolidation and development up to 0.7 FAR.

Alvarado District. The following design features are encouraged to reflect the district’s historic importance as San Pablo’s original town center:

•    New buildings organized around pedestrian amenities including plazas, fountains, covered walkways, balconies, paseos, courtyards and parks;

•    Development which incorporates a variety of seating, accent lighting, integration of public and private areas, a variety of paving and tile materials, etc.; and

•    Commercial buildings designed in the early California mission style, and other historic styles in the city, particularly along San Pablo Avenue and Church Lane near their intersection.

Giant Trade Center Business Park District. The following design features encourage new industrial development that will not be disruptive to nearby housing:

•    A landscaped masonry wall built to a height of between six and eight feet along the east property line of the Giant Trade Center to help protect existing adjacent residential uses from industrial activities.

•    Commercial/light industrial development that is fully contained within industrial buildings to minimize visible or auditory impact to the adjacent neighborhood.

Hillside Area District. The following design features are intended to manage hillside open space and help to maintain the rural character of the hillside:

•    Clustered residential development to retain trees, open space, and views; and

•    Pedestrian open space connection between hillside housing and shopping centers along the south side of San Pablo Dam Road, which may foster development of a pedestrian-accessible neighborhood commercial center.

APPENDIX E
Sign Design Guidelines
Purpose
The Sign Design Guidelines are intended to assist designers to understand the city’s goals and objectives for high quality development. The guidelines complement the mandatory sign regulations contained in Title 18, Signs, by providing examples of desirable and undesirable signs.

Applicability
The design guidelines and illustrations are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects. The guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the city’s design review process (Sections 17.18.090 and 17.20.030) to encourage the highest quality of design while, at the same time, provide the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity by project designers. The guidelines also may be imposed as a condition of approval. In any instance of conflict between the provisions of these design guidelines and other provisions of the zoning ordinance, the other provisions of the zoning ordinance shall prevail.

The guidelines apply to signs for new multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, mixed-use and institutional development. Any addition, remodeling, relocation or construction requiring a building permit within the affected land use district shall adhere to these guidelines, where applicable.

Adjustment to Sign Area
Maximum sign areas for various types of signs are summarized in Chapter 18.04. Within the limits of the maximum sign area, adjustments should be made to improve the readability of wall signs, without using unnecessarily large letters. Typically, words with letters from ten inches to twenty-four inches in height will be readily readable as seen from perimeter sidewalks and from vehicles being driven at moderate speed (e.g., twenty-five mph to thirty mph) on adjacent roadways. At some locations, six inch high letters will be satisfactory. The choice of appropriate signs should consider the heights of lettering, the locations and sizes of existing signs on adjacent businesses, the height of building walls to which signs are mounted, architectural designs of buildings, colors, and other factors described in Title 18, Signs.

Discouraged Signs
Business Center Sign Directories. Freestanding project identification signs located near vehicular entrances to shopping centers are discouraged if they include directories of tenants. Frequently, such signs include multiple tenant names and corporate logos that can be difficult to decipher from a moving vehicle on an adjacent roadway (see Figure 1). It is preferable to have a pylon-mounted sign or monument sign with the name of the shopping or business center alone, and the names of tenants mounted on the walls of the businesses they represent. Further, very large signs and billboards, as shown in Figure 1, are strongly discouraged.

Figure 1 — Unacceptable Business Center Tenant Signs

Proliferation of Signs on One Property. Even though a property may comply with the maximum overall sign area allowed by Section 18.04.090, multiple small signs and logos are discouraged, and roof signs are prohibited (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 — Unacceptable Multiple Signs and Roof Signs

Signboards. Framed signboards or internally illuminated box signs (also known as cabinet signs) that are mounted on the front walls of businesses are prohibited. Signs comprised of individually mounted letters are encouraged.

Encouraged Signs
Monument Signs. Monument signs are preferred to pylon-mounted signs for most project identification situations. A monument sign can be integrated into landscaped areas, with terrace walls and berms that screen parking, unlike freestanding pylon-mounted signs (see Figure 3).

A monument sign can also be placed alongside a driveway entrance to a project or in the median of an entrance driveway (see Figure 1 in the Commercial Design Guidelines).

Figure 3 — Acceptable Monument Signs

Street-front Signs. Street-front businesses should emphasize pedestrian-oriented signs, such as projecting signs, awning valance signs, and blade signs hung beneath covered walkways (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 — Acceptable Pedestrian-Oriented Storefront Signs

Wall Signs Aligned. Signs mounted on the front walls of businesses should be aligned with wall signs on adjacent businesses, if the businesses share the same wall plane. Wall signs should not crowd the top of wall or parapet. Planned sign programs are encouraged to ensure that signage is consistent throughout larger projects (see Figure 9 in the Commercial Design Guidelines).

Externally Illuminated Signs. Where sign lighting is desired, external illumination is preferred to internal illumination, particularly in residential areas and as long as spotlights are not directly visible or create glare that extends off-site.

A mural shall not exceed the height of the structure, shall not extend more than six inches from the building facade, shall not exceed one hundred square feet (ten feet by ten feet), shall not include electrical or moving components; shall not cover windows or doors, and shall remain unaltered for a period of at least two years.

Any such artwork or signage on an exterior wall that does not meet these qualifications shall be considered a wall sign and subject to the sign permit requirement.

“Noncommercial message” means a message which pertains primarily to debate in the marketplace of ideas. Such messages typically cover subjects such as politics, religion, philosophy, social policy, as well as commentary on sports, arts and entertainments, etc. There is no on-site/off-site distinction as to noncommercial messages.

“Off-site sign” means a sign that advertises commercial products, accommodations, services or activities not provided in or on the property or premises upon which it is located. Any sign other than an on-site sign, including all outdoor advertising and outdoor displays or display space on a lease or rental basis.

“On-site sign” means a sign that advertises the commercial business, accommodation, services or activities provided on the premises on which the sign is located, or is expected to be provided in the near future. In the case of developments subject to a master sign program, all establishments subject to the program are considered on-site whenever located within any location subject to the program. As to construction signs, “on-site” includes all parties involved in the specific construction project. Any sign located within twelve feet of a main public entrance to an establishment is also considered on-site, regardless of property lines.

“Street frontage” means the linear foot width of a building site or parcel of land along or fronting on a street or other principal thoroughfare.

“Temporary sign” means a sign which, by its physical nature, is not suitable for long-term display. Temporary signs are typically made of lightweight or flimsy material, and can be easily installed with ordinary hand tools. Any sign which is within the definition of “structure” in the building code is not within this definition. The definition also includes signs mounted on permanent structures, such as windows, walls, or fences, but which may be on display only for a limited period of time.

18.04.010 Title, authority, purpose, scope.
A.    Title. This chapter shall be known as the city of San Pablo regulatory sign ordinance.

B.    Authority. This chapter is enacted pursuant to the following provisions of state law: the California Constitution, Article XI, Section 7; Government Code Sections 38774, 38775, 65000 et seq. and 65850(b); Business and Professions Code Sections 5200 et seq. and 5490 et seq.; Civil Code Section 713; Penal Code Section 556 et seq.; and the city’s inherent police and zoning powers.

C.    Purpose. This chapter sets forth a comprehensive system for the regulation of signs which are within the corporate limits of the city. This chapter governs the number, size, type, location, and physical aspects of signs. By adopting this chapter, the city council intends to serve and advance various public and governmental interests, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.    To protect the right to free speech by the display of protected message(s) on a sign, while balancing this right against public interests; to balance the community interests against the free expression rights protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and corollary provisions of the California Constitution; to regulate signs in a manner consistent with the U.S. and California Constitutions, which are content neutral as to noncommercial speech and which do not favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech; and to provide for all persons, businesses, establishments and institutions adequate opportunity to express their message to the public by way of display of images on signs, in a manner that is consistent with community interests;

2.    To implement the sign-related goals, strategies and policies of the General Plan;

3.    To reduce hazards that may be caused or worsened by driver and pedestrian distraction caused by signs, especially those projecting over public rights-of-way or near roadway intersections or interfere with ingress and egress;

4.    To preserve and enhance the aesthetic and environmental values of the community, while at the same time providing adequate channels of communication to the public;

5.    To reduce excessive and confusing sign displays;

6.    To preserve and improve the appearance of the city as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade;

7.    To safeguard and improve property values;

8.    To reduce “visual shouting matches,” visual clutter and pollution by setting reasonable time, place and manner limits on sign displays, which apply equally to all persons who are similarly situated;

9.    To protect the peaceful, quiet, residential nature of neighborhoods from intrusion or degradation by inappropriate commercial signage, to protect and enhance property values, and to encourage clean economic activity through the regulation of such elements as size, number, location, design and illumination of signs;

10.    To protect public and private investment in buildings and open spaces;

11.    To state and enforce city policies regarding new billboards;

12.    To promote the public health, safety and general welfare; and

13.    To ensure that commercial signs are accessory or auxiliary to a principal business or establishment on or near the same premises, rather than functioning as general advertising (advertising for hire).

D.    Scope. This chapter regulates signs which are within the legal corporate limits of the city, but not on city property or in the public right-of-way. Such signs on city property, public right-of-way, and private property leased or contracted to city for signage purposes are controlled by Chapter 18.06. Signs on property that is owned by public entities other than the city and its affiliated agencies, and over which the city exercises land use regulatory authority, are regulated by this chapter. If the city council creates any zoning overlay or approves a use permit, any sign rules in such overlay zoning district or use permit will prevail over contrary or conflicting provisions of this chapter. This chapter is regulatory; it does not abrogate, override, limit, modify or nullify any easements, covenants, leases or other existing private agreements that are more restrictive than this chapter. This chapter does not modify state or federal laws pertaining to the regulation or display of signs.

E.    Interpretation. This chapter is to be interpreted so that the result is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan and the requirements of the First Amendment. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

18.04.020 General provisions.
A.    Compliance Required. Signs may be erected, installed or displayed only in compliance with this chapter. Unless explicitly exempted from the sign permit requirement, it is unlawful for any sign to be displayed without first obtaining a sign permit for a sign or planned sign program, subject to design review approval, and a building permit if required. A sign that is exempt from the sign permit requirement may still be subject to other requirements and restrictions set forth herein, and other permit and legal approvals, including those required by governmental or regulatory agencies other than the city.

B.    Responsibility for Compliance. The responsibility for compliance with this chapter rests jointly and severally upon the sign owner, the sign operator (if different from the sign owner), all parties holding the present right of possession and control of the property on which a sign is located, mounted or installed, and the legal owner of the lot or parcel, even if the sign was mounted, installed, erected or displayed without the consent of the owner and/or other parties holding the legal right to immediate possession and control.

C.    Violations. When a sign is displayed in violation of the rules of this chapter, or in violation of other applicable laws, rules, regulations, or policies regarding signs, each day is a separate violation.

D.    Interpretations. The development services manager, or such person designated by the city manager, shall interpret this chapter as the need arises; such interpretations may be appealed first to the planning commission and then to the city council. All interpretations are to be made in light of the policies of message neutrality and message substitution, and the overall purposes and intent of this chapter. Where a particular type of sign is proposed in a permit application, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this chapter, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a “structure” as defined in the zoning code or the building code, then the manager shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type that is expressly regulated or prohibited by this chapter, in light of the principles stated in this section.

E.    Message Neutrality. It is the city’s policy and intent to regulate signs in a manner consistent with the U.S. and California Constitutions, and which is content-neutral as to protected noncommercial speech.

F.    Message Substitution. Subject to the property owner’s consent, a constitutionally protected noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for the message displayed on any sign for which the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval, permitting, registration or notice to the city. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message.

Any on-site commercial message may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any other on-site commercial message; provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content.

This message substitution provision does not: (1) create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot or land use; (2) affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted; (3) allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its mounting device; (4) authorize the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message or in place of a noncommercial message; (5) authorize the conversion of an on-site commercial sign to full- or part-time use as general advertising for hire; or (6) authorize the conversion of a static image display to a different technology for display of image, such as digital display.

However, whenever a given parcel or land use has not used all of its permittable sign area, then the unused portion may be exercised for the display of signs displaying noncommercial messages; in such a case, a permit is required only if the sign qualifies as a structure which is subject to a building permit under the building code.

G.    Discretionary Approvals. Whenever any sign permit, variance, conditional use permit, sign program, or other sign-related decision is made by any exercise of official discretion, such discretion shall be limited to the non-communicative aspects of the sign, as defined herein, architectural compatibility of the proposed sign with the surrounding area, and other factors listed in this chapter.

When discretion is authorized, it may be exercised to the following factors, as applicable: style or character of existing improvements upon the site and lots adjacent to the site; construction materials and details of structural design; the number and spacing of signs in the area; the sign’s display area, height, and location in relation to its proposed use; the sign’s relationship with other nearby signs, other elements of street and site furniture and adjacent structures; form, proportion, and scale; potential effect of the proposed sign on driver and pedestrian safety; potential blocking of view (whole or partial) of a structure or facade or public view of historical, cultural or architectural significance; potential obstruction of views of users of adjacent buildings to side yards, front yards, open space, or parks; and potential negative impact on visual quality of public spaces. Discretion may not be exercised as to the graphic design or message content of the subject sign; however, graphic design themes, including color and coverage ratios, may be evaluated for sign programs pursuant to Section 18.04.100, but then only as to commercial messages on signs within the area subject to the sign program.

H.    Prospective Regulation. This chapter applies to signs that may be proposed or erected in the future, including those for which applications may be pending or anticipated at the time of adoption of this chapter. It also applies to existing signs which are not legal under prior law. All existing, permanent, legal signs may continue in use, provided that any change in use must comply with this chapter. All signs set forth in Section 18.04.110 shall be abated as set forth therein.

I.    On-Site/Off-Site Distinction. Within this chapter, the distinction between on-site signs and off-site signs applies only to commercial speech messages. It does not apply to signs displaying noncommercial messages or messages providing factual direction information.

J.    Noncommunicative Aspects. All rules and regulations concerning the noncommunicative aspects of signs, such as location, size, height, illumination, spacing, orientation, etc., stand enforceable independently of any permit or approval process.

K.    Legal Nature of Sign Rights and Duties. As to all signs attached to real property, the signage rights, duties and obligations arising from this chapter attach to and travel with the land or other property on which a sign is mounted, installed or displayed. A sign permit is an official authorization of legal right to a certain use of a particular parcel of land; it is not a certificate of ownership. This provision does not modify or affect the law of fixtures, sign-related provisions in private leases (so long as they are not in conflict with this chapter or other applicable law), or the ownership of sign structures. This provision does not apply to temporary handheld signs or visual images which are aspects of personal appearance. This provision does not prevent a sign owner from removing a sign structure from a given location and installing it in another location, so long as all then-current legal requirements applicable to the new location are satisfied.

L.    Owner’s Consent. No sign may be placed on private property without the consent of the legal owner or the property owner and all persons holding the present right of possession and control. Nothing in this chapter is intended to or shall be interpreted to override any sign restriction provisions in private agreements, such as leases or CCRs (covenants, conditions and restrictions) in homeowners’ association agreements.

M.    Signs as Accessory Uses. Unless otherwise provided herein, permanent structure signs displaying commercial messages are to be accessories to, auxiliary to, or appurtenant to another main, principal or primary use on the same parcel.

N.    Policy Regarding New Billboards. The city completely prohibits the construction, erection or use of any new billboards and off-site commercial signs without complying with the provisions of this chapter. No existing, legal billboard may be converted to digital display, electronic changeable image sign, or to function as a “message center” as that term is defined in Business and Professions Code Section 5216.4. This provision shall control over any other more specific provisions to the contrary within this chapter; provided, that this billboard policy applies only within the regulatory scope of this chapter; it does not apply to signs formally authorized by city or the local successor agency (LSA) on city or LSA owned, leased or controlled property.

This policy does not affect existing, legal billboards, or prevent relocation agreements, as authorized by Business and Professions Code Section 5412, so long as such agreements are not contrary to other applicable law. This policy does not prohibit permanent directional signs which are under four square feet in area or otherwise conform to the current edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Violation of this policy is declared to be a public nuisance which may be abated by any method authorized by law.

In adopting the “no new billboards” provision, the city council affirmatively declares that it would have adopted this billboard policy even if it were the only provision in this chapter. The city council intends for this billboard policy to be severable and separately enforceable even if other provision(s) of this chapter may be declared, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable.

O.    Mixed-Use Zones. In any zoning district where both residential and nonresidential land uses are allowed, the sign-related rights and responsibilities applicable to any particular parcel or land use shall be determined as follows: residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where a use of that type would be allowed as a matter of right, and nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where that particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a conditional use permit or similar discretionary process.

P.    The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as relieving or limiting in any way the responsibility or liability of any person erecting or owning any sign, for personal injury or property damage resulting from the placement of such sign, or resulting from the negligence or willful acts of such person, its agents, employees, or workers, in the construction, maintenance, repair, or removal of any sign erected in accordance with a permit issued under this chapter; nor shall it be construed as imposing upon the city or its officers or employees any responsibility or liability by reason of the approval of any signs, materials, or devices under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

18.04.030 General sign regulations.

A.    Structural Requirements for Freestanding Signs. All structural regulations, building permit fees, and other regulations of the latest edition of the Uniform Building Code, as adopted by the San Pablo Municipal Code, shall be and are expressly made applicable to signs. The structural safety of freestanding signs shall be computed on the same basis as building permits provided for in the building code. The determination of value or valuation under any provision of this chapter shall be made by the development services manager.

B.    Utility Clearance. The owner of any sign shall maintain legal clearance from communications and electrical facilities. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no sign shall conflict with any rule, regulation or order of the California Public Utilities Commission pertaining to the construction, operation and maintenance of public utility facilities.

All signs must be built and installed in conformance with the terms and conditions of the permit.

A.    General Requirement. No sign shall be erected or displayed without a sign permit or temporary sign permit, unless the sign is exempt under Section 18.04.060. The development services manager may require the removal, modification or relocation of an existing sign as a condition of sign permit or temporary sign permit approval if: (1) the proposed sign would be located on a site with an existing sign violation; or (2) the approval of the sign permit or temporary sign permit would result in a violation of the sign regulations.

B.    Sign Permit for Permanent Sign. A sign permit is required for a permanent sign including but not limited to the following types: wall sign, monument sign, shingle sign, multiple-story office sign.

C.    Temporary Sign Permit. Except as set forth in Section 18.04.070(A), a temporary sign permit is required for a temporary commercial sign. No permit is required for temporary noncommercial signs, but such signs must comply with Section 18.04.070(B).

D.    Design review of signs, pursuant to Section 17.18.090, is required for all signs that require a sign permit. Design review shall be conducted by development services planning staff or the planning commission, as set forth in Section 17.18.090(A)(4).

When any permit application fully complies with all applicable provisions of this chapter, and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations, and such laws, rules and regulations are not changed within the review period, then the permit shall be approved and issued within the required time. In the case of signs which are expressly exempt from the permit requirement, there is a right to erect, display and maintain such signs as are authorized by this chapter, subject to the applicable rules.

F.    Exemptions—Alterations. Signs legally existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are subject to a permit requirement only when a structural alteration is made, or the sign area is enlarged.

In the case of such structural alterations or expansion, or electrical changes, a permit is required.

G.    Application for Sign Review. Any person seeking a permit for a sign, for which review is required, shall submit to the development services manager a written application for such sign review.

In such case, the application fee is not refundable.

K.    Disqualification. No sign permit application will be approved if:

2.    There is any other existing code violation located on the site of the proposed sign(s) (other than an illegal or nonconforming sign that is not owned or controlled by the applicant and is located at a different establishment) which has not been cured at the time of the application, unless the noncompliance is proposed to be cured as part of the application;

3.    The sign application is substantially the same as an application previously denied, unless: (a) twelve months have elapsed since the date of the last application, or (b) new evidence or proof of changed conditions is furnished in the new application; or

L.    Multiple Sign Applications. When an application proposes two or more signs, the application may be granted either in whole or in part, with separate decisions as to each proposed sign. When a multiple sign application is denied in whole or in part, the development services manager’s written notice of determination shall specify the grounds for such denial.

M.    Signs Which Are Part of a Larger Project. Permit applications for sign programs as part of planned commercial, office-professional and industrial development shall include the above information as part of a site development plan.

All such applications are subject to design review.

N.    Revocation or Cancellation. The development services manager may revoke any approval or permit upon refusal or failure of the permittee to comply with the provisions of the permit and the requirement of this chapter, after written notice of noncompliance and at least fifteen calendar days’ opportunity to cure. The notice and opportunity to cure do not apply when a sign, by virtue of its physical condition, constitutes an immediate and significant threat to public safety.

O.    Permits Issued in Error. In the event that a sign permit is issued, and the issuance is found to be in error at any time before substantial physical work on actual construction has been accomplished, then the permit may be summarily revoked by the city simply by giving notice to the permittee; such notice shall specify the grounds for revocation. In such event, the applicant may reapply within thirty calendar days for a new permit, without paying a new application fee.

P.    Other Sign-Related Decisions. Challenges to or appeals of sign-related decisions, other than approval or denial of a sign review or permit, do not require a particular form, but must be in writing, signed by the applicant or challenger, and state the matter challenged and the grounds therefor. Such appeals shall use the same form as other zoning appeals.

Q.    Conditional Approval. A sign permit may be approved subject to conditions, so long as those conditions are allowed by this chapter or some other applicable law, rule or regulation.

R.    Safety Codes. When a sign qualifies as a structure under the building code, a building permit shall also be required. Compliance with all applicable safety codes shall be a condition of all sign permits.

T.    Timely Decision. Other than initial review for completeness, at each level of review or appeal, the decision shall be rendered in writing within sixty calendar days. The time period begins running when the application is complete (or is deemed complete because no notice of incompleteness has been given), or the notice of appeal has been filed, whichever applies. The timely decision requirement may be waived by the applicant or appellant. If a decision is not rendered within the required time, then the lower level decision shall be deemed affirmed.

U.    Appeal. Any decision on a sign permit application, or any other sign-related decision, may be appealed by any affected or interested person.

W.    Time and Method for Appeal. Any affected or interested person may appeal any sign permit, or other sign-related decision to the next level of review, by delivering a written notice of appeal to the city clerk within five calendar days of the subject decision. If the fifth calendar day falls on a day when city offices are closed, then the time period is extended until the next day that city offices are open. The notice of appeal must state particularly the matter appealed from, and the grounds for the appeal.

X.    Status Quo. During the pendency of review or appeal, the status quo of the subject sign(s) shall be maintained. This does not apply whenever a sign, by virtue of its physical condition, constitutes a threat to public safety.

Y.    Judicial Review. Following final decision by the city council, any concerned person may seek judicial review of the final decision on a sign permit application pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 or 1094.8, as applicable.

16.    Notwithstanding the maximum sign height, no freestanding pylon-supported sign shall project above the roofline of the building it identifies, except that freestanding signs may be as high as the highest point of the roof if the planning commission finds it necessary to identify the business to the traveling public.

1.    The area of a wall sign comprised of individual channel-type letters, numerals, symbols, or other similar components painted on or attached flat against the wall of a building, where such individual components are without integrated background definitions and are not within a circumscribed frame area, the total area of the sign shall be measured by the area enclosed by four vertical and horizontal straight lines outlining each word or symbol; and

2.    Where a freestanding monument or pylon-supported sign has two faces, the area of both faces shall be included in determining the area of the sign, except where the sign is double-sided or the two faces are placed back to back and are at no point more than two feet from one another, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of one face if the two faces are of equal area; if two faces are of unequal area, the area of the larger face shall be used. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

18.04.100 Planned sign program.
A.    Planned Sign Program. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 18.04.070, a planned sign program shall be required for any multiple-occupancy site or separately identifiable building group such as a neighborhood or community shopping center, or any other site containing at least forty thousand square feet of land area. Approval of the sign program shall be required for issuance of a sign permit. For a site on which a planned sign program has been adopted, the provisions contained in the planned sign program shall take precedence over the signage requirements of the applicable zoning district.

B.    Design Review. A planned sign program shall be subject to Section 17.18.090, Minor design review. The purpose of the program shall be to integrate signs with building and landscape design to form a unified architectural design statement. Design review shall be in conformance with Section 18.04.020(G). The planned sign program shall identify proposed sign locations for two or more buildings, building identification signs, sign types such as freestanding and monument signs, overall sign theme, and lettering styles, and such other information as may be required by the director.

C.    Planned Sign Program. Planned sign programs, approved prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, are allowed for themed areas unless the program is changed and becomes subject to approval by the planning commission. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

18.04.110 Nonconforming signs.
A.    Signs for Legal Nonconforming Uses. Subject to the provisions of this section, signs for legal nonconforming uses as defined in the zoning ordinance are permitted.

1.    Signs for a legal nonconforming use shall be deemed to comply with the provisions of this chapter if they comply with the sign regulations for the most restrictive zoning district that permits the nonconforming use as an allowed use. Such signs shall be permitted only as long as the nonconforming use is permitted. Any such sign legally existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which does not comply with the regulations of this chapter, shall be a nonconforming sign and shall be subject to alteration or removal in accordance with the provisions of subsection B of this section.

2.    Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this chapter, no new or additional sign shall be permitted for a nonconforming use after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

3.    The owner of the property on which the sign is located shall have the primary responsibility for removing the sign that is required to be removed or altered under this section.

B.    Any sign installed or maintained without required permits is considered an illegal nonconforming sign and must conform to the current code. All temporary signs must meet current requirements. The following provisions apply to legal nonconforming signs:

1.    Repairs and Minor Alterations. A nonconforming sign may be maintained and repaired. A nonconforming sign may also be altered as a change of copy, sign face or color. Any such minor alteration cannot increase the sign’s nonconformity. Any repair that qualifies as a major alteration or expansion must meet the requirements of the relevant subsection(s) of this chapter.

2.     Major Alterations. Alterations that change the sign location, frame, or sign support structure require the sign to meet current requirements.

3.    Expansion of the Sign. Any expansion of a sign structure that affects a nonconforming sign shall meet current requirements. Affected signs are signs that must temporarily or permanently change the location or appearance of the sign, excluding sign face changes.

4.    Approval of a Discretionary Review. The director or applicable approving body may require a nonconforming sign to meet current requirements as a condition of a sign permit, use permit or special development permit.

5.    Discontinuance of Use. A sign associated with a use that has been discontinued for a period of ninety days must conform to current requirements. Notice shall be sent to the property owner who will have ten days to respond to the notice.

C.    Effect of Discretionary Actions. Any nonconforming sign shall be made conforming as a condition of any use permit or variance approved for the use or structure associated with the sign. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

18.04.120 Enforcement.
A.    Permit Revocation. The planning commission is authorized and empowered to revoke any sign permit issued by the development services manager upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with any provisions of this chapter. The city council is authorized and empowered to revoke any sign permit issued by the planning commission upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with any provisions of this chapter.

B.    Public Nuisance. In the event any person should erect, alter, relocate or maintain a sign in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the same is declared a public nuisance which may be abated pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 8.02. The city attorney is further authorized to bring and prosecute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin such person from continuing such violation.

C.    No Duty To Enforce. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the city to enforce the prohibitions in this chapter against any or all properties which may violate this chapter. The city envisions that this chapter may be enforced, in the city’s prosecutorial discretion, only as to a limited number of problem properties, if resources so warrant.

D.    In addition to all other remedies, the city has a lien upon the sign which it removes for the cost of removal and may, but is not required to, keep possession of the sign until the owner redeems it by paying the cost of removal. The city may dispose of the sign thirty calendar days after removal without further liability to the owner by giving the owner notice that the owner may redeem the sign by paying the cost of removal. The cost of abatement is the responsibility of the owner. Each person who erects or maintains a sign which is subject to removal is jointly and severally liable for the cost of removal.

E.    Emergency Removal. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this section, in cases of emergency, the chief building official may cause the immediate removal of a hazardous, dangerous or defective sign, without notice, pursuant to the summary abatement procedures set forth in Chapter 8.02.

F.    Cost of Lien. Any sign removed by the code enforcement supervisor or designees pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall be considered a debt to the city by the owner of the sign and owner of the property, and may be recovered by a lien and special assessment against the property, as set forth in Chapter 8.02.

G.    Nonexclusive Procedure. The procedures set forth herein constitute an alternative procedure and shall not limit or restrict the city from the civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement of this chapter in any other manner provided by law. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

18.06.010 Authority, purpose, scope and intent.
A.    Authority. This chapter may be referred to as the city property sign ordinance. It is adopted pursuant to the city’s general and police powers, property rights, Government Code Sections 65850(b), 38774 and 38775, Business and Professions Code Section 5200 et seq., and Penal Code Section 556 et seq.

B.    Capacity. In adopting this chapter, the city acts in its proprietary capacity as to city property, as defined herein, and also pursuant to its police powers as to portions of the public right-of-way in which the fee title is not held by the city.

C.    Scope. This chapter states the intent, rules, regulations, and procedures regarding placement of signs on city property, as defined herein. This chapter does not apply when a special event is subject to a special event permit.

D.    Intent. The city declares its intent that all city property shall not function as a designated or limited public forum for sign display, unless some specific portion of city property is identified as a public forum of one particular type by some formal action of the council; in such case, the declaration as to public forum type shall apply strictly and only to the specified area and the specified time period. By adopting this chapter, the city council intends to balance the rights of free speech, protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and corollary provisions of the California Constitution, against the city’s own speech rights, its own property rights, and the public interests in reducing the visual clutter and safety risks that can result from excessive or inappropriate signage. The purposes and intents of this chapter include, but are not limited to:

1.    To accommodate the need for orderly expression in traditional public forum areas, such as streets, parks and sidewalks;

2.    To preserve and enhance the aesthetic appearance and natural beauty of the city;

3.    To serve the public interest in safety, both pedestrian and traffic;

4.    To safeguard and protect the public health, safety, and welfare through appropriate prohibitions, regulations, and controls on the design, location, and maintenance of signs on city property;

5.    To enhance the visual attractiveness of the city, for residents and visitors;

6.    To advance the goals, policies and programs of the general plan; and

7.    To allow private parties to place signs on certain areas of city property, subject to the rules and policies stated herein. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

18.06.020 Basic policies.
A.    Compliance Required.

B.    City’s Messages. Nothing in this chapter limits in any way the city’s ability to use city property for the expression of its own messages.

C.    Enforcement. The development services manager, public works director, code enforcement supervisor, or designees, are authorized to enforce and administer the provisions of this chapter. Any private party sign placed on city property or in the public right-of-way in violation of city policy is a trespass, and a public nuisance, and may be summarily abated by the city. Such unauthorized signs on city property also constitute misdemeanors under Penal Code Section 556.

D.    Interpretations. Interpretations of this policy shall be made initially by the development services manager or designee, whose decision may be appealed to the planning commission and then the city council under the appeal procedures set forth in Chapter 18.04. (Ord. 2015-003 § 1 (part), 2015)

7.    In order to serve the city’s interests in traffic flow and safety, persons displaying signs pursuant to this section may not stand in any vehicular traffic lane when a roadway is open for use by vehicles, and persons displaying signs on public sidewalks must give at least five feet width clearance for pedestrians to pass by. Signs and persons holding signs may not block the free and clear vision of drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians;
