vehicle owner of record's right to request a preliminary hearing as provided in § 35-1-22. Said
motor vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for in § 35-1-7

shall be returned to the person posting the bond. All bond money posted pursuant to this chapter
shall be held by the Village until a Hearing Officer issues a decision.

a preliminary hearing is received by the Village; provided that if the date for the preliminary
hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the

continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until a decision of the Hearing Officer presiding
at the administrative hearing held in accordance with § 35-1-7 is rendered, unless the owner

fee or other costs, or, if a cash bond had previously been posted, the cash bond shall be returned, and
the Village shall be liable to the owner of record for the cost of storage fees and reasonable attorneys'
fees.

the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to § 4-208 of the

persons using two-way live voice communication by telephone such as 9-1-1, shall, as a condition
to installation and continued operation of such equipment or service, execute a consent in such
form as may be prescribed by the Village Clerk that such owner, lessee or user shall pay the
Village a service charge for each alarm as provided in Chapter 150, Fees, Fines and Charges,

or owner will be notified.
Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided that "any such owner, lessee or user who fails to execute
the consent described in this section within 90 days from the effective date of this ordinance shall,

direct or indirect connection with the PSAP and shall discontinue using the services of any
intermediaries."

result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the Village,
preserve taxable values, and promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
Relationship of buildings to site.
The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition with the streetscape, and to
provide for adequate planting, safe pedestrian movement, and parking areas.

[Amended 2-19-2007 by FMC-414]
In general, maintenance and upkeep are required for all the parts and objects which compose the
Village's image. Lawns and planting require considerably more periodic attention than do
buildings; nonetheless, both require maintenance in order to retain a good appearance. Improper
and inadequate maintenance results in a bad appearance and decreases value. Therefore, it is
necessary that maintenance be a concern of the responsible commission or designated staff.
[Amended 7-7-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-1783]
Particular considerations.
Site.
Landscape materials, other than plantings, which have deteriorated or have been
damaged or defaced, shall be properly repaired or replaced.
Plant materials which have deteriorated or died shall be replaced with healthy plantings
of appropriate size to be harmonious with original design, or the area redesigned with
other treatment to provide an attractive appearance.
Plantings shall be kept watered, fed, cultivated, and pruned as required to give a healthy
and well-groomed appearance during all seasons.
Parking areas shall be kept in good repair, properly marked, and clear of litter and debris.
Vacant property shall be kept free of refuse and debris, and shall have the vegetation cut
periodically during the growing season.
Buildings and appurtenances.
Buildings and appurtenances, including signs, shall be cleaned and painted in a color
harmonious with the original design or repaired as required to present a neat
appearance.
Deteriorated, worn, or damaged portions shall be rebuilt or replaced.
Illumination elements of buildings and signs shall be kept in good repair so as to maintain
the effect for which they were designed.
Public areas in or adjoining the development.
Property owners or tenants are encouraged to maintain parkway planting areas adjacent
to their property in order to add to the aesthetic enhancement of the private property and
the overall attractiveness of the streetscape. (Note: Village approval is required before
planting is permitted within the public right-of-way. Also, county and/or state approval
may be required.)
Refuse containers of an aesthetically satisfactory design and color shall be placed in
locations which will encourage their use, to avoid littering of waste materials.
Street furniture shall be erected and secured properly, and shall be cleaned or painted
regularly to present an orderly appearance. Signs shall be treated similarly.
§ 120-3-7. Relationship to other ordinances.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to modify or alter the provisions of any
other chapter of the Municipal Code. In the event of a conflict between the requirements of this
chapter and those of any other chapter of the Municipal Code, the latter shall prevail and control.

with the Fair Housing Review Board. The Fair Housing Review Board shall have and execute with
respect to all dwellings and persons subject to this chapter the power:
To hold hearings on, and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to any
such complaint;
To administer oaths and take sworn testimony;
To issue subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses, the production of evidence, or both, in
the course of investigations and hearings authorized under this section, if there is reason to
believe that a violation has occurred and the testimony of the witness or the documents or
items sought by the subpoena are relevant to the investigation. A subpoena shall be served in
the same manner as subpoenas issued under the rules of the Illinois Supreme Court to
compel appearance of a deponent, and subject to the same witness and mileage fees fixed
by law for such subpoenas. A subpoena issued under this section shall identify the person to
whom it is directed and the documents or other items sought thereby, if any, and the date,
time and place for the appearance of the witness and production of the documents or other
items described in the subpoena. In no event shall the date for the examination or production
of evidence be less than seven days after service of the subpoena. No later than the time for
appearance or production required by the subpoena, the person to whom the subpoena is
directed may object to the subpoena, in whole or in part. The objection shall be in writing,
delivered to the Fair Housing Review Board, and shall specify the grounds for the objection.
For seven days after receipt of a timely objection to a subpoena, the Fair Housing Review
Board shall take no action to enforce the subpoena or to initiate prosecution of the person to
whom the subpoena is directed. During this seven-day period the Fair Housing Review Board
shall consider the grounds for the objection and may attempt to resolve the objection through
negotiation with the person to whom the subpoena is directed. The seven-day period may be
extended by the Fair Housing Review Board in order to allow completion of any negotiations.
The extension shall be, in writing, addressed to the person to whom the subpoena is directed,
and shall specify the date on which the negotiation period will end. Negotiations may include
such matters as the scope of the subpoena and the time, place and manner of response
thereto. The filling of an objection to a subpoena, and negotiations pursuant to an objection,
shall not constitute refusal to comply with the subpoena, or interference with or obstruction of
an investigation;
To seek temporary relief (judicial enforcement) and to enforce its orders in conformity with this
chapter;
To publish its findings of fact and issue orders in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter;

municipal officials of its activities and recommendations with respect to fair housing practice,
which written report shall be made public after submission to the Mayor and Trustees; and

rules and regulations as may be necessary and desirable to carry out the purpose of this
chapter.

the parties and schedule a conciliation meeting.
Conciliation.

The provisions of this chapter are cumulative with and in addition to other available remedies. Nothing
contained in this chapter shall prohibit the Village from collecting on fees, fines, and penalties in any
lawful manner; or enforcing its codes by any other means, including, but not limited to, injunction,
abatement, or as otherwise provided by law or ordinance.
§ 215-11-9. Public nuisance.

§ 215-11-10. Additional authority.
If the enforcement officer has reason to believe that a property subject to the provisions of this

undertake action to abate the violations as soon as possible to address the conditions of the real
property. Nothing herein shall limit the Village from abating any nuisance or unsafe condition by
any other legal means available to it.
If there is a finding that the condition of the property is posing a serious threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare, then the Village may take such action as permitted by law to abate the
violations and charge the mortgagee or owner with the cost of the abatement.
If the mortgagee or owner does not reimburse the Village for the cost of temporarily securing the
real property within 30 days of the Village sending the mortgagee or owner the invoice, then the
Village may lien the real property.

"Chronic nuisance property" means any property upon which two or more nuisance activities

been independently investigated and verified by any law enforcement agency or the Building
Department and the owner has failed to correct within the time period provided for compliance or

The Village hereby creates a Nuisance Property Registry and a property that is determined to be a
chronic nuisance property shall be placed on that registry.
§ 220-1-8. Inspection; reinspection.
[Amended 5-20-2019 by FMC-2019-8]
Upon a property being placed on the Nuisance Property Registry, it shall be subject to a health
and safety or nuisance inspection limited to but covering all the relevant nuisance activities. A
property shall be placed on the Nuisance Property Registry for 12 months until its end of the
registry period performance evaluation is performed as provided in this chapter.
Notice of inspection. The Building Department shall serve written notice of the date and time of
any inspection to be conducted under this chapter, by mailing such notice by first-class mail at
least 14 calendar days prior to the date of inspection to the owner at the address of the property
and to the taxpayer of record at the address shown on the county tax rolls. If the property has
been rented, the Building Department shall also mail the notice to the occupants of each rental
dwelling unit, the owner, and the owner representative (if applicable). The Building Department
shall also post official notice of the inspection in a conspicuous area upon the property. In the case
of multiple owners of the same property, notice to any one of the owners shall comply with the
notice requirement under this section.
Entry.
The owner shall provide the Inspector from the Building Department with access to the
property.
If the property is rented, the owner is responsible for obtaining the consent of the tenant of
any rental dwelling unit to permit entry. If the tenant does not consent to the entry for
inspection, the Building Department is authorized to seek an inspection warrant from a court
of competent jurisdiction. If a tenant or occupant of a rental dwelling unit refuses to allow the
inspection, the owner is not in violation of this section.
If the Inspector is prevented from inspecting the property and has reasonable cause to
believe that the property is so hazardous, unsafe, or dangerous as to require immediate
inspection to safeguard the public health or safety, the Inspector shall have the right to
immediately enter and inspect the property and may use any reasonable means required to
effect the entry and make an inspection.
Results of inspection.
If the Inspector finds no Village Code violations, the Inspector shall issue a notice of
compliance that shall state in plain language that the property is in compliance with all
applicable laws in the same manner as the notice of inspection provided for in § 220-1-8B
hereof.
If, upon inspection, the Inspector discovers one or more Village Code violations and any other
applicable law, the Inspector shall cause to be issued a notice and order to the owner to
correct the violations. The order shall state in plain language the violations of law found and
the sections of law with which the property is not in compliance.
The order shall also state that failure to correct the violations may result in additional
inspection fees and other enforcement actions. The Inspector shall mail the notice in the
same manner as the notice of inspection provided for in § 220-1-8B hereof and order to
the occupants of each dwelling unit, the owner, and the owner representative to the
addresses provided on the registration application.

If the Inspector determines that the conditions pose a present, imminent, extreme and
immediate hazard to health or safety, he or she shall order abatement of the conditions within
48 hours. Within 24 hours after the time to abate, the Building Department shall conduct a
reinspection of the property to determine compliance with the order. If the condition has not
been abated, the Building Department is authorized to make the necessary repairs to ensure
immediate repair of dangerous, life-threatening conditions.
Except as provided in Subsection D(3), the Building Department shall specify a reasonable
time period for correction of the violations, depending on the severity of the condition,
between 48 hours and 30 days from receipt of the order to correct the violations and schedule
a reinspection of the property. A fee for the additional inspection required under this
subsection shall be imposed. The Village may also commence any other enforcement
actions.
Except for conditions specified in Subsection D(3), if the violation has not been corrected by
the compliance date, but the owner has made significant progress in correcting the violation
since the prior inspection, the Building Department may grant a single extension of time not to
exceed 30 days. In determining whether to grant the extension of time, the Building
Department shall consider the frequency of prior inspections, the current condition of the
property, prior Village Code violations and whether the owner has other property with Village
Code violations.
After being added to the Nuisance Property Registry and having an initial inspection, the property
shall also be required to have a subsequent inspection six months after being placed on the
registry.
§ 220-1-9. Annual performance evaluation.
[Amended 5-20-2019 by FMC-2019-8]
At the end of the 11th month on the Nuisance Property Registry, the Building Department shall do
a review of the status of the property to determine if the property should be removed from the
registry or be required to remain on the registry for an additional twelve-month registry period.
Those owners who have resolved the issue(s) that caused their property to be placed on the
nuisance property registry and have had no or few violations will be removed from the registry
while those who have properties that continue to have violations shall remain on the registry.
§ 220-1-10. Fees established.
Inspection fee. An owner of property determined to be a chronic nuisance property shall pay a fee
of $150 per building, plus an additional $50 for each dwelling unit above two dwelling units. This
inspection fee shall cover the initial inspection, first reinspection at six months and the annual
performance evaluation provided for in § 220-1-9.
An owner shall pay a fee of $150 for any additional inspection not provided for in Subsection A
above.
The fee for rescheduling an inspection shall be $50.

independently review such reports and any other relevant facts or evidence to determine whether
criminal activity, nuisance activity or other prohibited conduct as provided in this chapter has occurred
at the property in question. Upon a finding that the complained of activity has occurred, the Chief of
Police may notify the owner, in writing, that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance
property. The notice shall contain the following information:
The street address and property index number sufficient for identification of the property.
A statement that the police department has information that the property may be a chronic
nuisance property, with a concise description of the criminal or nuisance activity(ies) that may exist
or that has occurred.
Service of notice shall be provided by either personal delivery or by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the owner at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance
property, or such other place which is likely to give notice of the determination by the Chief of
Police.
A copy of the notice shall also be served on the taxpayer of record at such address as shown on
the tax rolls of the county and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these persons are
different from the owner and shall be made either personally or by first-class mail, postage
prepaid.
Demand that the owner respond and meet with the Chief of Police within 20 days of receipt of the
notice. Refusal of receipt of the notice by any party to whom notice is sent shall be deemed receipt
of the notice for purposes of this section.
§ 220-1-12. Chronic nuisance property procedure for addressing
nuisance property.
At the meeting, the Chief of Police may request that the owner implement a reasonable abatement
plan designed to alleviate and prevent future occurrences of criminal activity or nuisance activity
upon the property. The mitigation or abatement plan shall be reasonable under the circumstances
in its objective, cost and scope, and shall be implemented within 60 days of the meeting with the
Chief of Police or such longer period if not practically feasible to do so within 60 days.
If the criminal activity or nuisance activity complained of has or is being conducted by a tenant
leasing the property, and such activity is a violation of the material terms of a lease agreement, the
Chief of Police may request that the owner evict the tenant and further request that future tenants
execute a "crime free lease addendum." If eviction is requested, the owner shall proceed with
such an action in good faith. The Village shall assist in the eviction action by reasonably
cooperating with the owner, manager(s) or person(s) in charge of the property, including, but not
limited to, providing law enforcement officers or other municipal employees as witnesses
regarding the nuisance activity if relevant.
When any party affected by this section responds and meets with the Chief of Police as required
above, no statements made in connection with the furnishing of that response or in a meeting shall
constitute or be used in any judicial or quasijudicial proceeding as an admission that any nuisance
activity has or is occurring at or on the property. This subsection does not require the exclusion of
any other evidence which is otherwise admissible and offered for any other purpose than an
admission by a person affected by this section.

At any hearing before the administrative adjudication hearing officer held in accordance with
Chapter 35 to determine whether the property in question is a chronic nuisance property, the
Village shall have the initial burden of proof to show, by a preponderance of evidence, that the
property in question is a chronic nuisance property. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to all
persons or entities that may be adversely affected by a decision declaring the property to be a
chronic nuisance property.
The Village's representative shall present evidence in support of its claim that the property is a
chronic nuisance property. The owner shall be permitted to rebut such evidence.
No continuances shall be authorized by the Administrative Hearing Officer in proceedings under
this section unless for good cause shown or except where a continuance is absolutely necessary
to protect the rights of any party to the proceeding. Lack of preparedness shall not be grounds for
a continuance.
At any time prior to the hearing date, the Administrative Hearing Officer may, at the request of
either party(ies), direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of
evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence including police reports shall be
admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonable, prudent persons in the
conduct of their affairs.
§ 220-1-14. Chronic nuisance property alternative enforcement.
Nuisance abatement: The Village, as an alternative to administrative adjudication, may commence
an action in the circuit court of Cook County for a determination that the property is a chronic
nuisance property and/or to abate a chronic nuisance property.
Nothing with respect to this section:
Limits enforcement pursuant to 50 ILCS 750/15.2 against any person calling the number
"911" for the purpose of making a false alarm or complaint and reporting false information,
from being charged with disorderly conduct as defined in 720 ILCS 5/26-1 or a similar
ordinance of this code; or
Prohibits claims made pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/9-1 et seq., of the forcible entry and detainer
statute, except where the tenant, lessee, or household member who was the victim of
domestic violence, sexual violence, stalking, or dating violence did not knowingly consent to
the barred person entering the premises or a valid court order permitted the barred person's
entry onto the premises; or
Prohibits the Village from enacting or enforcing ordinances to impose penalties on the basis
of the underlying criminal activity or local ordinance violation to the extent otherwise permitted
by existing state and federal law; or
Shall prevent the owner or Village from seeking possession solely against a tenant,
household member, or lessee of the premises who perpetrated the domestic violence, sexual
violence, or other criminal activity; or
Shall prevent the owner or Village from seeking possession against a tenant, lessee or
household member who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, sexual
violence, or has a disability, if that tenant, lessee, or household member has committed the
nuisance activity on which the demand for possession is based.

hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable federal or state laws or
regulations conflict with the requirements of this article, the utility shall comply with the
requirements of this article to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws
or regulations.

construction; or 25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case
of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this article.
Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a permit is required for work
pursuant to § 245-5-4 of this article. The telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation
available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the
requirements of Subsection A of this section.
Additional Village review of applications of holders of state authorization under the cable and video

state-issued authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed
granted 45 days after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon by the Village,
provided the holder has complied with applicable Village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
§ 245-5-6. Effect of permit.
Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the Village authorizes
a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article on Village rights-ofway,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
Duration. No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a period longer than six months
unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion.
Preconstruction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under
this article prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who
will perform any work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting
shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with such Village representatives
in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing
the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where
work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the
area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by
the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse the
permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations.
§ 245-5-7. Revised permit drawings.
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations
identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee
shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within 90 days after the completion of the
permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the
actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in
accordance with § 245-5-21 of this article. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms
to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess

of such intent to cancel or not to renew."

prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of
replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit
requirements required by Subsection A of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to
the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under Subsection A, or the requirements of Subsections B, C and D of this section. A
utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
Subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a private self insurer under the
Workers Compensation Act.

also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under
the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase
consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration
in the previous phase or phases, the Village Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of
sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable
to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this Subsection C for any single phase.
Withdrawals. The Village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and
its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within
the fourteen-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village
has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the
permittee; or
Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the Village determines can be remedied
by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has
been withdrawn from the Security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount
specified in Subsection C of this section.
Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security
fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the
Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum
balance required in Subsection C of this section.
Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on
deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other
applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all
accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover
any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the
permittee.
Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the security fund are in
addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized
by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or
otherwise violated.

completely block access to any residence, business or institution, the utility shall notify the
resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning time and duration of such work;
provided, however, that in cases involving emergency repairs pursuant to § 245-5-20 of this
article, the utility shall provide such notice as is practicable under the circumstances.
Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any deficiencies in traffic protection
requirements that are brought to the utility's attention by the Village.
§ 245-5-15. Location of facilities.
General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable to specific types of utility
facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of type, shall be subject to the general location
requirements of this subsection.
No interference with Village facilities. No utility facilities shall be placed in any location if the
Village Director of Public Works determines that the proposed location will require the
relocation or displacement of any of the Village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with
the operation or maintenance of any of the Village's utility facilities.
Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause only the minimum
possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and shall cause only the minimum
possible impact upon and interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners who adjoin said right-of-way.

The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not more than eight
feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the right-of-way line;
A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a highway only if other locations
are impracticable or inconsistent with sound engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable
may be installed in existing conduit without disrupting the pavement); and
In the case of an underground power or communications line, the facility shall be located
as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not more than five feet (1.5 m) from the
right-of-way line and any aboveground appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as practicable.
Facilities crossing highways.
No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing facilities installed between the
ditch lines or curblines of Village highways may require the incorporation of materials and
protections (such as encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to
the roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities shall not be located in cattle
passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at or as near to a 90° angle to
the center line as practicable.
Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or communication facility may
cross a highway only if:
It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's rules entitled, "Construction
of Electric Power and Communication Lines" (83 Ill. Adm. Code 305);
Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line of the highway and
outside of the clear zone; and
Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
Underground power or communication facility. An underground power or communication
facility may cross a highway only if:
The design materials and construction methods will provide maximum maintenance-free
service life; and
Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is provided in the initial
installation.

The Village may require any freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened
from view.
Facilities installed above ground. Aboveground facilities may be installed only if:
No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will employ suitable design and
materials, to provide the greatest protection of aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed
without adversely affecting safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, selfsupporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever practicable; the
installation of additional utility poles is strongly discouraged.
Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway structures only where the
utility has demonstrated that all other means of accommodating the facility are not
practicable. Other means shall include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater,
independent poles, cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated
from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure or potential,
present high degrees of risk and such installations are not permitted.
A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility installation on a bridge or
roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing.
Approval or disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:
The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be transmitted and an
evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in the event of damage to or
failure of the facility;
The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway structure in the
transportation system;
The alternative routings available to the utility and their comparative practicability;
The proposed method of attachment;
The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the proposed facility;
The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared to the risk involved.
Appearance standards.
The Village may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular locations in order to preserve
visual quality.
A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require extensive removal or
alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents
and property owners, and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being
traversed.

§ 245-5-16. Construction methods and materials.
Standards and requirements for particular types of construction methods.
Boring or jacking.
Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be accomplished from pits
located at a minimum distance specified by the Village Director of Public Works from the
edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall be excavated no more than 48
hours in advance of boring or jacking operations and backfilled within 48 hours after
boring or jacking operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly
marked and protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported,
braced, and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads that may
be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be permitted under the roadway.
Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six inches (0.15 m) in
diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and following pipe, and the diameter of the
auger shall not exceed the outside diameter of the following pipe by more than one inch
(25 mm).
Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings of six inches or less in diameter may
be accomplished by either jacking, guided with auger, or auger and following pipe
method.
Tree preservation. Any facility located within the drip line of any tree designated by the
Village to be preserved or protected shall be bored under or around the root system.
Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair, or maintenance on rights-of-way shall be
done in accord with the applicable portions of Section 603 of IDOT's "Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction."
Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the practicable minimum consistent
with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only 1/2 of any intersection may have an open
trench at any time unless special permission is obtained from the Village Director of
Public Works.
Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed excavated material
shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between
the roadway and the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed
to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow
for windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated
material shall be hauled to an off-road location.
Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip line of any tree designated by
the Village to be preserved.
Backfilling.
Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of facilities shall be backfilled
for its full width, depth, and length using methods and materials in accordance with
IDOT's "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction." When excavated
material is hauled away or is unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be
used.

For a period of three years from the date construction of a facility is completed, the utility
shall be responsible to remove and restore any backfilled area that has settled due to
construction of the facility. If so ordered by the Director of Public Works, the utility, at its
expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed
facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new pavement,
sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the Director of
Public Works.
Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair shall be permitted on a
highway only if that portion of the highway is closed to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set
forth in this Subsection A(4) is permitted under § 245-5-21, the following requirements shall
apply:
Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted as soon as
practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as designated by the
Director of Public Works.
Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon as practicable, and
temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided immediately. Any subsequent
failure of either the temporary repair or the restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by
the Village.
All saw cuts shall be full depth.
For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a concrete surface/base in the
last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three years, permits shall not be issued unless
such work is determined to be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary
and unforeseen before the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is
necessary for a JULIE locate.
Encasement.
Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the highway and any other
superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either by one-piece fabrication or by
welding or jointed installation approved by the Village.
The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-ofway
line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be located in the area established as clear
zone for that particular section of the highway.
In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall be furnished between
bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village-approved jointed pipe is used under the
roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed prior to highway construction and
carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell
and spigot type pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may be eliminated.
In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with installations of more
than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair; and
Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products pipeline, the facility shall be
located so as to provide that construction does not disrupt the right-of-way.

or other property.
These restrictions may be waived by the Director of Public Works when emergency work is
required to restore vital utility services.
Unless otherwise permitted by the Village, the hours of construction are those set forth in the
Building Code.
Location of existing facilities. Any utility proposing to construct facilities in the Village shall contact
JULIE and ascertain the presence and location of existing aboveground and underground facilities
within the rights-of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The Village will make its permit
records available to a utility for the purpose of identifying possible facilities. When notified of an
excavation or when requested by the Village or by JULIE, a utility shall locate and physically mark
its underground facilities within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in accordance with
the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.)
§ 245-5-17. Vegetation control.
Electric utilities: compliance with state laws and regulations. An electric utility shall conduct all
tree-trimming and vegetation control activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable
Illinois laws and regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement with the
Village as permitted by law.
Other utilities: tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is done by any other utility with
facilities in the right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and
regulations specifically governing same shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation,
but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit
required under this article.
Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree trimming permits shall include
assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are
experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be
tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment
of damages. The Village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for
trees removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or
unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the removal and replacement of trees
if trimming or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.

taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special significance. The required measures may
consist of higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

§ 245-5-18. Removal, relocation, or modifications of utility
facilities.
Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the Village, a utility shall, at its own expense,
protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the Village, any
utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within
the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the
following circumstances:
Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise
permitted by applicable law;
If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if
required;
If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in
violation of this article; or
If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license
or franchise.
Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The Village retains the right and privilege to cut or
move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the Village, as the Village may determine to
be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or
removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.
Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the Village,
the utility shall notify the Village within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice, the Village may
direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Village Director of Public Works
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In
the event that the Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by
giving notice of abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to
the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
§ 245-5-19. Cleanup and restoration.
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other property within 10
days after any portion of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the Village. This includes restoration of entrances
and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved
by the Village Director of Public Works. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of
backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a
condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The
time period provided in this section may be extended by the Village Director of Public Works for good
cause shown.

§ 245-5-20. Maintenance and emergency maintenance.
General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be
maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.
Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify noncompliance with normal
procedures for securing a permit:
If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall
take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the
public on the right-of-way, including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard
does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the
parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights
shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when
no other means of access to the facility is available.
In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the Village Director of Public
Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what
steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make
the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the Village police shall be notified immediately.
In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as
practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public.
Emergency repairs. The utility must file, in writing, with the Village a description of the repairs
undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after an emergency repair.
§ 245-5-21. Variances.
Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the provisions of this
article must do so in writing to the Village Director of Public Works as a part of the permit
application. The request shall identify each provision of this article from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
Authority to grant variances. The Village Director of Public Works shall decide whether a variance
is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual
basis.
Conditions for granting of variance. The Village Director of Public Works may authorize a variance
only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an
irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the
provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the
provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested
approach.
Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the
Village Director of Public Works may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable
standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which
carry out the purposes of this article.

E. Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination,
including denial of a variance, made by the Village Director of Public Works under the provisions
of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or
commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination.
The Village Board shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board's next regularly
scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board
shall timely decide the appeal.
§ 245-5-22. Violations and penalties.
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of
this article shall be subject to fine not less than $100 nor more than $750. There may be times when
the Village will incur delay or other costs, including third-party claims, because the utility will not or
cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another
allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing
the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review
or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility
that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
§ 245-5-23. Enforcement.
Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the Village
may have for enforcement of this article.
Article 6. Street Improvements for Utility Extensions
[Adopted 12-3-1990 by FMC-259 (Ch. 13, Art. V, of the 1964 Code)]
§ 245-6-1. Substandard roadways.
In all new developments described in § 245-6-3 below, in which access to the development is provided
by or from a roadway which is less than the standard required under the Village Subdivision
Regulations, the developer shall improve the substandard roadway to appropriate Village standards
and extend the improved roadway the full length of the property line adjacent to such roadway.
§ 245-6-2. Size of utilities.
In all new developments or additions described in § 245-6-3 below, in which Village utilities are
proposed or required to be extended to serve the development, such utilities shall be sized as required
by the Director of Public Works and extended along the full length of the property line adjacent and
parallel to the right-of-way or easement in which such utilities are placed. Unless otherwise required by
the Subdivision Regulations, this section shall not be interpreted to require that utilities which are
provided in a cul-de-sac be extended through the cul-de-sac unless specifically required by the
Director of Public Works, or that utilities be extended that could only service property in another
municipality.

The following developments shall comply with the requirements established in §§ 245-6-1 and 245-6-2
above:
All new residential developments wherein more than one dwelling unit is proposed.
All new commercial development or substantial additions.
All new special use development involving new buildings, or substantial additions.
All new public use development involving new buildings or substantial additions.
§ 245-6-4. Construction of streets and utilities.
In all developments where no street and/or utilities exist adjacent and parallel to the property from one
boundary line to the opposite boundary line, then the developer shall construct or financially provide for
the construction of said street and/or utilities as follows:
Where a street plan has been adopted for the area or property involved than full streets and
utilities shall be constructed by the developer in full accordance with such plan. Where the
property to be developed involves a corner lot or parcel, then a full street and utilities shall be
constructed along the entire boundary line of the property through which access to the property is
proposed to be provided, and the developer shall pay to the Village a sum which is equal to his
pro rated share of the cost of the street and utility improvements along the full length of the
property line adjacent and parallel to the planned street through which access to the property is
not provided. In no event shall full streets be constructed.
Where no street plan has been adopted for the area or property involved, then the Plan
Commission shall determine the logical placement of streets and utilities. In determining street and
utility placement, the Plan Commission shall consider the developer's proposal and how it meets
the needs of the development and provides for the future development of other property in the
area and such other matters as may be relevant. Once the Plan Commission has determined the
placement of streets and utilities, then construction or provision for construction shall be as
provided in Subsection A above unless specifically modified by the Plan Commission.
§ 245-6-5. Variations.
Any person seeking relief from the requirements established by §§ 245-6-1 through 245-6-4 may apply
for a variation from those requirements. The process to be applied to variations shall be that described
in the Subdivision Regulations. In addition to the criteria established for variations under the
Subdivision Regulations, the Plan Commission may consider the economic impact that the extensions
or roadway upgrade required by this article would have upon the development.

remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the Village not later than the last day of the month

form to be prescribed by the Village Manager, which shall contain such information as the Village

such amount shall be credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this article, from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous payment;
provided, however, the Village Manager may request, and telecommunications retailer shall
provide, written substantiation for such credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made
more than three years after the date of the erroneous payment unless:
The credit is used only to offset a claim of underpayment made by the Village within the
applicable statutory period of limitations, and
The credit derives from an overpayment made by the same telecommunications retailer
during the applicable statutory period of limitations.

base under any of the following acts as described immediately below:
Gross charges for purposes of the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act (35 ILCS 630/1 et
seq.);
Gross receipts for purposes of the municipal utility tax as prescribed in Section 8-11-2 of the

The Village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books and records of all
telecommunications retailers subject to this article to determine whether the telecommunications
retailer has properly accounted to the Village for the Village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any
underpayment of the amount of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the Village, plus 5% of the total amount of the
underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by the Village in conducting the
audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an
audit. Said sum shall be paid to the Village within 21 days after the date of issuance of an invoice
for same.

other proof necessary to establish these facts.
Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates. The owner shall pay fees to the towing
service operator for towing and storage on police-ordered tows at rates that do not exceed
maximum amounts to be administratively established by the Chief of Police and which may be
revised from time to time. The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and sign
concerning vehicle release requirements set forth in § 270-8-7A. However, nothing in this article is
intended to prevent a competitive towing service operator from charging less than the established
maximum rates for police-ordered or any other tows. In arriving at the maximum rates for various
services, the Chief of Police shall consider such matters as the prevalent market rates in the area
for the different types of vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for categories, such
as large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount of work required
to perform various types towing operations. For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such
as large or serious accidents, the Chief of Police is authorized to allow towing operators to charge
rates above those established for normal situations, which special charges must be based upon
the cost of services provided, taking into account such matters as the man-hours and equipment
time required for the job. A towing service operator must fully itemize, in writing, the details of such

Any territory hereafter annexed to the municipality which is not shown on the Zoning Map made a part
of this chapter shall automatically, upon such annexation, be classified as within the R-1 (45,000
square feet) Single-Family Residential District, and be subject to all conditions and regulations
applicable to territory in such district, until said territory is later zoned in a manner provided by law,
provided that, in the event the owner or owners of property to be annexed desire another zoning
district classification, in harmony with density and land use designations shown for said property in the
Comprehensive Plan for the environs of the Village, to be adopted at the time of the annexation, the
owner may petition for said zoning classification simultaneously with the petition for annexation. After
the zoning hearing and recommendation of the Plan Commission, the Village Board of Trustees may
either adopt, modify or reject the recommendations in the report of the Plan Commission relating to the
proposed zoning amendment, at the time of adoption of the final ordinance annexing the territory.
§ 285-4-4. Zoning of streets, alleys, public ways and railroad
rights-of-way.
All streets, alleys, public ways and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall
be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets,
public ways and railroad rights-of-way. Where the center line of a street, alley, public way or railroad
right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically
designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such center line.
§ 285-4-5. Boundary lines.
Wherever any uncertainty exists as to the boundary of any use district as shown on the Zoning Maps
incorporated herein, the following rules shall apply:
Where district boundary lines are indicated as following streets, alleys or similar rights-of-way, they
shall be construed as following the center lines thereof.
Where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall
be construed to be such boundaries.
Where a lot held in one ownership and of record at the effective date of this chapter is divided by a
district boundary line, the entire lot shall be construed to be within the less-restricted district;
provided, that this interpretation shall not apply if it increases the area of the less-restricted portion
of the lot by more than 20%.
§ 285-4-6. Minimum areas for zoning districts.
In addition to the conditions of the various zoning districts, the minimum areas that may constitute
a separate or detached part of any of the following zoning districts on the comprehensive
amended Zoning Map or subsequent amendments to said Zoning Map shall be as shown in the
following table. When an area proposed for rezoning abuts a district of the same or a less
restrictive classification than that proposed for such area, the area of the district abutting the area
proposed for rezoning may be included in the calculations in meeting the minimum area
requirements:

Telecommunication towers.
General guidelines and requirements.
Principal use. Telecommunication towers are classified as a principal use and any
installation of a tower or antenna must comply with district regulations, including, but not
limited to, setback requirements, lot size, coverage requirements and other such
requirements.
Prohibited facilities. No telecommunication towers shall be permitted in any residential
zone or the B-5 Central Business District.
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for approval of a telecommunication tower shall
provide to the Zoning Administrator an inventory of its existing antennas and towers that
are within 1 1/2 miles of the corporate limits of the Village of Flossmoor, including specific
information about the location, height and design of each tower or antenna. Applicants
are encouraged to submit an inventory of potential future tower sites within the Village.
The Zoning Administrator may share such information with other applicants applying for
administrative approvals or special use permits under this chapter or other organizations
seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction of the Village; provided,
however, that the Zoning Administrator is not, by sharing such information, in any way
representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
Abandonment. Notice shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator when a tower is
placed out of service. The owner shall remove towers that are not used for a period of six
months or more within 120 days of receipt of notification to that effect.
Telecommunications towers special use criteria.
Communication companies are encouraged to locate telecommunication antennas on or
in structures other than a tower. Such structures may include church steeples,
transmission line towers, utility/light poles, water towers, etc. Where such facilities are not
available, co-location of facilities is encouraged.
When a new tower is proposed to be sited, the following standards shall be used in the
approval of the siting of new towers:
Evidence that the applicant has investigated the possibilities for locating the
proposed facilities on an existing tower, the use of stealth technology or other
location district where the antennas would be permitted as an administratively
approved use where a minimal level of coverage can be provided. Such evidence
shall consist of:
Copies of letters sent to owners of all existing towers within a one-mile radius of
the proposed site, requesting the following information:
Tower height;
Existing and planned tower users;

cannot be located on an existing tower.
A summary explanation of why the applicant believes that the use of an
alternative tower structure is not possible.
Provision of sound engineering evidence demonstrating that location in the
proposed district is necessary in the interest of public safety or is a practical
necessity.
Evidence that the communications tower is structurally designed to support at least
one additional user, and the special use application includes a statement that the
owner of the tower is willing to permit other users to attach communication facilities,
on a commercially reasonable basis, which do not interfere with the primary purpose
of the tower. The tower owner may require that such other users agree to pay
reasonable compensation to the owner for any liability which may result from such
attachment. The site plan shall indicate a location for at least one equipment building
in addition to that proposed for use by the applicant. Priority for co-location on the
proposed tower shall be given to antennas that will serve a public safety need for the
community.
Landscape buffering and screening of the site shall be installed in order to provide
spatial separation and create visual block from adjacent properties and streets. The
buffer shall be installed around the outside of all improvements on the site, including
the tower and guy anchors, any ground buildings or equipment, and security fencing.
The tower's guy anchors may be screened or fenced separately in order to comply
with the requirements of this subsection.
No outside storage shall be allowed on any telecommunication facility site.
Associated buildings located at a tower site shall not be used as an employment
center for any worker. This provision does not prohibit the periodic maintenance or
periodic monitoring of equipment and instruments.
Any lighting shall not project onto surrounding residential property.
The color of the tower shall be neutral, except to the extent required by federal law,
so as to minimize its visual impact.
In order to protect the public from unnecessary exposure to electromagnetic
radiation, the tower owner shall provide documentation, such as a signed affidavit
from a qualified expert, indicating that the power density levels do not exceed levels
permitted by the FCC.
No commercial advertising shall be allowed on the tower or its related facilities.
Setback of the base of the tower from all adjacent property lines shall be one foot for
each foot in height. To encourage shared use of towers, applications for towers
which will operate with more than one user immediately upon completion may have
a ten-percent reduction in the required setbacks, but in no case shall the setback be
less than those required for the underlying zoning district. Also, to encourage the

reduction in the required setbacks. In no case shall the setback be less than those
required for the underlying zoning district. Said setback reductions shall only be
allowed upon a professional engineering certification which states that the structure's
construction will cause the tower to crumble inward so that in the event of collapse
no damage to structures on adjacent zoning lots will result.

The B-4 Office District is a district designed to provide a place for certain business office activities in a
predominantly residential community. By limiting the uses and by requiring yard and landscaping

business activities would be incompatible with adjacent residential areas. In some cases the B-4
District may be considered a transitional use between business and residential areas.

Article XX. Planned Unit Development
§ 285-20-1. Purpose.
The purpose of the planned unit development regulations is to encourage and allow more creative
and imaginative design for land developments than is possible under the more conventional
zoning regulations. The planned unit development also provides for more efficient use of the land
and thus results in more economical land development. Preservation of natural site qualities,
better urban amenities, more open space and a higher quality project are the normal results of the
planned unit development process.
The following objectives may be obtained through the use of the planned unit development
procedure:
To permit a maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public by allowing a
development that would not be possible under the strict application of the other sections of
this chapter.
To promote a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in
better design and development, with the inclusion of aesthetic amenities.
To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms and building relationships with
a possible mixing of different urban uses in an innovative design.
To encourage a pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic and
geological features and environmentally appropriate features.
To provide for the prevention and/or control of soil erosion, surface flood and the preservation
of subsurface water.
To create a method for the permanent preservation of common open space for the continued
use and enjoyment of the residents of the development.
To provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities, schools and other public
and private facilities.
To promote the more efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of utilities,
streets and other facilities.
To encourage a land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals and
welfare.
To create a method for the permanent preservation of architectural and/or historic landmarks.
The planned unit development is intended to provide for projects incorporating a single type or a
variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a unit. The planned unit development
should provide amenities not otherwise required by law and often establishes facilities and open
space greater than the minimum required by law.
Such development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots to be sold, unsubdivided single
ownership, separate condominium ownership of structures or other ownership methods, and shall
provide for development by means of a planned unit development plat which establishes the
location and extent of the features of the planned unit development in keeping with the purpose of
the plan.

The unique and substantially different character of planned unit developments requires their
administrative processing as a special use under this chapter. Planned unit developments are
more complex and of a different character than other specific and additional procedures,
standards and exceptions to govern the recommendations of the Zoning Board and the action of
the Board of Commissioners.
§ 285-20-2. Procedure.
[Amended 9-16-2019 by FMC-2019-14]
Planned unit development applications shall be made as hereinafter provided and shall be
accompanied by the required plats and documents. Detailed plans, drawings and other
information as specified in this chapter shall be required at the time of the various phases,
meetings and hearings as detailed herein. Each stage shall be reviewed and certified by the
Zoning Administrator as being in accordance with the planned unit development requirements
before proceeding to the next stages. The approval process shall include the following stages:
Preapplication conference: introductory meeting held with Village staff as set forth in § 285-
20-3 of this chapter.
Concept PUD plan review: an informal review of overall concept conducted by the Plan
Commission to provide constructive feedback to petitioner on the plan as set forth in § 285-
20-4 of this chapter.
Preliminary PUD plat: first, a technical review of detailed plans by the Zoning Administrator
and his or her designees; a public hearing is then conducted by the Plan Commission; final
determination is made by the Village Board, as set forth in § 285-20-5 of this chapter.
Final PUD plat: final determination made by the Village Board, as set forth in § 285-20-6 of
this chapter.
The final two stages of the PUD process, preliminary PUD plat and final PUD plat may be
submitted and reviewed concurrently, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, based upon the
following criteria:
The PUD plan forwards the goals of the Village's planning objectives and official plans.
The PUD plan requires limited variances from the use or bulk regulations of the
conventional/underlying zoning district in which it is located.
The benefit of the PUD plan shall forward or exceed the goals of the stated development
standards and regulations of Village ordinances.
§ 285-20-3. Preapplication conference.
[Amended 9-16-2019 by FMC-2019-14]
Purpose. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to provide information, guidance and
assistance to the applicant before preparation of the concept plan so that the applicant may
receive informal input on:
Whether the proposed planned unit development will be in conformity with the planning and
other development goals and the policies of the Village of Flossmoor.
Whether the existing zoning and land use in the general area of the planned unit development
is appropriate for a planned unit development.

regulation, provided that the content and size of the sign do not exceed the requirements of such
law, order, rule or regulation.
Small signs not exceeding two square feet in area displayed on private property for the
convenience of the public, including directional or informational signs, but excluding advertising
signs. These signs permitted are exempt from the permit required, but must comply with all of the
other regulations of this article.
"No trespassing" signs. "No trespassing" signs or other such signs regulating the use of a

Flashing or moving signs. No flashing signs, rotation or moving signs, animated signs, signs with
moving lights or creating the illusion of movement shall be permitted, except as specifically
allowed by § 285-22-9L. A sign whereon the current time and/or temperature is indicated by
intermittent lighting shall be deemed to be a flashing sign.

include any structural or framing elements lying outside the limits of such sign and not forming an
integral part of the display. For computing the area of any wall sign which consists of letters
mounted or painted on a wall, the area shall be deemed to be the area of the smallest rectangular
figure which can encompass all of the letters.
Traffic safety. No sign shall be maintained at any location where by reason of its position, size,
shape or color it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of or be confused with any
traffic control sign, signal or device, or where it may interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic.
Obsolete and off-premises signs. No sign shall be permitted which advertises a business which is
not being presently conducted on or adjacent to premises on which the sign is located. Any
obsolete sign shall be removed within 10 days of written notification from the Zoning Administrator.
All signs shall be maintained to prevent deteriorating or hazardous or unsafe conditions. Such
conditions apply to structural soundness of a sign, its base, or method of attachment to a building;
safety of any electrical elements; prompt repair of any damaged elements; and painting or other
maintenance measures as may be reasonably required by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator, after an inspection of a sign, may order the repair or maintenance steps required to
eliminate the deficiency.

Article XXIV. Nonconformities
§ 285-24-1. Purpose.
This chapter establishes districts, each of which is an appropriate location only for the uses,
buildings and structures permitted therein by this chapter. Within such districts, however, there

https://ecode360.com/print/FL3207?guid=27491810,27491830,27485278,27485306,27491942,27485427,27491956,27491972,27491997,33702… 376/404

exist nonconformities that were lawful before the effective date of this chapter, but that could not
be newly created under the terms of this chapter.
Recognizing the legitimate interest of those who lawfully established these nonconformities, this
article is intended to permit most such nonconformities to continue as hereinafter provided. It also
recognizes and declares, however, that nonconformities substantially and adversely affect the
orderly development, maintenance, use and taxable value of other property in the district—
property that is itself subject to the regulations of this article. Therefore, it is necessary and
consistent with the establishment of districts to regulate nonconformities strictly and to encourage
that they be brought into eventual compliance with the standards of this chapter.
§ 285-24-2. Lots smaller than minimum.
In residential districts. In any residential district, notwithstanding regulations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling (or an addition thereto) may be erected on a lot
consisting entirely of a tract of land that:
Has less than the prescribed minimum lot area or width, or both, but that no lot with less than
a forty-foot width shall be considered buildable;
Is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from
adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such area and width at such
location was not prohibited by any ordinance; and
Has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of land continuously
during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been prohibited by the chapter.
Construction permitted by this section shall comply with all regulations (except lot area and width)
applicable to single-family dwellings in the districts in which the lot in question is located.
§ 285-24-3. Nonconforming buildings that do not meet bulk
regulations used for permitted uses.
A building that contains no nonconforming use but which does not comply with the applicable bulk
regulations may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
regulations:
Enlargement, repair or alterations. Such building may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or
structurally altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or
structural alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of
existing nonconformity of all or any part of such building.
Damage or destruction. In the event that any such building is damaged or destroyed, such building
may be restored, but such restoration shall not create any additional nonconformity.
Moving. No such building shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatever to any
other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire building shall thereafter conform to

Ordinary repair and maintenance.
Work may be done on ordinary maintenance and repairs, and on repair, replacement,
installation and relocation of nonbearing walls and nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring and
plumbing, provided that this provision does not authorize any violation of any other provisions
contained in this section.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of a building or structure, in accordance with the order of a public official who is
charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such building or other structure to
be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition.
Structural alteration. No structural alteration shall be made unless the entire building or structure
and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged or increased in
intensity. Such prohibited activities include, without being limited to:
Extension of such use to any building or structure or land area other than one occupied by
such use on the effective date of this chapter (or on the effective date of a subsequent
amendment thereto that causes such use to become nonconforming).
Extension of such use within a building or structure to any portion of the floor area that was
not occupied by such use on the effective date of this chapter (or on the effective date of a
subsequent amendment thereto that causes such use to become nonconforming), provided
that such building or other structure was lawfully designed or arranged for such use on such
effective date.
Any increase in the number, area or size of signs accessory to such use.
Enlargement. No building or structure that is devoted in whole or any part to a nonconforming use
shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such building or other structure and the use
thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Damage or destruction. In the event that any building or structure that is devoted, in whole or in
part, to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means, to such an extent that the
cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before such damage or destruction exceeds
75% of the current replacement cost of the entire building or structure, exclusive of foundations,
such building or structure shall not be restored unless it and its use shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located. Moreover, no repairs or restoration shall be made
unless a building permit is obtained, and restoration is actually begun, within six months after the
date of such damage or destruction, and is diligently pursued to completion.
Moving. No building or structure that is devoted, in whole or in part, to a nonconforming use shall
be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or
other lot, unless the entire building or structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved. Moreover, no nonconforming use
of land shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatever, to any other location on the
same or any other lot unless such use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located after being moved.
Change.
If all or substantially all of a building or structure was originally designed or intended for a use
which is permitted in the district in which such building or structure is located, a
nonconforming use of such building or structure shall not be changed to any use other than
one permitted in such district. A nonconforming use of any other building or structure may not
be changed to another nonconforming use unless the Zoning Board of Appeals finds, either
by general rule or by the making of findings in the specific case, that the proposed use is

equally appropriate or more appropriate in the district than is the existing nonconforming use.
In permitting such change, the Board may impose appropriate conditions and safeguards in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure or in connection with
which any building or structure is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall
not be changed other than to a use permitted in the district in which the land is located.
When a nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be
changed back to a nonconforming use.
Discontinuances.
If a nonconforming use of a building or structure or part thereof is discontinued for a period of
one year, such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be reestablished, and any subsequent
use or occupancy of such building or structure shall conform to the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
If a nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or structure or in connection with
which any building or structure is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, is
discontinued for a period of six months, such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be
reestablished, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land shall conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
Nonconforming accessory uses. No nonconforming accessory use shall continue after the
principal use it serves has been abolished.
§ 285-24-5. Existing special uses.
Where a use exists lawfully on the effective date of this chapter and is permitted by this chapter only as
a special use in the district in which it is located, such use shall not be deemed a nonconforming use,
but shall without further action be deemed a lawful special use in such district.
§ 285-24-6. Nonconforming signs.
Continuation of legal nonconforming signs. With the exception of those signs subject to the
provisions of Subsection B, a legal nonconforming sign may be continued and shall be maintained
in good condition, but it shall not be changed to another nonconforming sign; structurally altered
(except to meet safety requirements) so as to prolong the life of the sign; altered so as to increase
the degree of nonconformity of the sign; expanded; reestablished after its discontinuance for 90
days; continued in use after cessation or change of the business or activity to which the sign
pertains; or reestablished after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction
exceeds 50% of the appraised replacement cost (as determined by the Zoning Administrator).
Conformance provisions. Any sign erected or constructed prior to the enactment of this code, or
any sign subject to the provisions of this chapter by reason of annexation to the Village, and which
sign is a legal nonconforming sign as defined herein, shall be brought into conformance or
removed in accordance with the following provisions:
Any existing individual sign which exceeds the maximum area or height limitations of this
chapter by 10% or less may be considered to be a conforming sign and need not be removed

Signs that may be continued.
Any sign that is an accessory sign to an auto service station of the type of construction

If the Zoning Administrator shall find that any sign is maintained in violation of the provisions
of this article, the Zoning Administrator shall give written notice to the owner or person entitled
to possession of the sign or the owner of the property where the sign is located. If such
person fails to alter or remove the sign so as to comply with this article within 30 days after
receipt of such notice, the Zoning Administrator may cause such sign to be altered or
removed at the expense of the owner or person entitled to possession of the property or sign,
and shall, upon the determination of such expenses, certify the same to the Village Manager.
The Village Manager shall notify the owner or person entitled to possession of the sign or
property of the total costs incurred for such alteration or removal of the sign, and if that person
shall fail within 30 days after the date of notification to pay the entire costs and expenses of
such repair, alteration or removal, then such costs and expenses shall become a lien against
the property, and the Village Manager shall certify the same to the Cook County Treasurer for
collection in the same manner as general property taxes are collected.
The amount certified by the Village Manager to the County Treasurer for collection shall
include the actual cost of repair or removal of said sign, plus 15%, and in addition thereto,

have the power and duty to hold public hearings and make recommendations to the Board of
Trustees to determine and vary the applications of such regulations, in harmony with their general
purpose and intent, but only in accordance with the requirements hereinafter set forth.
Application and notice of hearing. An application for a variation shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator, who shall forward a copy of the application to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The
application shall be in such form, contain such information, and be accompanied by such plans as
the Board may by rule require. The Board shall hold a public hearing on such application not more
than 60 days after its filing. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing shall be published
at least once, not more than 30 days or less than 15 days before the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village.
Standards for variations. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not recommend nor shall the Board of
Trustees vary the regulations of this chapter in any manner prohibited by Subsection E. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall not recommend that the Board of Trustees grant a variation unless
the Zoning Board shall make findings of fact, based upon the evidence presented to it in that
specific case, that:
[Amended 3-17-1986 by Ord. No. 804]
Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved, a particular hardship or practical difficulty to the owner, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, would result if the strict letter of the regulation were
carried out.
The conditions upon which the petition for a variation are based are unique to the property for
which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property within the
same zoning classification.
(Reserved)[1]
Editor's Note: This subsection was repealed 1-5-1988 by Ord. No. 861.
The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any persons presently having an
interest in the property.

The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other
property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property,
or substantially increase the congestion of the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or
endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
Conditions in the area have substantially changed, and at least one year has elapsed, since
any denial of any prior application for substantially the same variation.
The Board shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a
variation as may be necessary to assure compliance with the above standards, to reduce or
minimize the effect of such variation upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry
out the general intent of this chapter. Failure to comply with such conditions or restrictions shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
Prohibited variations. The Board of Trustees shall not in any event grant any variation that:
Permits in any district a use not listed by this chapter as a permitted use in such district.
Decisions. Not more than 30 days after the close of the public hearing, the Zoning Board shall
make its findings of fact and its determination, in writing, and shall forthwith transmit a copy
thereof to the Board of Trustees. The concurring vote of four members of the Zoning Board shall
be necessary to recommend a variation. Where a building permit is required, no ordinance passed
by the Board of Trustees shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the date of such
order unless a building permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a
building is started or the use is commenced within such period. If any of the benefits conferred by
any variation, whether heretofore or hereafter granted, are abandoned or are not utilized for any
continuous period of one year, said variation shall, to the extent of such abandonment or nonuse,
become void. Any variation which fails to receive the recommendation of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not be granted except by the favorable vote of 2/3 of all Trustees of the municipality.
Every variation shall be accompanied by findings of fact describing the practical difficulty or
particular hardship, and shall specify the reason or reasons for making the variation.

§ 285-26-8. Appeals.
Scope of appeals. An appeal, in which it is alleged that there is error in any decision made by the
Zoning Administrator under this chapter, may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals by any
party aggrieved by such decision or by any officer of the Village. Such an appeal shall be taken
within 45 days of the action complained of by filing with the Zoning Administrator and the Zoning
Board of Appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator
shall, without delay, forward to the Board a copy of the notice of appeal, together with the record
upon which the decision was made.
[Amended 3-17-1986 by Ord. No. 804]
Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the decision appealed
unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board, after the notice of the appeal has been filed,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed unless
by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application,
on notice to the Zoning Administrator.
Hearing and decision. The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the
appeal and give notice thereof to the parties, including the appellant, the Zoning Administrator and

Zoning Administrator.
[Amended 3-17-1986 by Ord. No. 804]
§ 285-26-9. Special use permits.
Purpose. This chapter is based upon the division of the Village into districts, within which the uses
of land, and the uses and bulk of buildings and structures, are substantially uniform. It is
recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics,
can only be properly classified in any particular district or districts upon consideration in each case
of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at
the particular location. Such special uses fall into two categories:
Uses publicly operated or traditionally related to a public interest; and
Uses entirely private in character, but of such nature that their operation may give rise to
unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property, public facilities or the
Village as a whole.
Authority. Special use permits may be granted by the Board of Trustees, but only in accordance
with the requirements hereinafter set forth.
Application and notice of hearing. An application for a special use permit shall be filed in triplicate
with the Zoning Administrator, who shall forward a copy of the application to the Plan Commission.
The application shall be in such form, contain such information and be accompanied by such
plans as the Plan Commission may by rule require. The Plan Commission shall hold a public
hearing on such application not more than 60 days after its filing. Notice of the time and place of
such hearing shall be published at least once, but not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days
before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village.
Report. Within 60 days after the close of the hearing, unless the applicant shall have consented to
a longer period, the Commission shall transmit to the Board of Trustees a written report giving its
findings and recommendations for action to be taken by the Board of Trustees on the application.
The report shall include any recommended conditions or restrictions exceeding the minimum
requirements otherwise provided herein to be imposed upon the premises benefited by the special
use permit.
Standards for special use permits. No special use permit shall be granted unless:
The proposed use is designated by this chapter as a special use in the district in which the
use is to be located.
The proposed use will comply with all applicable regulations in the district in which the use is
to be located. However, the Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees
may approve exceptions to site and structure requirements and other regulations for the
standard zoning districts, subject to the standards for special uses provided for herein.
The location and size of the proposed use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved
in or conducted in connection with it, the size of the site in relation to it, and the location of the
site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that it will be in harmony with the
appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is located.
The location, nature and height of buildings, walls and fences, and the nature and extent of
the landscaping on the site are such that the use will not unreasonably hinder nor discourage

the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use, properly located, and suitably
screened from adjoining uses, and the entrance and exit drives will be designed so as to
prevent traffic hazards and nuisances.
The proposed use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the
neighborhood.
The Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and restrictions exceeding the minimum
requirements otherwise provided herein upon the premises benefited by a special use permit
as may be necessary to assure compliance with the above standards, to reduce or minimize
the effect of such permit upon other properties in the neighborhood and to better carry out the
general intent of this chapter. Failure to comply with any such condition or restriction shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
Effect of decision. No special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the
date it is granted unless a building permit or an occupancy certificate is obtained within such
period and the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within such
period. If any special use is abandoned or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, the
special use permit for such use shall become void, and such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished unless a new special use permit is obtained.
