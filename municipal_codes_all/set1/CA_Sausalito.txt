The City Council finds that the enforcement of the Sausalito Municipal Code is an important public service and is vital to the protection of the public’s health, safety and quality of life.

[Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

1.10.020 Definitions.

1.10.040 Compliance order issuance.
A. When an Enforcement Officer observes a correctable, continuing violation of the Sausalito Municipal Code creating no immediate danger to health or safety, the Enforcement Officer may issue a compliance order to any responsible person.

If all violation(s) specified in the compliance order are not corrected within the time set forth in the compliance order, the Enforcement Officer may issue an administrative citation to the responsible person(s). Issuance of an administrative citation does not alter any obligation to comply fully with the compliance order. [Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

1.10.050 Administrative citation issuance.
A. When an Enforcement Officer observes a violation of the Sausalito Municipal Code other than a continuing, correctable violation of the Sausalito Municipal Code creating no immediate danger to health or safety, or when all violation(s) in a compliance order have not been corrected within the time set forth in that compliance order, the Enforcement Officer may issue an administrative citation to any responsible person.

1.10.060 Notices.
All notices, including compliance orders and administrative citations, required under this chapter shall be served on the responsible person(s) in accordance with the following provisions:

A. Notices may be personally served on a responsible person. When an Enforcement Officer issues a compliance order or an administrative citation in the presence of a responsible person, that responsible person shall be asked to sign the compliance order or administrative citation to acknowledge receipt. A responsible person’s failure or refusal to sign a compliance order or an administrative citation shall not affect the validity of that compliance order or administrative citation; and a responsible person’s signature on any administrative citation shall not constitute an admission of responsibility.

B. Notices may be mailed to the responsible person by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. Simultaneously, the same notice may be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid. If a notice sent by certified mail is returned unclaimed, service by first-class mail shall nevertheless be effective if that mail is not returned.

If the violation consists of a condition of real property or otherwise affects real property, such notice shall be addressed to the responsible person at that property’s address, unless the Enforcement Officer knows or has reason to know that the United States Postal Service does not deliver mail to that property. In addition, if the Enforcement Officer’s reasonable investigation reveals a different home or business address for the responsible person, a copy of the notice shall also be sent to this alternate address by first-class mail, postage prepaid.

C. If any notice is not personally served on a responsible person, a copy of that notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property where the alleged violation occurred or existed.

D. If a compliance order or administrative citation is issued for violation of the Sausalito Municipal Code by a business or other organization, and if the responsible person cited is not the sole owner of that business or other organization, a copy of the compliance order or administrative citation and of any other notices required in connection with that administrative citation shall also be personally delivered or shall be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the owner or director of that business or other organization, as may be revealed by the Enforcement Officer’s reasonable investigation.

E. If a compliance order or administrative citation is issued for a violation of the Sausalito Municipal Code existing on real property, and if the responsible person cited is not shown in the official records of the County of Marin as the sole owner in fee simple of the real property, a copy of the compliance order or administrative citation and of any other notices required in connection with that administrative citation shall also be personally delivered or shall be sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to any owners of interests in that property that may be affected by the violation, at the address shown on the last equalized County assessment roll, and at such other address as may be revealed by the Enforcement Officer’s reasonable investigation.

F. If the Enforcement Officer does not succeed in serving the responsible person personally, and if the Enforcement Officer’s reasonable investigation reveals no home or business address for the responsible person, and if the violation does not consist of any condition of real property, the Enforcement Officer shall cause the notice to be published once a week for four successive weeks in a local newspaper published at least once per week.

G. Service of any notice in accordance with these requirements may be proven by declaration or affidavit. Service is complete upon personal delivery, upon deposit with the United States Postal Service, or upon completion of publication according to subsection F of this section. Failure of any person with an interest in the compliance order or administrative citation to receive properly served notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings under this chapter. [Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

The responsible person requesting the hearing shall deposit with the City either the amount of the fine or an application for a hardship waiver as described in SMC 1.10.080. If the deadline for requesting a hearing falls on a weekend or on another date that City offices are closed for all of the normal business day, then the deadline shall be extended until 5:00 p.m. on the next regular City business day.

B. The City shall hold a hearing within 30 days of receiving a hearing request that complies fully with subsection A of this section.

Either the responsible person or the City may request a continuance of the hearing to a mutually agreeable date, but in no event may the hearing begin later than 60 days after the City receives a hearing request, accompanied by either deposit of the fine or a completed hardship waiver application.

C. The City Manager shall designate a Hearing Officer to hear and decide appeals of administrative citations. This Hearing Officer may, but need not, be an employee of the City of Sausalito. The employment, performance evaluation, compensation, and benefits, if any, of this Hearing Officer shall not be directly or indirectly conditioned upon the number of administrative citations or the amount of administrative fines upheld by the Hearing Officer.

D. Failure to file an appeal request in accordance with this section shall constitute a waiver of the responsible person’s right to contest any matters set forth in the administrative citation. [Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

1.10.080 Hardship waiver.
A. Any responsible person who requests a hearing to contest an administrative citation and who is financially unable to deposit the administrative fine may request a hardship waiver.

B. This request shall be filed with the hearing request. The request shall be accompanied by a sworn affidavit, and any other relevant supporting materials, demonstrating the responsible person’s inability to deposit the fine in advance of the hearing.

C. The City Manager or his or her designee shall decide within 10 days of receipt of the hardship waiver request whether or not to issue a hardship waiver. The decision shall be in writing, and shall be served upon the responsible person requesting the waiver. The decision shall be final.

D. If the City Manager or his or her designee decides that a hardship waiver is unwarranted, the responsible person shall deposit the full amount of the fine within 10 days of service of the written decision, or within 10 days from the date of the administrative citation, whichever is later. If the responsible person fails to deposit this fine before this due date, the City may disregard the hearing request, and any scheduled hearing shall be cancelled. [Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

1.10.090 Hearing procedure.
A. On the date and at the time and place set forth in the notice of hearing, the Hearing Officer shall conduct an orderly hearing and shall accept evidence on which persons commonly would rely in the conduct of their business affairs. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply.

B. The responsible person contesting the administrative citation shall have the opportunity to testify and to present evidence, including witnesses, concerning the alleged violation. Any other interested party, including without limitation the property or business owner, employees, or neighbors, may also present evidence. The Hearing Officer shall limit the evidence to that which is relevant to establishing or refuting the violation alleged in the administrative citation.

C. If the responsible person or any other interested person fails to attend the scheduled hearing, that person shall have waived any right to present evidence on the matter.

D. The administrative citation and any other reports submitted by the Enforcement Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the facts recited in those documents.

E. The Hearing Officer may take the matter under consideration, may continue the hearing, and may request additional information from the Enforcement Officer or from the responsible person.

F. On the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, the Hearing Officer shall determine whether to affirm or dismiss the administrative citation. The Hearing Officer may not reduce, waive, or conditionally reduce the fines established by the City.

G. The Hearing Officer shall make findings based on the record of the hearing, and shall issue a final written decision based on those findings. The written decision shall be served upon the responsible person along with notice regarding the right to further appeal.

H. If the Hearing Officer affirms the administrative citation, the City shall retain any fine deposited by the responsible person. If the Hearing Officer affirms the administrative citation and the fine has not yet been deposited because of an approved hardship waiver, the Hearing Officer shall specify in the written decision a payment schedule for the fine, including the date upon which the fine will be overdue. If the Hearing Officer dismisses the administrative citation, any fine deposited with the City shall be promptly refunded. [Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

1.10.100 Judicial review.
Any person aggrieved by an administrative decision of a Hearing Officer may obtain review of that decision by filing a petition for review in the Marin County Superior Court, according to the requirements of Government Code Section 53069.4. [Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

1.10.110 Administrative citation collection.
A. For any violation of the Sausalito Municipal Code for which no other specific penalty is established, the fine imposed by an administrative citation for that violation shall be $100.00 for a first violation; $200.00 for a second violation of the same provision of the Sausalito Municipal Code within a 12-month period; and $500.00 for each additional violation of that same provision within a 12-month period or such higher amount as may be authorized by California Government Code Section 36900(b).

B. For violations of the Sausalito Municipal Code for rental of a dwelling unit, accessory dwelling unit, bedroom, or room or rooms in a dwelling unit, for a period of less than 30 days, a specific penalty is established: $1,000 for a first violation, $2,000 for a second violation, and $5,000 for the third and subsequent violations.

C. Fines for administrative citations shall be payable directly to the City of Sausalito and are due immediately upon service of the administrative citation. Such fines constitute a debt owed to the City of Sausalito.

D. Payment of the fine associated with any administrative citation shall not excuse the violation, nor shall it bar other or further enforcement activity by the City.

E. Any fine paid for an administrative citation shall be refunded if it is determined after a hearing under this chapter that the violation charged in the administrative citation did not exist or occur.

F. If payment of a fine is not received by the City within 30 days of its due date, the fine is overdue unless a timely hearing request including an application for a hardship waiver has been filed according to SMC 1.10.080. If a hardship waiver application is denied, the fine is overdue unless the full amount is deposited within 10 days of service of the written decision denying the hardship waiver, or within 30 days from the date of the administrative citation, whichever is later. If a hardship waiver is granted, but the Hearing Officer affirms the administrative citation, the Hearing Officer shall set forth a payment schedule for the fine that shall specify the date on which the fine becomes overdue. In such case, the fine shall be overdue on that date, unless a timely appeal from the Hearing Officer’s determination is filed with the Marin County Superior Court. If any such appeal is dismissed, or if the decision of the Court affirms the administrative citation, the fine shall be overdue 10 days after service by the Court or by the City of notice of entry of judgment or of dismissal, or 20 days after entry of judgment or of dismissal, whichever is first. A late penalty equal to 50 percent of the total fine shall be assessed for any overdue fine.

G. If a fine is overdue, and if the violation of the Sausalito Municipal Code for which the fine was assessed occurred on or was a condition of real property, the outstanding fine and late penalty shall constitute a lien against that real property. The Enforcement Officer shall prepare and file with the City Clerk a report stating the amount due and owing.

The City may record notice of this lien after a hearing before the City Council to consider any protest or objection to the lien. The Enforcement Officer shall serve notice of the hearing upon the owner of record of the real property, based on the last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current. The notice of hearing shall include the time, date, and place of the hearing and the amount of the lien to be imposed, and shall be served according to SMC 1.10.060.

If the City Council determines that the lien should be imposed, the Enforcement Officer may cause notice of the lien to be recorded with the County Recorder. Once recorded, the lien shall have the force and effect and priority of a judgment lien governed by the provisions of Section 697.340 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and may be extended as provided in Sections 683.110 to 683.220, inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure.

H. The remedies set forth in this section are not exclusive. The City may collect past due fines for administrative citations, and penalties for late fines, by the use of the small claims court or by any other legal remedy. [Ord. 1242 § 1, 2016; Ord. 1174 § 1, 2004.]

The City Council declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other, purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

C. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes;

D. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting City sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 821 § 4, 1973.]

3.04.030 Operative date.
This chapter shall be operative on January 1, 1974. [Ord. 821 § 3, 1973.]

3.04.040 Contract with State.
Prior to the operative date, this City shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this City shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. [Ord. 821 § 5, 1973.]

3.04.050 Rate.
The rate of sales tax and use tax imposed by this chapter shall be one percent. [Ord. 821 § 2, 1973.]

For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is imposed upon all retailers in the City at the rate stated in SMC 3.04.050 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in this City on and after the operative date. [Ord. 821 § 6, 1973.]

3.04.070 Place of sale designated.
For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-State destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-State destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this City shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however, shall not be made when the word “State” is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California; the substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the City, or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State of California, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the State under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the State under the provisions of that code; the substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word “State” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

3.04.120 Permit not required when.
If a seller’s permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional seller’s permit shall not be required by this chapter. [Ord. 821 § 11, 1973.]

3.04.130 Exclusions and exemptions.

C.

3.06.010 Title.
This chapter shall be known as the 2014 transactions and use tax (the “chapter”). The City of Sausalito hereinafter shall be referred to as the “City.” This chapter shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of the City. [Ord. 1288 § 2, 2014.]

3.06.030 Purpose.
The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and the provisions hereof should be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A. To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 Division 2 which authorizes the City to adopt the ordinance codified in this chapter which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

B. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.

D. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 1288 § 2, 2014.]

3.06.040 Contract with State.
Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax chapter; provided, that if the City shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract. [Ord. 1288 § 2, 2014.]

3.06.050 Transactions tax rate.
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax hereby is imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the City at the rate of one-half of one percent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. [Ord. 1288 § 2, 2014.]

3.06.060 Place of sale.
For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-State destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-State destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the State sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. [Ord. 1288 § 2, 2014.]

3.06.070 Use tax rate.
An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the City of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after the operative date of the ordinance codified in this chapter for storage, use, or other consumption in said territory at the rate of one-half of one percent of the sales price of the property.

Commencing in fiscal year 1974-75, and every fiscal year thereafter, the preliminary budget shall allocate moneys for depreciation on specific pieces of equipment in the appropriate operating funds of the City for approval by the Council. Annually, the budgeted moneys approved by the Council for capital equipment depreciation shall be recorded as expenditures against the appropriate budgetary depreciation accounts in the various operating funds and transferred to the specific reserve account for each piece of equipment in the capital equipment replacement fund. In the fiscal year of replacement, the piece of equipment shall be clearly shown in the preliminary budget as a proposed appropriation from the capital equipment replacement fund. If the Council approves the proposed replacement, the expenditure shall be charged against the specific reserve account for the piece of equipment in the capital equipment replacement fund. In the event there are not sufficient moneys in the reserve account to cover the total expenditure for replacement, an additional appropriation shall be required in the appropriate budgetary account in the applicable operating fund and transferred to the specific reserve account for the piece of equipment to cover the expenditure for replacement. In the event there is a surplus of moneys in the reserve account after charging the expenditures for replacement, these moneys shall remain in the reserve account. In the event it is decided not to replace a piece of equipment that has been depreciated with any other piece of equipment, moneys in the reserve account shall be distributed, allocated and/or transferred as determined by resolution of the City Council. In the event it is determined the estimated replacement cost for a piece of equipment that has not been depreciated exceeds $5,000, depreciation shall commence on that piece of equipment in the fiscal year following that determination. [Ord. 1011 § 4, 1984; Ord. 836 § 4, 1975.]

3.28.050 Determination of amount of money to be budgeted for depreciation.
The amount of money to be budgeted for depreciation shall be determined in the following manner. During budget preparations, the fiscal year of replacement for each piece of equipment shall be reevaluated and changed if necessary. A revised estimated replacement cost shall be determined. The amount to be budgeted for depreciation shall be calculated by subtracting the amount that will be accumulated in the specific reserve account for the piece of equipment on July 1st of the budget year from the revised estimated replacement cost. Based on the revised fiscal year of replacement, this figure shall be divided by the remaining years of depreciation. If the resulting budget figure for depreciation results in cents, any odd figure shall be included in the depreciation for the budget year. [Ord. 836 § 5, 1975.]

The purpose of this chapter is to establish an efficient procedure for the purchase of supplies, equipment, and services, and to establish a procedure for performing or contracting for the construction of public works consistent with State law. These procedures are intended to allow the City to obtain the best professional services, to acquire quality supplies, general services and equipment, to construct public works at the lowest possible cost commensurate with quality needed, and to exercise positive financial control over purchases and also to define authority for the purchasing function. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

In such case, the following procedures shall be followed:

A. Solicitation of Bids.

Unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to the return of bid security within 60 days of the date of the award. However, the lowest responsive and responsible bidder shall forfeit all or part of its bid security, as may be determined by the City Council, upon the bidder’s refusal or failure to execute the contract within 10 days after the date of the award of the contract. On the refusal or failure of the lowest responsive and responsible bidder to execute the contract, the Council may award the contract to the next lowest responsible bidder.

E. Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the City Clerk’s Office and shall be identified as to bidder, project, and “Bid” on the envelope. Bids shall be opened by City staff in public at the time and place stated in the notice inviting bids. A written record and tabulation shall be made at that time of all bids received, and shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of time designated in the City’s records retention policy.

F. Bid Evaluation Procedures. All bids shall be analyzed by the Purchasing Officer or designee and the responsible department for compliance with bid specifications.

G. Rejection of Bids. If the City Council determines that bids are excessively high or that specifications were unclear, or if no bids are received, the Council may reject all bids presented and use whatever method it deems appropriate, such as rebid, abandon acquisition, or negotiating a contract.

H. Award of Contracts. Contracts shall be awarded by the Council to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid fulfills the purpose intended according to criteria designated in the solicitation, provided the award amount is within the unencumbered appropriation for that item. The Council may waive any minor bid irregularities.

I. Tie Bids.

J. Performance Bonds. The City may require a performance bond in such amount as it shall find reasonably necessary to protect the public interest. If the City requires a performance bond, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids. [Ord. 1198 § 6, 2009; Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

B. Sole Source Purchases. Commodities or services that can be obtained from only one vendor or one distributor authorized to sell in this area are exempt from the competitive bidding requirements in SMC 3.30.150 and are deemed sole source purchases.

However, the City Council’s consent shall be required prior to and for the joining of a “piggy-back” purchase or cooperative purchase for a purchase of $25,000 or more. [Ord. 1198 § 8, 2009; Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

3.30.210 Recycled supply products specification.
If in procuring supplies a recycled product can achieve the necessary City performance standard, and if such recycled product is readily available, specifications should, if economically feasible, require products made with recycled materials be bid. If the department head determines that (A) a recycled product lacks performance capabilities or needed quality levels, or (B) a sufficient amount of such recycled or reusable product is not currently available in the market, then a reduced percentage can be required, or the supply specification can be limited to nonrecycled or virgin materials. When recycled products are required, reasonable efforts shall be made to label the products as containing recycled materials. As used in this section, “recycled products” does not mean used products, but is limited to new products made with materials which have been recycled. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

3.30.220 Emergencies.
Bidding procedures may be dispensed with in the case of an emergency. The City Council delegates to the City Manager the authority to declare a public emergency subject to confirmation by the City Council at its next meeting for any purchase of $15,000 or more. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

The purchasing officer or designee, at his or her discretion, may require such reasonable chemical and physical tests of samples of supplies and equipment as he or she deems necessary to determine the quality in conformance with those specifications. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

3.30.240 Personal purchases not authorized.
No goods or services for personal use or pleasure may be purchased with City funds. The City reserves the right to charge back the responsible party for all costs determined to be personally motivated. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

If all bids received are in excess of $100,000, or in the amount as automatically increased pursuant to SMC 3.30.310(D), the City Council may, by passage of a resolution by a four-fifths vote, award the contract up to $110,000, or 110 percent of the increased amount, to the lowest responsible bidder if it determines the cost estimate of the City was reasonable. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

3.30.340 Formal bidding procedures.
For those projects which qualify under SMC 3.30.310(C) for formal bidding, the procedures established in the California Public Contract Code, or successor statute, shall be used. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

Article IV. Professional or Special Services

3.30.500 Award of professional or special service contracts based upon competence.
In contracting for those professional and special services as defined in SMC 3.30.020, such contracts should only be awarded to firms or persons who have demonstrated an adequate level of experience, competence, staffing and other professional qualifications necessary for more than a satisfactory performance of the services required. Once the department requesting the service has determined a firm has an adequate level of competence, the cost of the service may be considered. However, the lowest cost may not be the sole factor in deciding which firm or who shall be awarded the contract. It may be in the City’s best interest to award the contract to a higher priced contractor based on the scope of services available, unique skills, staffing levels, timing, prior experience, past working relationship and other factors required by the department or proposed by that contractor. The information needed for determining that level of competence, other qualifications and the procedure for selecting such services shall be determined by each City department responsible for recommending the professional or special service contract. [Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

3.30.510 Requests for proposals/qualifications.
A. Contracting for professional or special services is decentralized and shall be the responsibility of the department head requesting the service.

B. The acquiring of professional or special services less than $25,000 shall be procured through negotiated contract and in general should include requests for proposals from at least three firms whenever practical.

C. The acquiring of professional or special services greater than $5,000 and less than $25,000 shall be procured through negotiated contract and in general should include requests for proposals from at least three firms whenever practical.

D. Contracts for professional or special services estimated to cost more than $25,000 must be approved by a resolution of the City Council. Recommendation for award should be pursuant to the following guidelines and based on competitive proposals; however, it is recognized that the City’s need for professional or special services will vary from situation to situation, and accordingly, flexibility will be provided in determining the appropriate evaluation and selection process to be used in each specific circumstance.

1. The City Council Finance Committee should generally approve request for proposal (RFP) documents before they are issued.

2. In the event that the timely evaluation and selection of a consultant precludes City Council Finance Committee approval of the RFP before it is issued, the RFP may be approved by the City Manager for issuance by the department head. The RFP will be provided to the Finance Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

3. Neither total cost nor hourly rates are the sole criterion in selecting a provider of professional or special services. Proposals will be evaluated based on a combination of factors that result in the best value to the City, including but not limited to:

a. Understanding of the work required by the City;

b. Quality and responsiveness of the proposal;

c. Demonstrated competence and professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the work required by the City;

d. Recent relevant experience in successfully performing similar services to similar clients;

e. Proposed methodology for completing the work;

f. References;

g. Background and related experience of the specific individuals to be assigned to the project;

h. Proposed compensation, rates and the basis of the proposed compensation (e.g., lump sum, time and expenses, reimbursable against a budget, or time and expenses not to exceed, cost plus fixed fee, etc.);

i. Proposed level of effort and schedule;

j. Commitment regarding the continuity and level of involvement of key personnel.

4. If it is determined that it is in the best interest of the City for services to be provided by a specific consultant – with contract terms, work scope and compensation to be determined based on direct negotiations – contract award will be made by the Council. [Ord. 1198 § 11, 2009; Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

3.30.520 Contracting authority.
The City Manager may approve professional service contracts up to and including $25,000. The City Council shall approve professional or special service contracts greater than $25,000. [Ord. 1198 § 12, 2009; Ord. 1176C § 1(Exh. A), 2005.]

This chapter is enacted under the police power of the City and under California Government Code Section 66000 et seq. [Ord. 1166 § 1, 2003.]

3.36.020 Findings.
Based upon the “City Engineer’s Report on Establishment of a New Fee to Mitigate the Impact of Construction Traffic on Public Streets,” the staff report, oral presentations and all other evidence presented to the City Council, the City Council finds and determines as follows:

A. Construction vehicles have a disproportionate impact on the condition of the City’s roads and streets due to the fact that they are far heavier than other types of vehicles.

B. The purpose of this chapter and the fee established hereby is to assist the City in funding the cost of repairs to City roads caused by increased wear and damage due to construction activity and to offset the cost associated with an increased rate of deterioration of the City’s road system caused by the impacts of new construction within the City.

C. In the absence of this program imposing a fair share construction traffic road fee upon new construction, existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fully fund the roadway improvements necessary to maintain the City’s roadways in their current condition.

D. The fees generated pursuant to this chapter will be utilized to implement the preventive maintenance and rehabilitation treatments identified in the City’s pavement maintenance system program.

E. New construction in the City generates vehicle trips throughout the City on the existing streets and roadways. This construction traffic has greater wheel loading and therefore has greater impact on the City’s roads. The fee will be utilized to repair the damage to the City’s streets resulting in part from the construction traffic and to maintain such streets.

F. All types of projects in the City will directly benefit from the road way improvements and maintenance funded by the construction traffic roadway fee. [Ord. 1166 § 1, 2003.]

3.36.030 Application.
This chapter shall apply to construction traffic road fees charged as a condition of development to defray the cost of road repairs related to damage caused by construction vehicles. [Ord. 1166 § 1, 2003.]

3.36.050 Construction traffic road fees.

D. Creation of Special Fund. The City shall deposit fees collected under this chapter in a special fund, the construction traffic road fee fund.

D. Hearing. The City Manager shall serve as the hearing officer, who shall set the time and place for the hearing, serve notice on the parties, conduct the hearing, prepare written findings of fact and a written decision on the matter, and shall preserve the complete administrative record of the proceedings. The City Manager shall consider relevant evidence presented by the appellant and the City employees.

E. Decision. The decision of the City Manager is final and may not be further appealed; it is reviewable by a court under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. [Ord. 1166 § 1, 2003.]

3.36.070 Payment under protest.

B. The City Council shall review the information provided in the report at a noticed public hearing held not less than 15 days after the report is made available to the public.

Whenever the City Clerk shall determine that there is a prima facie showing of a violation of this chapter by an identifiable person or committee, the City Clerk may issue a notice of violation to that person or committee. The notice of violation shall advise that the City Clerk has determined there is probable cause to find that the identified person or committee has violated this chapter, and shall set forth a brief description of the facts constituting the violation. The notice of violation shall also disclose the amount of the penalty established for the violation of this chapter, and shall advise that the penalty shall be imposed by the City unless the notice recipient submits a written request for hearing to the City Clerk within seven calendar days after the date of the notice. The written request for hearing shall set forth all grounds upon which the person or committee requesting the hearing contends that this chapter has not been violated or that the specified penalty should not be imposed by the City.

2. If no hearing is requested within the time provided herein, the City Clerk shall have the authority to impose the penalty specified in the notice of violation, and shall mail a notice of penalty to the violator. Such penalty shall be due and payable within 30 days after the date of the notice of penalty.

3. Within two business days after receipt of a written request for hearing under this section, the City Clerk, or his or her designee, shall mail to the accused violator and to the complainant(s), if any, a written notice of hearing setting forth the date and time of a hearing at which the accused violator and complainant(s) may present oral or written evidence concerning the alleged violation or the penalty proposed. Such hearing shall be set no earlier than five business days after the date of the notice of hearing.

4. A hearing requested pursuant to this section shall be held by a hearing officer chosen from a panel of volunteers appointed by the City Attorney for such purpose pursuant to guidelines to be established by resolution of the City Council. At such hearing, the hearing officer shall consider all the evidence presented by the City Clerk, the accused violator and the complainant(s), if any, concerning the alleged violation, and may consider any mitigating circumstances, including but not limited to efforts made to correct any violation. Upon conclusion of the hearing or within five business days thereafter, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision setting forth findings as to whether the accused has violated this chapter, and imposing a specific penalty for any violations found. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may obtain review of the decision by filing a notice of appeal with the Marin County courts in accordance with the timelines and provisions set forth in California Government Code Section 53069.4.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the City Clerk shall not be required to issue a notice of violation for any alleged violation of this chapter, nor shall the City in any instance be required to take any enforcement action pursuant to this chapter.

D. In any case where the City Clerk determines that he or she may have a conflict of interest in the enforcement of this chapter, the City Clerk may delegate such enforcement to independent counsel to be selected by the City Clerk in consultation with the City Attorney. [Ord. 1202 § 2, 2010.]

5.04.020 Definitions.
As used in this chapter:

A. “Business” includes professions, trades, and occupations and all and every kind of calling whether or not carried on for profit. This includes companies and individuals with a fictitious business name and/or a sales tax resale permit issued for a business location in the City of Sausalito.

Included in “gross receipts” shall be all receipts, cash, credits, and property of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the property sold, the cost of materials used, labor or service costs, interest paid or payable, or losses or other expenses whatsoever. Excluded from “gross receipts” shall be the following:

1. Cash discounts allowed and taken on sales;

2. Credit allowed on property accepted as part of the purchase price and which property may later be sold;

3. Any tax required by law to be included in or added to the purchase price and collected from the consumer or purchaser;

4. Such part of the sale price of property returned by purchasers upon rescission of the contract of sale as is refunded either in cash or by credit;

5. Amounts collected for others where the business is acting as an agent or trustee to the extent that such amounts are paid to those for whom collected, provided the agent or trustee has furnished the Collector with the names and addresses of the others and the amounts paid to them;

6. Receipts of refundable deposits, except that refundable deposits forfeited and taken into income of the business shall not be excluded;

7. As to a real estate agent or broker, business opportunity broker, yacht broker or other types of brokers, the sales price of real estate, business, yachts or other commodities sold for the account of others except that portion which represents commission or other income to the agent or broker;

8. As to a retail gasoline dealer, a portion of his receipts from the sale of motor vehicle fuels equal to the motor vehicle fuel license tax imposed by and previously paid under the provisions of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State;

The foregoing definitions shall not be deemed to exclude any transaction which is or which, in effect, results in a sale within the contemplation of law.

G. “Sworn statement” means an affidavit sworn to before a person authorized to take oaths, or a declaration or certification made under penalty of perjury. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 1, 1968.]

5.04.030 License and tax payment required.
There are imposed upon all businesses, trades, professions, callings and occupations carried on, conducted or transacted in the City the license taxes in the amounts hereinafter prescribed. It is unlawful for any person to conduct, transact or carry on any business, trade, profession, calling or occupation in the City without first having procured a license from the City to do so and paying the tax hereinafter prescribed or without complying with any and all applicable provisions of this chapter.

This section shall not be construed to require any person to obtain a license prior to doing business within the City if such requirement conflicts with applicable statutes of the United States or of the State. Persons not so required to obtain a license prior to doing business within the City nevertheless shall be liable for payment of the tax imposed by this chapter. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 4, 1968.]

5.04.035 Payment not a license.
No license or payment of tax required by this chapter shall be construed as authorizing any person to conduct an illegal business or a legal business in an illegal manner. The business license issued pursuant to the provisions of this title constitutes a receipt for the license tax paid and shall have no other legal effect. A business license is a requirement, not a permit, to conduct, manage or carry on any business activity within the City. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018.]

5.04.040 Effect of chapter on other ordinances.
Persons required to pay a license tax for transacting and carrying on any business under this chapter shall not be relieved from the payment of any license tax for the privilege of doing such business required under any other ordinance of the City and shall remain subject to the regulatory provisions of other ordinances. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 3, 1968.]

5.04.050 Branch establishments or separate locations.
A separate license must be obtained for each branch establishment or location of the business transacted and carried on and for each separate type of business at the same location, and each license shall authorize the licensee to transact and carry on only the business licensed thereby at the location or in the manner designated in such license; provided, that warehouses and distributing plants used in connection with and incidental to a business licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to be separate places of business or branches. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 5, 1968.]

5.04.060 Evidence of doing business described.
When any person shall by use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone book, or newspapers advertise, hold out, or represent that he or she is in business in the City, or when any person holds an active license or permit issued by a governmental agency indicating that he or she is in business in the City, and such person fails to deny by a sworn statement given to the Collector that he or she is conducting a business in the City, after being requested to do so by the Collector, then these facts shall be considered prima facie evidence that he or she is conducting a business in the City. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 6, 1968.]

5.04.070 Constitutional apportionment.
None of the license taxes provided for by this chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of California.

In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he or she may apply to the Collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his or her method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the Collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The Collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the Collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the Collector determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant’s business in the City or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor; provided, that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this chapter. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 7, 1968.]

5.04.080 Exemptions.
A. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the State from the payment of such taxes as are herein prescribed.

B. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed or construed to apply to any public utility which pays to the City any tax or fee under a franchise granted by the City.

C. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a license tax to conduct, manage, or carry on any business occupation or activity from any institution or organization which is conducted, managed or carried on wholly for the benefit of charitable purposes from which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly, by an individual, firm, or corporation. Nor shall any license tax be required for the conducting of any entertainment, dance, concert, exhibition, or lecture on scientific, historical, literary, religious or moral subjects whenever the receipts are to be appropriated for the purpose for which such organization was formed and from which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly, by an individual, firm, or corporation.

D. Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to this section shall file a sworn statement with the Collector stating the facts upon which exemption is claimed, and, in the absence of such statement substantiating the claim, such person shall be liable for the payment of the taxes imposed by this chapter.

E. The Collector shall, upon a proper showing contained in the sworn statement, issue a license to such person claiming exemption under this section without payment to the City of the license tax required by this chapter.

F. The Collector, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for hearing to a licensee, may revoke any license granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon information that the licensee is not entitled to the exemption as provided herein.

G. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a business license tax to any business created under the provisions of Division 2, Nonprofit Corporation Law, of Title 1, Corporations, of the Corporations Code of the State of California or which constitutes an “educational institution” as that term is defined at Section 10251 of the California Corporations Code. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 1106 § 1, 1995; Ord. 716 § 8, 1968.]

5.04.090 License – Contents.
A. Every person required to have a license under the provisions of this chapter shall make application as hereinafter prescribed for the same to the Collector of the City, and, upon the payment of the prescribed license tax, the Collector shall issue to such person a license which shall contain the following information:

1. The name of the person to whom the license is issued;

2. The business licensed;

3. The place where such business is to be transacted and carried on;

4. The date of the expiration of such license; and

5. Such other information as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

B. Whenever the tax imposed under the provisions of this chapter is measured by the number of vehicles, devices, machines, or other pieces of equipment used, or whenever the license tax is measured by the gross receipts from the operation of such items, the Collector shall issue only one license; provided, that he may issue for each tax period for which the license tax has been paid one identification sticker, tag, plate, or symbol for each item included in the measure of the tax or used in a business where the tax is measured by the gross receipts from such items. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 9, 1968.]

5.04.100 License – Application requirements for first license or new business.
A. Upon a person making application for the first license to be issued hereunder or for a newly established business, such person shall furnish to the Collector a sworn statement, upon a form provided by the Collector, setting forth the following information:

1. The exact nature or kind of business for which a license is requested;

2. The place where such business is to be carried on, and, if the same is not to be carried on at any permanent place of business, the places of residence of the owners of the same;

3. In the event that application is made for the issuance of a license to a person doing business under a fictitious name, the application shall set forth the names and places of residence of those owning such business;

4. In the event that application is made for the issuance of a license to a corporation or a partnership, the application shall set forth the names and places of residence of the officers or partners thereof;

5. In all cases where the amount of license tax to be paid is measured by gross receipts, the application shall set forth such information as may be therein required and as may be necessary to determine the amount of the license tax to be paid by the applicant;

6. Any further information which the Collector may require to enable him to issue the type of license applied for.

B. If the amount of the license tax to be paid by the applicant is measured by gross receipts and the license is for an established business, the license tax shall be based on gross receipts for the previous calendar year if such business was in operation for the entire previous calendar year. If the license is for an established business which was in operation for only a portion of the previous calendar year, the license tax shall be based on a projection of the receipts for the previous year over a full year’s operation. If the license is for a business operating in the City for the first time, the license tax shall be based on the applicant’s estimate of the gross receipts for the first year of operation; provided, however, the amount of the license tax so determined shall be tentative only, and such person shall, within 30 days after the expiration of the period for which such license was issued, furnish the Collector with a sworn statement, upon a form furnished by the Collector, showing the gross receipts during the period of such license, and the license tax for such period shall be finally ascertained and paid in the manner provided by this chapter for the ascertaining and paying of renewal license taxes for other businesses, after deducting from the payment found to be due the amount paid at the time such first license was issued.

C. The Collector shall not issue to any such person another license for the same or any other business, until such person shall have furnished to him the sworn statement and paid the license tax as herein required. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 10, 1968.]

5.04.110 License – Renewal procedure.
In all cases, the applicant for the renewal of a license shall submit to the Collector for his guidance in ascertaining the amount of the license tax to be paid by the applicant a sworn statement, upon a form to be provided by the Collector, setting forth such information concerning the applicant’s business during the preceding year as may be required by the Collector to enable him to ascertain the amount of the license tax to be paid by such applicant pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 11, 1968.]

5.04.120 Statement filing and recordkeeping requirements.
No statements submitted by the applicant shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth therein, nor shall the filing of the same preclude the City from collecting by appropriate action such sum as is actually due and payable under this chapter. Such statement and each of the several items therein contained shall be subject to audit and verification by the Collector, his deputies, or authorized employees or representatives of the City, who are authorized to examine, audit, and inspect such books and records of any licensee or applicant for license, as may be necessary in their judgment to verify or ascertain the amount of license fee due.

All persons subject to the provisions of this chapter shall keep complete records of business transactions, including sales, receipts, purchases, and other expenditures, and shall retain all such records for examination by the Collector. Such records shall be maintained for a period of at least three years. No person required to keep records under this section shall refuse to allow authorized representatives of the Collector to examine such records at reasonable times and places. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 12, 1968.]

It is unlawful for the Collector or any person having an administrative duty under the provisions of this chapter to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an investigation of records and equipment of any person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth in any statement or application, or to permit any statement or application, or copy of either, or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person; provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent:

A. The disclosure to, or the examination of records and equipment by, another City official, employee, or agent for collection of taxes for the sole purpose of administering or enforcing any provisions of this chapter, or collecting taxes imposed under this chapter;

B. The disclosure of information to, or the examination of records by, Federal or State officials, or the tax officials of another city or county, or city and county, if a reciprocal arrangement exists, or to a grand jury or court of law, upon subpoena;

C. The disclosure of information and results of examination of records of particular taxpayers, or relating to particular taxpayers, to a court of law in a proceeding brought to determine the existence or amount of any license tax liability of the particular taxpayers to the City;

D. The disclosure, after the filing of a written request to that effect, to the taxpayer himself, or to his successors, receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, of information as to the items included in the measure of any paid tax, any unpaid tax or amounts of tax required to be collected, interest and penalties; further provided, however, that the City Attorney approves each such disclosure and that the Collector may refuse to make any disclosure referred to in this subsection when in his opinion the public interest would suffer thereby;

E. The disclosure of the names and addresses of persons to whom licenses have been issued, and the general type or nature of their business;

F. The disclosure by way of public meeting or otherwise of such information as may be necessary to the City Council in order to permit it to be fully advised as to the facts when a taxpayer files a claim for refund of license taxes, or submits an offer of compromise with regard to a claim asserted against him by the City for license taxes, or when acting upon any other matter;

G. The disclosure of general statistics regarding taxes collected or business done in the City. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 13, 1968.]

5.04.140 Failure to file statement or corrected statement.
A. If any person fails to file any required statement within the time prescribed, or if after demand therefor made by the Collector he fails to file a corrected statement, or if any person subject to the tax imposed by this chapter fails to apply for a license, the Collector may determine the amount of license tax due from such person by means of such information as he may be able to obtain.

B. If the Collector is not satisfied with the information supplied in statements or applications filed, he may determine the amount of any license tax due by means of any information he may be able to obtain.

C. If such a determination is made the Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States Post Office at Sausalito, California, postage prepaid, addressed to the person so assessed at his last known address. Such person may, within 15 days after the mailing or serving of such notice, make application in writing to the Collector for a hearing on the amount of the license tax. If such application is made, the Collector shall give such person reasonable notice of the time and place the Collector will hear and examine any additional evidence such person may wish to present relating to such assessment of taxes. The Collector shall notify such person of the Collector’s findings with regard to such evidence and the assessment of taxes. [Ord. 1266A § 1, 2018; Ord. 716 § 14, 1968.]

5.04.150 Appeal procedure.

6.04.122 Hearings.
A. The Administrative Hearing Officer selected by the County Administrator or designee is authorized to conduct hearings in all cases authorized by the provisions of this chapter. This shall include, but not be limited to, all permit denials, permit revocations or refusals to renew permits authorized under this chapter. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to the animal owner/guardian, permittee or permittee applicant at least 10 days prior to the date set for hearing, unless the animal owner/guardian, permittee or permittee applicant expressly requests, in writing, that the hearing be set for an earlier date, and the Animal Services Agency agrees to do so. Service of the notice shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.04.190 of the County Code. If the owner/guardian of the affected animal, permittee or permittee applicant fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing shall nevertheless proceed, and an appropriate order shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

B. The Administrative Hearing Officer shall have the ability to impose administrative hearing fees authorized under a fee ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body under whose authority the hearing has been undertaken. The Administrative Hearing Officer may impose the fees based upon the complainant’s, or business owner’s or animal owner/guardian’s, culpability for causing administrative expenses to the Animal Services Agency’s program. At the administrative hearing, the hearing fee shall be in lieu of the imposition of any applicable statutory fine. In a de novo appeal to the Superior Court, both administrative expense fees as well as statutory penalties may be imposed upon the animal owner/guardian as deemed appropriate. Criminal restitution, damages and/or injury awards are the domain of the Superior Courts and are not available by way of the administrative hearing process. In any hearings other than ones involving the determination of the status of a potentially dangerous animal or vicious animal, the decisions of the Hearing Officer shall be final but subject to review by the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of CCP Section 1094.5. De novo appeal of Hearing Officer decisions to the Superior Court is only available in the case of potentially dangerous animal or vicious animal hearings.

C. If the animal owner/guardian does not appeal the orders of the Hearing Officer in a potentially dangerous or vicious animal case to the Superior Court within the time period prescribed in this chapter, the Hearing Officer’s orders shall be binding. In all other administrative hearings, the decisions of the Hearing Officer are final without further appeal to the Superior Court. Failure to abide by the Hearing Officer’s orders shall, upon petition by the Animal Services Agency, subject the animal owner/guardian (or commercial animal establishment-related licensee or other permittees/licensees) to attend a noticed sanctions hearing where further regulatory actions to protect the public health and safety may be considered and imposed. Notice requirements shall be the same as in the case of the initial hearing before the Hearing Officer. (See subsection A of this section.) The sanctions that may be imposed include any reasonable regulatory actions to preserve public health and safety including, but not limited to, the destruction of the animal (which order is subject to de novo review) or, in the case of a permit or license, loss of the permit or license. Lesser sanctions may be imposed provided the health and safety of the public are not unreasonably placed at risk. Sanctions hearings shall be recorded or reported, and shall be final. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to impose additional administrative fees authorized under a fee ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body under whose authority the hearing has been undertaken for the expenses related to the sanctions hearing. The orders from such sanctions hearings shall be subject to review by the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of CCP Section 1094.5.

D. Any owner/guardian failing to abide by the final orders of the Hearing Officer within the period allowed within the orders or under law shall pay a civil administrative penalty in the amount of $500.00. The civil administrative penalty may be waived where failure to perform the required order(s) is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the control of the dog owner/guardian which shall be determined by the Hearing Officer. Any person dissatisfied with a hearing determination denying waiver of the civil administrative penalty may petition for review by the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of CCP Section 1094.5. [Ord. 1190 § 1, 2008; Ord. 1171 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1091 § 4, 1993.]

It is unlawful for the owner/guardian or person having control of any dog to suffer or permit the same to run upon the lands of another whereon livestock or domestic fowl are kept, without the consent of the owner or person entitled to the use or possession of such lands. [Ord. 1190 § 1, 2008; Ord. 1171 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1076 § 2, 1992; Ord. 881 § 5.1, 1975.]

6.04.179 Prohibition of habitual animal noise which unreasonably disturbs the peace.
A. Subject to the provisions of subsections B, C, D and E of this section, it is unlawful for any person to suffer or permit any dog, cat, fowl, or other animal to habitually bark, yelp, howl or create noise in such a manner which unreasonably disturbs the peace of any person(s).

B. Any person who shall keep or permit to remain on any premises an animal which disturbs the peace of any person in the manner set forth in subsection A of this section shall be guilty of an infraction for a first citable offense (and under subsection E of this section be subject to fines pursuant to Marin County Code Section 1.05.030) and for a subsequent second citable offense of a misdemeanor as provided in SMC 6.04.260(B). Any person found in violation of this subsection for a third or additional citable offense shall be guilty of a misdemeanor under SMC 6.04.260(B). An animal kennel regulated by a use permit under the provisions of the Marin County Code shall not be subject to the provisions of this section. This section shall not apply to customary animal noises of livestock, horses or other animals kept for agricultural activities in areas including but not limited to farms, ranches and stables that are zoned or legally permitted for such purposes.

C. Except as otherwise provided in subsection D of this section, where the animal owner/guardian is present and available at a household the police will notify the keeper of the offending animal of the noise violation and direct that such violation be abated. If the police receive a second complaint from any person within 30 days of the notice of complaint of an additional violation by the animal, then the police may issue a citation provided there is probable cause to believe the noise has been continuous for one-half an hour or more. If an animal creates noise, but not to the extent of a half hour of continuous noise, and the owner/guardian is not present at home, the police shall issue a written notice of complaint upon a first complaint that informs the owner/guardian that a further violation within 30 days of the notice of complaint may result in the issuance of a citation. Written notice of complaint shall be sufficient by securely posting the notice of the complaint upon the door of the household where the animal is kept. If the police receive a second complaint from any person within 30 days of the notice of complaint of an additional violation by the animal, then the police may issue a citation provided there is probable cause to believe the noise has been continuous for one-half an hour or more. Whenever possible, the police may recommend the services of County mediation to the complainant and the keeper of the animal as a means of resolving the animal nuisance noise. Mediation is voluntary and both parties must agree in writing within 10 business days of the complaint or citation. Mediation must then be concluded within 30 business days of the agreement to mediate. If mediation is refused by either party or is unsuccessful at the end of the 30 business days, then the matter shall proceed as if it were never referred to mediation.

D. If the animal owner/guardian of the offending animal is unavailable the police may issue a citation with a first complaint if it is determined by the police after investigation of the complaint and interview of the complainant that the noise created by the animal has persisted for one-half hour or more and cannot be abated or quieted so that it continues to disturb the peace of the complaining person(s). If the noise created by the animal can be abated or quieted so that it does not continue to disturb the peace, such abatement or quieting shall be done and the police shall issue a written notice of complaint upon a first complaint that informs the owner/guardian that a further violation within 30 days of the notice of complaint may result in the issuance of a citation. Written notice of complaint shall be sufficient by securely posting the notice of the complaint upon the door of the household where the animal is kept. If the police receive a second complaint from any person within 30 days of the notice of complaint of an additional violation by the animal, then the police may issue a citation provided there is probable cause to believe the noise has been continuous for one-half an hour or more. The police may in addition make a referral to animal services so an investigation may ensue as to whether the animal should be taken into protective custody. The animal may be taken into protective custody by animal services for animal owner/guardian abuse, neglect, or any other grounds within their authority. An animal placed under protective custody under this section may be redeemed by the owner/guardian provided there is presented to the Animal Services Agency proof of the owner/guardian’s identity and any required license certificate or license tag or other satisfactory proof of owner/guardianship and by paying the charges referenced under SMC 6.04.150 and the fees that may be established by separate ordinance of the Board of Supervisors in reference thereto.

E. The owner/guardian of an animal taken into protective custody under this section shall be entitled to a hearing conducted by a Hearing Officer designated by the County Administrator or his/her designee pursuant to the provisions of SMC 6.04.122. The hearing shall be conducted for the purpose of determining whether the taking of the animal into protective custody was proper and whether the protective custody should continue. The hearing shall be held within 10 business days following the taking of the animal into custody provided such owner/guardian files a written request for a hearing with the police within five business days following written notice. Unless the Hearing Officer otherwise determines, the owner/guardian is liable for all charges related to such taking of the animal into protective custody. [Ord. 1190 § 1, 2008; Ord. 1171 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1109 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1091 § 6, 1993.]

3. Prior to commencement of a potentially dangerous dog hearing, and if the allegations of the petition indicate that the dog is potentially dangerous as defined under subsection B of this section, the County Administrator or his/her designee may offer in writing mediation services as an alternative to a hearing provided both the complainant and the owner/guardian agree in writing to mediation. Mediation must be concluded within 30 days of the offer to mediate. If mediation is refused or is unsuccessful, then the matter shall be referred to a hearing under this subsection.

4. The County Administrator or his/her designee shall designate a Hearing Officer from a panel of up to five persons whose membership shall be designated by the Board of Supervisors.

Therefore, no building permit shall be issued unless written evidence is submitted to the Building Official demonstrating to the City’s satisfaction that adequate water, sewage and other utility service will be available upon completion of the building or structure. Such service shall not be deemed adequate unless it will permit the use of the building or structure for its designed purpose in a manner which will not constitute a hazard to health, safety or the public welfare. The required evidence shall consist of utility company permits or a statement of the utility company that adequate utility service will be provided when the building or structure is completed, but if the applicant proposes to provide any utility service from a source other than an existing public utility, other evidence satisfactory to the City shall be submitted indicating that the alternate utility source is adequate and complies with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations.

8.40.110 Amendments made to the 2016 California Fire Code, 2015 International Fire Code and 2015 International Wildland-Urban Interface Code.
A. The City Council of the City of Sausalito hereby finds that local conditions have an adverse effect on the prevention of (A) major loss fires, (B) major earthquake damage, and (C) the potential for life and property loss, making necessary changes or modifications to the 2015 International Fire Code, 2016 California Fire Code and the 2016 California Building Standards Code in order to provide a reasonable degree of property security and fire and life safety in this fire district.

Specifically, the City Council of the City of Sausalito finds the following local conditions make more stringent standards a necessity:

1. Climatic.

a. Precipitation. Precipitation ranges from 15 to 42 inches per year with an average of approximately 25 inches per year. Approximately 90 percent falls during the months of November through April and 10 percent from May through October.

b. Relative Humidity. Humidity generally ranges from 50 percent during daytime to 86 percent at night. It drops to 20 percent during the summer months and occasionally drops lower.

c. Temperatures. Temperatures have been recorded as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Average summer highs are in the 78-degree to 85-degree range.

d. Winds. Prevailing winds are from the northwest. However, winds are experienced from virtually every direction at one time or another. Velocities are generally in the five- to 15-mile-per-hour range, gusting to 30 miles per hour, particularly during the summer months. Strong gale-force ocean winds up to 50 miles per hour blow over the City from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area throughout the summer months, in addition to winter storms.

e. Summary. These local climatic conditions affect the acceleration, intensity, and size of fire in the community. Times of little or no rainfall, of low humidity and high temperatures create extremely hazardous conditions, particularly as they relate to wood shake and shingle roof fires and conflagrations. The winds experienced in this area can have a tremendous impact upon structure fires of buildings in close proximity to one another, commonly found in the City of Sausalito. During wood shake and shingle roof fires, or exposure fires, winds can carry sparks and burning brands to other structures, thus spreading the fire and causing conflagrations. In building fires, winds can literally force fires back into the building and can create a blowtorch effect, in addition to preventing “natural” ventilation and cross-ventilation efforts.

2. Geographic and Topographic.

a. Geographic Factors. The fire environment of a community is primarily a combination of two factors: the area’s physical geographic characteristics and the historic pattern of urban-suburban development. These two factors, alone and combined, create a mixture of environments which ultimately determines the area’s fire protection needs.

The City Council finds Sausalito is in a unique geographic area, built upon a tree-covered 980-foot slope with an average grade of 22 percent. Slopes of 60 percent are commonplace. The City is waterbound at its base, and along its ridgeline is a national park area of highly combustible grass, brush, and trees, mainly eucalyptus.

Lands in the southerly portion of the City were subdivided in 1850, and in the central and northerly portions in 1870. The structural buildup occurred between the 1880’s and 1920’s in many of the residential areas and the City’s commercial center. The original construction consists of frame structures built with little or no side yard setbacks on small, narrow lots typical of that era.

The domestic water supply is located at the end of the Marin Municipal Water District’s distribution system and consists of five levels of gravity systems of varying pressures and capacities. Sixteen percent of the City’s hydrants are rated at less than 500 gallons per minute and, therefore, are deficient for fire protection.

b. Seismic Location. The relatively young geological processes that have created the San Francisco Bay Area are still active today. The City sits between two active earthquake faults (San Andreas and the Hayward/Calaveras) and numerous potentially active faults. Approximately 50 percent of the City’s land surface is in the high-to-moderate seismic hazard zones.

c. Size and Population. The City of Sausalito comprises approximately three square miles including a permanent urban population of 7,500. Transient populations vary with summer months and special events drawing as high as 15,000 people to the City. Within the City of Sausalito are two fire stations and a total of 19 Fire Department personnel. The Fire Department handles diverse responsibilities including wildland, urban, freeway, air, water, and emergency paramedical.

d. Roads and Streets. Most of Sausalito’s street and pathway systems were laid out in the 1870’s. Limited off-street parking has been provided; therefore, many of the City’s streets have less than 20 feet of unobstructed width and turning radius, as required by the Uniform Fire Code, Section 902.2.2.1. Roadways with less than 20 feet of unobstructed paved surface are considered hazardous in terms of fire access and protection.

e. Topography. The City of Sausalito is a conglomeration of bay fill, steep hills, valleys, and ridges. The flatter lands are found in the central and southern portions of the district. Most of the existing urban and suburbanized areas are built on slopes ranging from five percent to 70 percent grades.

Elevations are varied in the City with City Hall listed as 10 feet above sea level. Elevations in the Wolfback Ridge development are in the area of 980 feet above sea level.

Correspondingly, there is much diversity in slope percentages with a large percentage of homes in the 25 percent to 45 percent range and the average slope being 22 percent. Slope is an important factor in fire spread. As a basic rule of thumb, the rate of spread will double as the slope percentage doubles, all other factors remaining the same.

f. Vegetation. Sausalito’s semi-arid Mediterranean-type climate produces vegetation similar to that of most of Marin County, with specific growth locale a result of topography and prevailing wind. The south facing exposure is primarily rye grass with occasional clumps of bay and oak trees in the more sheltered pockets. The north facing slopes are heavily wooded from lower elevations to ridge with oak, bay, and eucalyptus trees and minor shrubs of the general chaparral class.

Expansion of the residential community into areas of heavier vegetation has resulted in homes existing in close proximity to dense natural foliage. Often such dwellings are completely surrounded by highly combustible vegetation compounding the fire problem from a conflagration point of view.

A large percentage of the structures in the City have costly shingle or shake roofs. This very flammable material is susceptible to ignition by embers from a wildland fire, furthering the spread of fire to adjacent buildings.

g. Summary. The above listed conditions increase the magnitude, exposure, accessibility problems and fire hazards presented to the Sausalito Fire Department. The protection of life and property from fire is difficult due to limited access problems created by water, cliffs, steep slopes, and the lack of side yard setbacks, as well as the combustible structures and their roofs.

Fire following an earthquake has the potential of causing greater loss of life and damage than the earthquake itself. A large percentage of dwellings in the City have wood shingle roofs.

The City’s industrial areas are located in the highest seismic risk zones. The highest seismic risk zone also contains the largest concentration of hazardous materials. Hazardous materials could pose the greatest threat to the largest number, should a significant seismic event occur. The Fire Department’s resources would have to be prioritized to mitigate the greatest threat, and may likely be unavailable for smaller single-dwelling or structure fires.

Other variables may tend to intensify the situation:

i. The extent of damage to the water system;

ii. The extent of isolation due to bridge and/or freeway overpass collapse;

iii. The extent of roadway damage and/or amount of debris blocking the roadways;

iv. Climatic conditions (hot, dry weather with high winds);

v. Time of day will influence the amount of traffic on roadways and could intensify the risk to life during normal business hours;

vi. The availability of timely mutual aid or military assistance;

vii. The portion of dwellings with wood shingle roof coverings could result in conflagrations.

Conclusion: Local climatic, geographic and topographic conditions impact fire prevention efforts, and the frequency, spread, acceleration, intensity, and size of fire involving buildings in this community. Further, they impact potential damage to all structures from earthquake and subsequent fire. Therefore, it is found to be reasonably necessary that the International Fire Code, California Fire Code and the State Building Standards Code be changed or modified to mitigate the effects of the above conditions.

Furthermore, California Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7 requires that the modification or change be expressly marked and identified as to which each finding refers. Therefore, the City of Sausalito finds that the following table provides code sections that have been modified pursuant to Sausalito Ordinance No. 1240, which are building standards as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 18909, and the associated referenced conditions for modification due to local climatic, geographical, and topographical reasons:

8.42.033    Appeals.

8.42.010 Adequacy of fire protection.
The City Council finds that certain areas within the City are not provided with a public water supply sufficient to allow for safe and adequate fire protection. The City Council further finds that the hilly terrain, natural vegetation, narrow streets and other conditions prevailing within the City create unusual problems of fire protection and require the exercise of caution in allowing construction in those areas which are without a water supply sufficient to provide adequate fire protection or in those areas where there is inadequate access for fire suppression apparatus.

Based on the findings set forth above, and also based on the findings at SMC 8.40.110 and based on the specific local conditions set forth in these findings, the City Council finds that the following provisions and modifications of the uniform codes are required. [Amended during 2013 reformat; Ord. 1163 § 2(Exh. B), 2002; Ord. 1139 § 2, 1999; Ord. 1115 § 2, 1996; Ord. 1053 § 11, 1990.]

8.42.020 Restrictions on building permit issuance.
As a result of the conditions referred to in SMC 8.42.010, and in order to ensure so far as possible the safety of residents of the City from conflagrations, the Building Official shall not issue any building permits for any new structures in areas meeting the criteria described in SMC 8.42.010 without the approval of the Fire Chief of the City of Sausalito. [Ord. 1163 § 2(Exh. B), 2002; Ord. 1139 § 2, 1999; Ord. 1115 § 2, 1996; Ord. 1053 § 11, 1990.]

8.42.030 Conditions of building permit – Appeal procedure.
If the property for which the permit is applied is served by a private water supply, a complete description of the supply must be included with the plans submitted for permit approval. If the property owner intends to extend a water main or to provide other types of fire protection, the plans shall be described in the request and shown on the building plan submitted for approval. All such requests for building permits shall be referred to the City Fire Chief for approval. Approval of the issuance of a building permit shall be given by the City Fire Chief if, in his opinion, an adequate water supply is available for the protection of the proposed structures which meets the fire flow requirements outlined in the latest edition of the Insurance Services Office (I.S.O.) Guidelines for Determination of Fire Flow. If the water supply is determined by the Fire Chief not to be adequate in accordance with these guidelines, the permit applicant may elect to install either temporary or permanent facilities for protection prior to commencement of construction. Such temporary or permanent facilities for fire protection shall be approved by the City Fire Chief, and the Fire Chief shall notify the Building Official not to issue a building permit until the installation of the approved facilities has been completed to the satisfaction of the Fire Chief. [Ord. 1163 § 2(Exh. B), 2002; Ord. 1139 § 2, 1999; Ord. 1115 § 2, 1996; Ord. 1053 § 10, 1990.]

8.42.031 Authority to arrest and issue citations.
A. The Fire Chief, Fire Marshal, and Fire Prevention Officer shall have authority to arrest or to cite any person who violates any provision of this chapter involving the Uniform Fire Code or the California Building Standards Code regulations relating to fire and public safety as adopted by the State Fire Marshal, in the manner provided for the arrest or release on citation and notice to appear with respect to misdemeanors or infractions, as prescribed by Chapters 5, 5c and 5d of Title 3, Part 2 of the California Penal Code, including Section 853.6, or as the same hereafter may be amended.

B. It is the intent of the City of Sausalito that the immunities provided in Penal Code Section 836.5 are applicable to aforementioned officers and employees exercising their arrest or citation authority within the course and scope of their employment (Ocean Shores 7-05)(Ocean Shores 7-05)pursuant to this chapter. [Ord. 1163 § 2(Exh. B), 2002; Ord. 1139 § 2, 1999.]

8.42.032 Penalties.
A. The violations of the California Fire Code as adopted herein are misdemeanors/infractions and are subject to the penalties set forth herein.

B. The first citation, within a 12-month period, for violations of the Uniform Fire Code and any amendments adopted herein shall be treated as a civil penalty payable directly to the Sausalito Fire Department and is set at $150.00 plus the actual costs of all inspections required to gain compliance at the rate set from time to time by the Fire Department. The civil penalties shall be a debt owed to the Department by the person responsible for the violation within 30 days after the date of mailing of the citation unless an appeal is filed as provided in SMC 8.42.033. Upon failure to pay the civil penalty when due, the responsible person shall be liable in a civil action brought by the Department for such civil penalty and costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

C. Any subsequent citations within a 12-month period for any violations of the Uniform Fire Code and any amendments adopted herein shall be misdemeanors/infractions, and shall be subject to the penalties set forth herein.

D. The imposition of one penalty for any violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or defects within a reasonable time and, when not otherwise specified, each day that a violation occurs or continues, after a final notice has been delivered, shall constitute a separate offense. The application of both penalties shall not be held to prevent the enforced correction of prohibited conditions.

E. Nothing contained in subsections A through F of this section shall be construed or interpreted to prevent the Department from recovering all costs associated with a Fire Department response as described in Section 101.5 of the 2000 Uniform Fire Code.

F. Any violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute a public nuisance and shall entitle the Department to collect the costs of abatement and related administrative costs by a nuisance abatement lien as more particularly set forth in Government Code Section 38773.1, and by special assessment to be collected as more particularly set forth. At least 30 days prior to recordation of the lien, or submission of the report to the Tax Collector for collection of this special assessment, the record owner shall receive notice from the Chief of the Department’s intent to charge the property owner for all administrative costs associated with enforcement of this chapter and abatement of the nuisance. The notice shall include a summary of costs associated with enforcement of this chapter and abatement of the nuisance. The property owner may appeal the Chief’s decision to the City Council within 15 days of the date of the notice and request a public hearing prior to recordation of the lien or submission of the report to the Tax Collector for collection of the special assessment. In addition to the foregoing, the Fire Department is authorized to prosecute a civil action to collect such abatement costs from the property owner or other person in possession or control of the affected property, and shall be entitled to recover such abatement costs, together with the cost of litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. The provisions of this section shall not apply to corrective actions for the clearance of brush or vegetative growth from structures as outlined in Section 16.2 of Appendix 11-A of the 2000 Uniform Fire Code as amended in Section 10 of this code. [Amended during 2013 reformat; Ord. 1163 § 2(Exh. B), 2002; Ord. 1139 § 2, 1999.]

8.42.033 Appeals.
A. Any person receiving a citation for a civil penalty pursuant to SMC 8.42.032(B) or a bill for Fire Department response costs and expenses pursuant to Section 101.5(c) of the Uniform Fire Code, may file within 30 days after the date of mailing the citation or bill an administrative appeal against imposition of the civil penalty or response costs and expense. The appeal shall be in writing and filed with the Fire Chief, and shall include a copy of the bill and statement of the grounds for appeal. The Fire Chief shall conduct an administrative hearing on the appeal, after giving the appellant at least 10 days’ advance written notice of the time and place of the hearing. Within 10 days after the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall give written notice of the decision to the appellant, which decision shall be final. If the appeal is denied in part or full, all amounts due shall be paid within 30 days after the mailing of the notice of the decision of the Hearing Officer.

B. Whenever the Chief shall disapprove an application or refuse to grant a permit applied for, or when it is claimed that the provisions of the code do not apply or that the true intent and meaning of the code have been misconstrued or wrongly interpreted, the applicant may appeal from the decision of the Chief to the City Council within 10 days from the date of the decision. The provision of this section shall not apply to corrective actions for the clearance of brush or vegetative growth from structures as outlined in Item 16.2 of Appendix 11-A of the 2000 Uniform Fire Code as amended in Section 10 of this code, or to matters for which an appeal is provided pursuant to subsection A of this section.

EARTHQUAKE HAZARD ANALYSIS OF EXISTING BUILDINGS
Sections:

8.43.010    Purpose.

8.43.020    Scope.

8.43.030    Definitions.

8.43.040    Compliance requirements.

8.43.050    Administrative provisions.

8.43.060    Repair requirements.

8.43.010 Purpose.
Unreinforced masonry (URN) bearing wall buildings have shown poor performance in past earthquakes, for example: 1868 Hayward, 1906 San Francisco, 1925 Santa Barbara, 1933 Long Beach, 1952 Kern County, 1971 San Fernando, 1982 Coalinga, 1987 Whittier, 1989 Loma Prieta and 1992 Humboldt County. The State of California has declared through Senate Bill 547 (Section 8875 et seq. of the Government Code) that the hazard posed by this class of building is unacceptable and that communities must identify unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings and notify building owners that the building is considered to be one of a general type of structure that historically has exhibited little resistance to earthquake motion. The City of Sausalito provided the required notice on April 17, 1990.

It is generally accepted that the intensity of earthquakes which could reasonably be expected to occur in California would be sufficient to cause buildings with minimal seismic resistance characteristics to be seriously damaged or, perhaps, to collapse, causing serious injury or death to the occupants or passersby.

It is the intent of the City of Sausalito to gather information on the extent and nature of the seismic strengthening of unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings which will be needed to reduce the risk of life loss or injury. This chapter provides time periods and standards under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed. It requires that the results of the analysis be presented to the City for review.

It is the further intent of the City of Sausalito to consider a follow-up ordinance which requires buildings found to be deficient to be strengthened in a time period and in a manner which accounts for public safety concerns and private owner interests.

The final intent of the City is to assure that seismic strengthening of any unreinforced masonry bearing wall building be completed when an owner elects to significantly remodel such building. [Ord. 1079 § 1, 1992.]

8.43.020 Scope.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings which have been identified as having unreinforced masonry bearing walls by the survey filed with the California Seismic Safety Commission. [Ord. 1079 § 1, 1992.]

8.43.030 Definitions.
“Unreinforced masonry (URN) bearing wall” is a masonry wall in which the area of reinforcing steel is less than 25 percent of the minimum steel ratios required by the building code for reinforced masonry. [Ord. 1079 § 1, 1992.]

8.43.040 Compliance requirements.
The owner of each building within the scope of this chapter shall, upon notice by the City and within the time limits set forth in this chapter, cause a structural engineering analysis to be made of the building by an engineering design professional licensed by the State to practice as such. The owner of a building within the scope of this chapter shall comply with this requirement by submitting to the Building Official for review, within six months after mailed notice by the City, a structural analysis report which shall include the following information:

A. Whether the building meets minimum requirements of Appendix Chapter 1 of the Uniform Code for Building Conservation, 1991 Edition.

B. If the building does not meet minimum requirements, what specific deficiencies exist. Structural calculations for the existing building should be compared to the minimum requirements.

C. What modifications to the structure are necessary in order to meet minimum requirements.

D. A preliminary cost estimate of the necessary modifications.

E. An estimate of the duration of construction period required.

The structural analysis report should describe all methods employed, all tests conducted, and all measurements and calculations which provided the basis for the conclusions drawn. [Ord. 1079 § 1, 1992.]

8.43.050 Administrative provisions.
A. Notice. The Building Official shall issue a notice as provided in this section to the owner of each building within the scope of this chapter.

B. Notice – Contents. The notice shall be in writing and shall be served upon the owner either personally or by certified or registered mail, as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, and upon the person, if any, in apparent charge or control of the building. The notice shall specify that the building has been determined by the Building Official to be within the scope of this chapter and, therefore, a structural engineering analysis of the building is required.

C. Enforcement. The City will be empowered to seek an order from the court to require the study to be done. [Ord. 1079 § 1, 1992.]

8.43.060 Repair requirements.
No building for which the structural analysis consistent with this chapter is submitted to the City will be required to complete the modifications needed to meet minimum requirements except that unreinforced masonry wall buildings to which additions, alterations or repairs are made, the cost of which exceeds 50 percent of the replacement value, shall be made to comply with the provisions of Appendix Chapter 1 of the Uniform Code for Building Conservation, 1991 Edition, published by the International Conference of Building Officials.

Article I. Statutory Authorization – Findings of Fact – Purpose and Methods

8.48.011 Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of California has, in Government Code Sections 65302 and 65560, conferred upon local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.012 Findings of fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.013 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A. To protect human life and health;

B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;

C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.014 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

Article II. Definitions

8.48.020 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet, a clearly defined channel does not exist, the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

Area of Special Flood Hazard. See “Special flood hazard area.”

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “100-year flood”).

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall conform to the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic actions. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations and storage of equipment or materials.

“Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) the overflow of flood waters, (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source, and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition.

“Flood boundary and floodway map” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the area of flood hazard and the floodway.

“Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, and the FIRM, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

“Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”).

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-control works and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes Federal, State or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Fraud and victimization” as related to Article VI of this chapter, Variance Procedure, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Hardship” as related to Article VI of this chapter, Variance Procedure, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure that is:

1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved State program, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or directly by the Secretary of the Interior, in states without approved programs.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement (see “Basement” definition).

1. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure is not considered a building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

a. The flood openings standard in SMC 8.48.051(C)(3)(a);

b. The anchoring standards in SMC 8.48.051(A)(1);

c. The construction materials and methods standards in SMC 8.48.051(B);

d. The standards for utilities in SMC 8.48.052.

2. For residential structures, all subgrade-enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see “Basement” definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent.

“Market value” is defined in SMC 8.48.043(B).

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

“New construction” means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after August 28, 1980 (Ord. 975, July 29, 1980), and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“One-hundred-year flood” means a flood which has a one percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the “base flood,” which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

“Person” means an individual or his agent, firm, partnership, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions.

“Public safety and nuisance” as related to Article VI of this chapter, Variance Procedure, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is

1. Built on a single chassis;

2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.

“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

“Riverine” means relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

“Sand dunes” means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1 – A30, AE, A99, AH, V1 – V30, VE or V.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and other proposed new development, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of the manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

1. Before the improvement or repair is started; or

2. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that could otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

V Zone or VE Zone. See “Coastal high hazard area.”

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. “Watercourse” includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

“X (shaded) zone” means an area of moderate flood hazard, between the limits of the 100-year and 500-year floods. The combined areas of special flood hazard and moderate flood hazard constitute the area susceptible to the adverse impacts of sea level rise. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

Article III. General Provisions

8.48.031 Lands to which this chapter applies.
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Sausalito. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.032 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
Special flood hazards identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “Flood Insurance Study for Marin County California” revised March 16, 2016, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter as well as amendments thereto. The current, effective copies of these documents are on file at 420 Litho Street, Sausalito, California. The current, effective flood insurance study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.033 Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.034 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.035 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body;

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sausalito, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.037 Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

1. Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;

2. All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained;

3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

4. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, “adversely affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

B. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

2. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

C. Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with SMC 8.48.032, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from Federal, State or other source, in order to administer Article V of this chapter.

D. Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated:

1. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation of a watercourse;

2. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

3. Require that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

All new and replacement manufactured homes and additions to manufactured homes shall:

A. Be elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; and

B. Be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.055 Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in SMC 8.48.032 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.056 Coastal high hazard areas.
Within coastal high hazard areas established in SMC 8.48.032 the following standards shall apply:

A.

Article VI. Variance Procedure

8.48.061 Appeal Board.
A. The City Council of the City of Sausalito shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B. The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C. In passing upon such applications, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges.

D. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (C)(1) through (11) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

E. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

F. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all variance actions and appeals, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

G. A fee for variances may be established by the City Council by resolution from time to time. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.48.062 Conditions for variances.
A. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.

B. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

E. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator that:

1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and

2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.

G. A copy of any notice given under subsection F of this section shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Marin County Recorder in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. [Ord. 1234 § 3, 2016.]

8.54.010 Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of the City Council in enacting the provisions of this chapter are to:

A. Provide uniform regulations that conform to the California Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code Section 40000 et seq.) and Assembly Bill 939 that require each local jurisdiction in the State to divert 50 percent of discarded materials from landfills by December 31, 2000;

B. Facilitate the City’s efforts to reduce the amount of debris waste in local landfills;

C. Create a process that will divert at least 50 percent of all debris waste from most construction, demolition and renovation projects. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.020 Applicability.
The requirements of this chapter shall apply to every project within the City jurisdiction unless the project is otherwise exempt in accordance with the provisions of SMC 8.54.030. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.030 Exempt projects.
Projects that are exempt from the provisions of this chapter include only those that involve only a roofing permit, drywall repair and/or replacement and/or window replacements. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.040 Recycling management plan processing and procedures.
All project applicants shall complete and submit a recycling management plan (RMP), on a form approved by the Community Development Department as modified from time to time. The RMP shall be completed and submitted as part of the application package for any project unless exempted or waived pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

The completed RMP shall include the following information:

A. The estimated volume or weight of debris, by materials type, to be generated;

B. The vendor and/or facility that the applicant proposes to use to receive the materials; and

C. The estimated volume or weight of materials that will be landfilled.

The RMP form will be reviewed and processed by the Building Division prior to issuance of any permits for compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Once approved, the RMP will be marked “approved,” filed and a copy provided to the applicant with the applicable City permits. If the Building Division is unable to approve the RMP, it will be returned to the applicant with a correction note and no permits will be issued until the revised RMP is able to be approved.

Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be listed as a condition for initial permitting and as a condition of approval for the final inspection and/or final occupancy permit of any project to which a permit was issued. Prior to issuance of a final inspection or final occupancy, the applicant shall demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this chapter per SMC 8.54.070. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.050 Waiver of recycling management plan.
Submittal of an RMP form will be waived by the Community Development Director if a debris box is obtained from the City’s franchised waste hauler. To qualify for this waiver, the applicant shall submit a written agreement with the franchised waste hauler with the application package for any project.

Prior to issuance of a final inspection or final occupancy permit, the applicant shall demonstrate compliance with the diversion requirements by submitting documentation from the City’s franchised waste hauler that the material was hauled off the site per the original agreement. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.060 Infeasibility exemption.
A. If the Community Development Director determines that it is infeasible for the project applicant to meet the diversion requirements due to unique circumstances, the Director shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall issue a final inspection or final occupancy permit once it is determined that the maximum feasible diversion requirements are met. Factors used to determine infeasibility include, but are not limited to:

1. The majority of the demolition consists of nonrecyclable material.

2. Hazardous material.

B. Factors used to determine the maximum feasible diversion requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Applicant identification of material that is able to be recycled with a weight estimate.

2. Verification from the City’s franchised waste hauler of the material’s weight estimate.

3. Verification from a waste hauler to the facility to receive the materials stating its good faith weight estimate. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.070 Submission of recycling/reuse documentation (RRD).
Unless the applicant has been granted a waiver of a recycling management plan, an infeasibility exemption or the project is exempt pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the diversion requirement shall be the maximum feasible diversion rate as determined by the Community Development Director. The applicant shall submit recycling/reuse documentation (RRD) prior to the City performing a final inspection and shall include all of the following:

A. A copy of the recycling management plan;

B. Receipts or reports from the facility that received each material showing the weight of the material received. A collection facility must have a minimum diversion rate of 50 percent to issue complying receipts or reports;

C. Any additional information the applicant believes is relevant to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this section.

Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all construction and demolition debris diverted or landfilled are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. For construction and demolition debris for which weighing is not practical, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the County of Marin Joint Powers Authority for this purpose as such rates may be amended from time to time. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.080 Monitoring.
This chapter shall be monitored for effectiveness in promoting construction and demolition material recycling and reuse. Reporting to the Community Development Department by the City’s franchised waste hauler will include an analysis of construction and demolition material recycling quantities and opportunities to increase service area coverage and recycling rates. An annual report shall be provided to the Community Development Department by the franchised waste hauler. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.090 Franchised waste hauler responsibilities.
The City Council has by separate action authorized a single franchised waste hauler to provide debris boxes within the City limits. Other vendors associated with the project may not provide debris boxes for the project. However, in association with their contracted activities, vendors may provide construction and demolition debris removal to an approved collection facility by means of motor vehicles.

All debris boxes removed from the City by the franchised waste hauler shall be disposed of at an approved disposal facility. The franchise hauler will ensure that at least a 50 percent diversion rate for general disposal of construction and demolition waste has been achieved. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.100 Compliance.
The Community Development Director may withhold issuance of the final occupancy permit for any project unless and until the Director has approved the recycling/reuse documentation (RRD).

If the Community Development Director determines that the RRD is incomplete or fails to indicate that at least 50 percent of all construction and demolition debris generated by the project will be reused or recycled, unless a lesser amount has been approved pursuant to this chapter, the Director shall either:

A. Deny the final occupancy permit for any project until adequate recycling/reuse documentation has been provided; or

B. Seek enforcement pursuant to this chapter; or

C. Assess an administrative verification fee of $500.00 to determine if the vendor used to haul off the material, other than the franchised waste hauler, has utilized an approved collection facility. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.110 Emergency demolition permit.
If emergency demolition is required to protect public health or safety, approval of a recycling management plan (RMP) to begin demolition activities shall not be required. However, the required recycling/reuse documentation (RRD), minus the RMP, should be submitted as soon as feasible and is required before the final occupancy permit is issued. The Community Development Director shall only approve the RRD if it indicates that at least 50 percent of all construction and demolition debris generated by the project has been diverted or is deemed exempt by the Director. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.120 Enforcement.
Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced pursuant to Chapter 1.10 SMC, except the amount of any fine imposed shall be $100.00 for the first day of violation, $150.00 for the second day of the violation, $200.00 for the third day of the violation, $300.00 for the fourth day of violation, and $500.00 for every day thereafter. No temporary occupancy or final inspection shall be provided until all fines are collected and the appropriate measures have been made to conform to this chapter. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

8.54.130 Severability.
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this chapter or any part thereof. The City of Sausalito hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter irrespective of the fact that one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective. To this end the provision of this chapter are declared to be severable. [Ord. 1181 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1180 § 1, 2006.]

E. Individuals may request a determination by the Planning Commission, or the Planning Commission can initiate its own determination in cases where there is additional uncertainty of the locations of zoning district boundaries.

This subsection determines how the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance apply to development projects in progress at the time requirements are changed.

A. All discretionary permit applications that have been determined to be complete as provided by Government Code Section 65943 before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment, shall be processed according to the regulations and requirements of the Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time the application was accepted as complete.

Any use authorized by an approved permit (including administrative design review permit, conditional use permit, variance, or design review permit) for which construction has not yet begun as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, may still be constructed as provided by the approved permit, as long as the construction is completed and/or the approved use is established before the expiration of the permit pursuant to SMC 10.50.120 (Implementation of permits), or where applicable, before the expiration of any time extension granted under SMC 10.50.140 (Extension of approved permits).

D. No provision of this title shall require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or any subsequent amendment of this title.

E. Any modification of an administrative use permit, design review permit, conditional use permit or variance, or any major modification of a building permit issued prior to the date of the ordinance codified in this title, shall conform to the standards in effect at the time of the revised application. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

C. Minimum Requirements. When interpreting and applying the regulations of this title, all provisions shall be considered to be the minimum requirements, unless stated otherwise (e.g., height limits for buildings and structures, building coverage, and floor area are maximum requirements, not minimum).

D. Allowable Land Uses. If a proposed land use is not specifically listed in Division II of this title (Zoning Districts Regulations), the use shall not be allowed except as follows:

1. The Community Development Director may determine that a proposed use not listed in Division II (Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 SMC) is equivalent to a listed use and is allowable if the Director can make the following findings:

a. The proposed use will be consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the general plan;

b. The proposed use will meet the purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district; and

c. The proposed use will share characteristics common with those listed in the zoning district, and will not be of greater intensity or density, or generate more environmental impact than those uses listed in the zoning district.

2. When the Community Development Director determines that a proposed use is equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use in determining where it is allowed, what permits are required, and what other standards and requirements of this title apply.

3. Determinations that specific uses are equivalent to listed uses will be recorded by the Community Development Department, and will be incorporated into the land use definitions of the Zoning Ordinance when amendments to the ordinance are next considered.

4. Where the Community Development Director cannot make an interpretation, applicant shall request a determination of use, consistent with SMC 10.80.080 (Determination of use).

E. Record of Interpretations. Whenever the Community Development Director determines that the applicability or meaning of any of the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance are unclear generally or as applied to a specific case, the Community Development Director may issue an official interpretation. Official interpretations shall be:

1. In writing, and shall quote the provisions of this title being interpreted, together with an explanation and applicability; and

2. Distributed to the City Council, Planning Commission, and members of the Planning Division staff.

Any Zoning Ordinance provisions that are determined by the Community Development Director to be unclear will be corrected by amending the Zoning Ordinance as soon as practical. Until amendments can occur, the Community Development Director shall maintain a complete record of all official interpretations, available for public review, and indexed by the number of the Zoning Ordinance section that is the subject of the interpretation.

F. Appeal and Referral. Any determinations or interpretations by the Community Development Director may be appealed as provided by Chapter 10.84 SMC (Appeals). The Community Development Director may refer any interpretation of this title to the Planning Commission for a determination. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

All titles and parts of titles of the City of Sausalito Municipal Code in conflict with this title are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict, and no further. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.12.110 Severability.
If any chapter, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or part of this Zoning Ordinance is for any reason found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this title, which shall be in full force and effect. The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted this title with each chapter, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or part thereof irrespective of the fact that one or more chapters, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases or parts be declared invalid or unconstitutional. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

Table 10.20-2 (Site Development Standards – Open Space and Public Districts) establishes parcel requirements and site development standards for the open space and public districts. Minimum standards are provided for parcel size, lot width and setbacks. Residential density, floor area ratio, building coverage and height limit are maximum amounts allowed. Specific uses may be subject to additional specific standards. In addition, certain standards vary depending on the applicable situation. Refer to noted sections. The following sections also apply:

A. Minimum Lot Size. New parcels proposed in a subdivision shall also comply with applicable provisions of SMC Title 9 (Subdivisions). Existing parcels which do not meet the minimum lot area or width requirements specified by this section may be developed in accordance with the development standards outlined in Table 10.20-2 (Site Development Standards – Open Space and Public Districts); provided, that the subject parcel has been legally created.

B. Setbacks. Setbacks will only be required where the subject parcel is adjacent to a residential zoning district. Additional requirements for setbacks between structures on the same site, and setbacks in other situations, are established by Chapter 10.40 SMC (General Development Regulations), including SMC 10.40.080 (Exceptions to required setbacks) and Chapter 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements) for certain specific land uses.

10.22.010 Specific purposes.
In addition to the general purposes listed in SMC 10.10.030 (Title and purpose), the specific purposes of the residential zoning districts include the following:

A. To provide suitable locations for a variety of housing types and classes of dwelling accommodations needed to serve the population of the City of Sausalito;

B. To provide stability and protection for residential areas;

C. To control the density and distribution of population throughout the area in conformance with the general plan;

D. To provide for public and private facilities necessary to serve residential areas;

E. To ensure sensitive hillside residential design; and

F. To provide opportunities for religious institutions, day care facilities, residential care facilities and other uses that are compatible with and desirable for residential neighborhoods. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.22.020 Additional purposes.
The additional purposes of each residential zoning district are as follows:

A. Single-Family Residential (R-1). The single-family residential zoning district (R-1) provides for low density, detached single-family residential land use. Densities are based on existing development and are meant to be protected and preserved. Development standards reflect the scale, character, and intensity of existing neighborhoods.

The single-family residential zoning district is a very low to low density residential district with three different minimum lot sizes ranging from one dwelling unit per 6,000 square feet of land area (lot size) to one dwelling unit per 20,000 square feet of land area (lot size), depending on the environmental constraints and neighborhood character. The district is divided into three subdistricts (as indicated in Table 10.22-2, Site Development Standards – Residential Zoning Districts) based on these densities, including R-1-6, R-1-8 and R-1-20.

B. Two-Family Residential (R-2). The two-family residential zoning district (R-2) provides for a mix of single-family and duplex dwellings. The district is intended to provide for development of single- and two-family dwellings in appropriately located areas and with the appropriate character.

The two-family residential zoning district is a medium to medium-high density residential land use category. Densities are one dwelling unit per 2,500 square feet or 5,000 square feet, depending on location. The district is divided into two subdistricts (as indicated in Table 10.22-2, Site Development Standards – Residential Zoning Districts) based on these densities, including R-2-2.5 and R-2-5.

C. Planned Residential (PR). The planned residential zoning district preserves and maintains existing medium-high residential density development, including townhomes and condominiums.

Planned residential is a medium-high density residential district with a residential density of one dwelling unit per 1,980 square feet.

D. Multiple-Family Residential (R-3). The multiple-family residential zoning district provides areas for residential neighborhoods of single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, duplexes, apartments, and other multiple-family attached dwelling units, such as condominiums. The multiple-family district provides for innovative site planning, while providing on-site recreational amenities and location near major community facilities, business centers and/or major streets.

The multiple-family district is a high density residential district with a residential density of one dwelling unit per 1,500 square feet.

E. Houseboats (H). The houseboat zoning district is intended to maintain and enhance the City’s diverse housing stock and to continue to allow houseboat uses on the City’s waterfront.

The houseboat district is a low density residential zoning district with a residential density of one dwelling unit per 10,000 square feet.

F. Arks (A). The residential ark district promotes and encourages traditional, pre-1963 single-family arks. The district encourages arks’ maintenance, restoration and preservation in a manner compatible with surrounding marine and commercial uses. Residential arks are a high density residential land use with a residential density of one unit per 1,500 square feet. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.22.030 Allowable land use.
Table 10.22-1 (Land Uses Allowed in Residential Districts) outlines the land uses that are allowed in each of the residential zoning districts. As indicated in the legend, each use is either permitted (no discretionary permit required), or one of two discretionary use permits are required (minor use permit, conditional use permit), as explained in Division IV of this title (Permit Procedures), Chapters 10.50 through 10.68 SMC. Blanks indicate the use is not allowed in that particular district. The last column identifies sections of the Zoning Ordinance where additional requirements are found and apply to the land use. Additional requirements for specific uses set forth in Chapter 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements) may also be applicable.

10.22.040 Site development requirements.
Minimum requirements are established for parcel size, lot width, and setbacks. Requirements for density, floor area ratio, coverage and building height are maximum amounts allowed.

A. Parcel Size. Each parcel proposed for development or a new land use, and each new parcel proposed in a subdivision, shall comply with the provisions that follow, or the applicable provisions of SMC 10.40.030 (Minimum parcel standards). New parcels proposed in a subdivision shall also comply with all applicable provisions of SMC Title 9 (Subdivisions). Existing parcels that do not meet the minimum lot area or width requirements specified by this section as set forth in Table 10.22-2 may be developed in accordance with the development standards listed below; provided, that the subject parcel has been legally created.

B. Lot Width. Additional lot width requirements may be established or allowed by an applicable -Pd overlay district. (See SMC 10.28.060, Planned development (-Pd).)

C. Setbacks. Different setbacks may also apply where a zoning district is combined with an overlay zoning district. Ten-foot front yard setbacks are required where designated on the zoning map. Minimum side yard setbacks may be increased in other situations as outlined in Chapter 10.40 SMC (General Development Regulations).

D. Density. Density is based on net parcel area. Maximum density for single-family dwellings in the single-family residential (R-1) district may be increased where additional units are approved as provided by SMC 10.44.080 (Accessory dwelling unit regulations).

E. Building Height. Building height is measured from the natural average grade. Maximum building height may vary depending on parcel topography and may vary for other specific features of the site.

F. Additional Requirements. Land uses shall comply with the additional requirements established by Chapters 10.40 (General Development Requirements) and 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements).

A. To provide for nonpolluting, low intensity industrial uses;

B. To provide for uses compatible with an industrial area;

C. To provide for non-invasive industry with minimal community impacts;

D. To provide for industrial, service and arts uses, with the necessary support elements for the Sausalito community;

E. To ensure all uses and development are compatible with the marinship specific plan;

F. To encourage a mixture of uses;

G. To provide for urban development standards;

H. To maintain the land use entitlements that were contained in prior code Section 10.700 (Industrial District Regulations); and

I. To provide for public access to and views of Richardson Bay.

The industrial marinship district is a base district which is entirely within an overlay district (-M, marinship). The entire district is subject to the requirements established by SMC 10.28.050 (Marinship (-M)). [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.26.020 Land uses allowed.
Table 10.26-1 (Land Uses Allowed in Industrial Marinship District) outlines the uses that are allowed in the industrial marinship district. The notations indicate whether the use is permitted or requires a minor use permit or a conditional use permit. The table also indicates the uses that are subject to additional special requirements and notes the section of the Zoning Ordinance where these standards can be found. In addition, all uses in the industrial marinship district are subject to the marinship overlay district, which identifies use and development requirements for all properties in the marinship specific planning area. Chapter 10.88 SMC (Definitions) provides definitions for general land use categories.

Residential and office uses which existed when the marinship specific plan was adopted are permitted to remain, provided no expansion occurs and no new uses are established, consistent with the marinship specific plan. Existing restaurants are also permitted to remain. Additions to existing restaurants and new eating establishments are subject to the marinship specific plan, this chapter, and SMC 10.44.210 (Restaurants), as indicated in Table 10.26-1 (Land Uses Allowed in Industrial Marinship District). In addition, site-specific exceptions shall be allowed, consistent with the marinship specific plan and SMC 10.28.050 (Marinship (-M)).

10.26.030 Inclusionary uses.
The following uses may be permitted as inclusionary uses only when accompanied by a specified use:

A. Applied Arts. Applied arts uses may not exceed 50 percent of all arts uses on the parcel. Other required arts uses are fine, industrial and marine arts. Applied arts uses that are established consistent with this requirement may remain if other arts uses vacate the site and/or premises. However, the vacated tenant space cannot be utilized for uses other than required arts uses and must remain dedicated to the re-establishment of another required arts use to fulfill the inclusionary use ratio.

B. Commercial Uses. Commercial office and retail uses may not exceed 40 percent of the floor area permitted on the parcel and must be accompanied by noncommercial uses. Commercial office and retail uses that are established consistent with this requirement may remain if other noncommercial uses vacate the site and/or premises. However, the vacated tenant space cannot be utilized for uses other than noncommercial use and must remain dedicated to the re-establishment of another noncommercial use to fulfill the inclusionary use ratio. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.26.040 Site development requirements.
Table 10.26-2 (Site Development Standards – Industrial Marinship Zoning District) establishes parcel requirements and site development standards for the industrial marinship zoning district. Minimum standards are provided for parcel size, lot width and setbacks. Floor area ratio, building coverage and height limit are the maximum amounts allowed. Site development standards are also specified by and contained in SMC 10.28.050 (Marinship (-M)). Specific uses may be subject to additional specific standards.

10.28.010 Purpose.
In addition to the general purposes established in SMC 10.10.030 (Title and purpose), the specific purposes of the overlay districts are as follows:

A. To provide additional regulations for specified areas, to be used in combination with base zoning districts;

B. To address special needs or characteristics of applicable areas of Sausalito;

C. To prevent potential hazards and/or land use conflicts that may be created by unique community character or visual quality; and

D. To provide flexible development standards where doing so is consistent with the objectives, policies and programs of the general plan while ensuring substantial compliance with both specific and general regulations within the underlying district. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.28.020 Applicability.
The requirements of this chapter (Overlay Districts) apply to proposed land uses in addition to all applicable requirements of Chapters 10.20 through 10.26 (base zoning district regulations), 10.40 (General Development Regulations), 10.44 (Specific Use Requirements), and 10.46 SMC (Historic Preservation), and any other applicable requirements of this title. [Ord. 1261 § 22, 2018; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.28.030 Conflicts between provisions.
In the event of any conflict between this chapter (Overlay Districts) and Chapters 10.20 through 10.26 SMC (base zoning district regulations), the requirement specified in the overlay district shall apply. In the event that the overlay district is silent, the requirements of the underlying zoning district shall apply. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.28.040 Historic (-H).
A. Purpose and Intent. The City Council may designate an area containing a number of structures having a special character or special historic, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value, and constituting a distinct section of the City, as a historic overlay district (-H). The historic overlay district designation shall have additional protections for the contributing structures and to ensure that physical alterations to properties within this overlay, including those to noncontributors, are compatible with the character of the district, but shall not affect the underlying base zoning district regulations. In addition to the general purposes of this chapter, the specific purposes of the historic overlay district are to provide the ability to acknowledge, honor, and encourage the continued maintenance and preservation of those select properties in the City that contribute to the City’s architectural and cultural history. Further, it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by providing for the identification, recognition, designation, protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of historic resources that reflect associations important in the City’s history and to:

1. Safeguard the character and history of the City which is reflected in its unique architectural, historic, and cultural heritage through the designation of historic overlay districts;

2. Provide a method for the identification and designation of historic overlay districts;

3. Deter the demolition, alteration, misuse or neglect of historic or architecturally significant structures and sites;

4. Encourage preservation and adaptive reuse of properties in historic overlay districts by allowing changes to accommodate new functions and uses;

5. Provide a review process for alterations, modifications and additions on properties within a historic overlay district, including applying applicable adopted guidelines and policies as adopted by the City;

6. Enhance property values, stabilize neighborhoods, and render City properties in historic overlay districts eligible for benefits and incentives;

7. Foster civic and neighborhood pride and a sense of identity based on the recognition of the City’s past accomplishments as reflected through its buildings, structures, objects, landscape, natural features, infrastructure, and engineering;

8. Strengthen the City’s economy by protecting and enhancing the City’s attraction to residents, tourists, visitors, and others, thereby serving as a stimulus and support to local business and industry; and

9. Identify incentives that are intended to encourage owners to designate, maintain, reuse, rehabilitate, and improve properties within historic overlay districts.

B. Zoning Map Indicator. The -H historic overlay district may be combined with any zoning district. Each -H historic overlay district shall be shown on the zoning map by adding an “-H” designator to the base district designation, followed by the number of the district based on the order of adoption.

C. Applicability. All public and private lands within the boundaries of the historic overlay district shall be subject to this chapter, Chapter 10.46 SMC (Historic Preservation), any other applicable provisions of this title, and applicable provisions of the Sausalito Municipal Code.

D. Land Use and Development Regulations. The land use and development regulations applicable in an -H district shall be as prescribed for the base district with which it is combined unless modified by another overlay district. The requirements of any applicable design and sign guidelines shall govern where conflicts arise. The requirements and standards that apply to land uses and new development within the historic overlay district shall be as provided by Chapters 10.20 through 10.26 SMC (base zoning district regulations) for the applicable base zoning district, unless otherwise provided by a preservation agreement, pursuant to SMC 10.46.070(F) (Written Agreement). Alternate uses may be allowed with a conditional use permit as provided by SMC 10.46.070(D) (Additional Uses).

E. Establishment of Historic Overlay Districts. Historic overlay districts are areas, both contiguous and noncontiguous, of the City that have a special architectural, cultural, or historic significance, and are designated by the City Council. Properties within a historic overlay district may be both contributing and noncontributing, and those contributing properties may be identified on site with an exterior marker or plaque in accordance with City guidelines displaying pertinent information about the resource. A record of properties in each historic overlay district shall be kept by the City, and be provided to the regional information center of the State Office of Historic Preservation and other agencies as required.

F. Criteria for Establishing -H Historic Overlay District. The historic overlay district may be applied to areas which are documented as historic districts. Portions of a base zoning district that do not meet the criteria may be included in a historic overlay district if inclusion is found to be essential to the integrity of the district. The following criteria shall be used to determine application of the historic overlay district:

1. The area possesses character, interest, or value as part of the heritage of the City of Sausalito;

2. The area is the location of a significant historical event;

3. The area is identified with a person or group that contributed significantly to the culture and development of the City of Sausalito;

4. Structures within the area exemplify a particular architectural style or way of life important to the City;

5. Structures within the area are the best remaining examples of an architectural style in a neighborhood;

6. The area or its structures are identified as the work of a person or group whose work has influenced the heritage of the City of Sausalito, the State or the United States;

7. The area is related to a designated historic building or district in such a way that its preservation is essential to the integrity of the building or district;

8. The area’s unique location or singular physical characteristics represent an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood;

9. The area has potential for yielding information of archaeological interest; and/or

10. The area’s integrity as a natural environment strongly contributes to the well-being of the people of the City of Sausalito.

b. Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission shall consider the proposed designation at a noticed public hearing and shall recommend approval, in whole or in part, or disapproval to the application for the designation of a historic overlay district. The decision shall be in writing and state the findings of fact and reasons relied upon to reach the decision and forwarded to the City Council.

c. Hearing and Decision by City Council. The City Council shall consider the proposed designation after receiving the Historic Preservation Commission’s and Planning Commission’s recommendations. The City Council may approve, disapprove, or give modified approval for the historic overlay district. The City Clerk shall then notify the owner(s) of the property or the owners of property in the district of the City Council’s action.

7. Findings. The Historic Preservation Commission and Planning Commission may recommend approval of a historic overlay district if all of the following findings can be made:

a. The area proposed for the historic overlay district is significant to local, regional, State or national history.

b. The criteria identified in subsection F of this section (Criteria for Establishing -H Historic Overlay District) have been considered and apply to the proposed area.

c. Sites within the proposed area that are not individually historic are being included because they are essential to the integrity of the district.

d. Designation of the proposed area as a historic overlay district has been subject to environmental review and the appropriate findings have been made.

e. Designation of the historic overlay district will preserve historic character and integrity of the proposed area.

g. Special criteria are appropriate and being applied in the form of design guidelines, sign guidelines or a conservation plan.

8. Recordation of Decision. A certified copy of the City Council decision shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder by the City Clerk immediately following its effective date. A historic overlay district will be identified on the official map with an “-H”, followed by the number of the district based on the order of adoption.

9. Disapproval of Proposed Designation. Whenever an application for designation of a historic overlay district has been rejected by the City Council, no application that contains the same or substantially the same information as the one disapproved shall be resubmitted within a period of three years from the date of the final action on the prior application. However, if significant new information is made available and provided by and at the expense of the owner(s), the Community Development Director may waive the time limit and permit a new application to be filed.

10. Effect of Designation. Upon designation, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the designated property in the historic overlay district. Any removal or demolition, exterior construction, addition, alteration, or modification, including modifications to landscapes, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.

11. Amendment or Rescission of a Historic Overlay District. Once a designation is made, it shall not be repealed by the City Council unless it is determined at any time that:

a. The historic overlay district no longer meets the criteria for designation due to damage caused by natural disaster (e.g., flood, earthquake, etc.) or reasons otherwise outside of the control of the owner.

b. Changes of use, differences of opinion of subsequent City Councils, desires of property owners, or financial considerations are not sufficient reasons to repeal a designation.

c. If the historic overlay district is repealed, the City’s records shall be updated accordingly.

H. Certificate of Appropriateness Required. No person, owner, or other entity shall restore, rehabilitate, alter, develop, construct, demolish, remove, or change the exterior appearance to a property within a designated historic overlay district without first having undergone review for a certificate of appropriateness as provided in SMC 10.46.060 (Property and review requirements).

A. Purpose and Intent. In addition to the general purposes of this chapter, the specific purposes of the marinship (-M) overlay district are as follows:

1. To identify the area which is the subject of the marinship specific plan;

2. To preserve and enhance the maritime history and character of the marinship area;

3. To preserve and enhance the industrial character and use of the marinship area;

4. To preserve the marinship area’s primary orientation to the use and service of Sausalito residents, rather than tourists;

5. To discourage the development of non-industrial commercial businesses that would displace industrial and marine businesses, or that would disproportionately contribute to traffic generation;

6. To encourage public access and use of the water and waterfront; and

7. To maximize the amount of open water and open shoreline area.

B. Zoning Map Indicator. The -M marinship overlay district may be combined with any zoning district included within the marinship specific plan area. The -M overlay district shall be shown on the zoning map by adding an “-M” designator to the base district designation.

C. Applicability. All lands within the boundaries of the marinship specific plan shall be subject to the regulations of the marinship overlay district.

D. Land Uses. The land use regulations applicable in an -M district shall be as prescribed for the base district with which it is combined unless modified by the following, or by another overlay district. The following land use regulations also apply to the -M overlay district:

1. Commercial Uses. Commercial uses permitted in the marinship overlay district shall be limited to offices which are accessory to other permitted uses, commercial service uses which support other permitted uses and size-restricted restaurants. Offices, retail uses and restaurants with more seats than permitted, which existed prior to April 5, 1988, may remain.

2. Ancillary Offices. The only new office use permitted in the marinship will be limited to accessory office use (the small amount of office activity needed to administer the operations of an approved use.) No new commercial office use will be permitted in the marinship. Existing office buildings and uses may remain as permitted uses.

3. Arts and Applied Arts. Art uses (see Definitions, SMC 10.88.040) are strongly encouraged within the marinship overlay district. Applied art uses may be permitted as long as they do not exceed 50 percent of all art uses on a property in the district. If an applied arts use occupies a space previously occupied by an office use, there shall be no requirement for an equal amount of other arts use on the property.

4. Office Uses. Any office use established on or before April 5, 1988, within a given tenant space may continue to occupy that space.

5. New Harbors or Marinas. No new recreational marinas or harbors may be constructed or developed in the zoning districts subject to the -M overlay designation. New marine service harbors may be constructed or developed in accordance with the provisions of this section.

6. Existing Harbors and Marinas. Existing recreational marinas and harbors may be remodeled and realigned with the issuance of a design review permit, consistent with the provisions of Chapter 10.54 SMC (Design Review Procedures). Enlargement of existing recreational marinas and harbors may take place with the issuance of a conditional use permit consistent with Chapter 10.60 SMC (Conditional Use Permits). Enlargement shall not exceed 10 percent of existing berths at the time of application of the conditional use permit.

7. Ferry Terminal. No ferry or similar marine transportation shall be located in the marinship overlay district.

E. Development Standards. All lands within the boundaries of the -M overlay district are subject to the development standards established by this section and shown in Table 10.28-1 (Site Development Standards – Marinship (-M) Overlay Zoning District). Any additional requirements applicable in the base district (IM, W, P, OA, SC, or H) or another applicable overlay district shall also apply. Additional standards may be established by the marinship specific plan and shall apply. Where development regulations conflict, the more restrictive shall apply. In addition, the following standards shall apply:

1. Applicability. Development standards shall apply to any new construction, redevelopment or exterior building remodeling involving at least 25 percent of the existing floor area or 25 percent of the market value of the parcel improvements.

2. Public Access. All shoreline parcels shall provide for temporary tie-up of small boats, as required by the City. The number of such spaces shall be a minimum of one per parcel or two percent of the total number of berths in the harbor, whichever is greater, unless otherwise approved by the City.

3. Dry Boat Berths. The number of dry boat berths shall not exceed 100 berths per acre.

4. Industrial Equivalent FAR. Allowable floor area is further limited in the W (waterfront) and IM (industrial marinship) districts for parcels with commercial development in excess of the allowable floor area ratio (FAR) for commercial use as of the adoption date of the marinship specific plan (April 5, 1988). The limitation shall be based on an industrial-equivalent FAR, which shall be calculated as follows:

a. Multiply the amount of the commercial development that is in excess of the allowable FAR for commercial uses by the appropriate factor below:

i. Office: 3.14;

ii. Retail: 1.91;

iii. Restaurant: 3.12.

b. Add the resulting number to the existing FAR for the parcel to get the industrial-equivalent FAR. The industrial-equivalent FAR shall not exceed the total FAR allowed for the zone. If the existing industrial-equivalent FAR exceeds the total FAR allowed for the zone, no new development is permitted. Existing uses may not be converted to more intensive uses if they cause the industrial-equivalent FAR to exceed the total FAR allowed for the zone. Here are two examples:

Example A: An existing office building in the industrial district contains 0.30 FAR. This would typically allow an additional 0.10 FAR to be constructed for permitted uses. As only 0.15 FAR is permitted for commercial uses, the remaining 0.15 FAR is multiplied by 3.14 office factor. The resultant 0.47 FAR is added to the allowable 0.15 FAR to get an industrial-equivalent FAR of 0.62 which exceeds the permitted 0.40 FAR. No further development is permitted.

Example B: An existing building in the industrial district contains 0.22 FAR for retail uses. This would typically allow an additional 0.18 FAR to be constructed for permitted uses. As only a 0.15 FAR is permitted for commercial uses, the remaining 0.07 FAR is multiplied by the 1.91 retail factor. The resultant 0.134 FAR is added to the 0.15 FAR to get an industrial-equivalent FAR of 0.284 which is less than the maximum 0.40 FAR. An additional 0.116 FAR may be constructed for permitted uses.

5. Building Height and Bulk. Building height should be compatible with surrounding developments, consistent with the marinship specific plan. Building masses shall be modulated in plan, elevation and profile to avoid monotonous form and character.

Exceptions are subject to the following:

1. Submittal Requirements. Application for an exception shall be filed with the Community Development Department by the applicant. The applicant shall submit all required data as listed below:

a. Documentation describing how the requested exception will conform to the marinship specific plan goals, the development programs for the marinship as a whole and for all parcels to be affected by the proposed exception, and the development standards.

b. An accurate legal description and a map of the land and any existing buildings.

c. Documentation describing the changed circumstances which warrant or require the exception.

d. Change in the number of residents, employees, patrons, or visitors in the area resulting from the exception.

e. Probable amount and type of traffic to be generated by the exception and the impact on the intersections with Bridgeway which serve the marinship.

f. Documentation describing how the proposed exception complies with the 1985 Traffic Initiative.

2. Exception Findings. In order to approve an exception to the marinship specific plan standards or definitions of use, the following findings must be made:

a. The exception requested addresses an implementation measure of the marinship specific plan and not a policy essential to achieving the goals of the plan.

b. The exception is needed to accommodate changed economic or operational circumstances affecting preferred uses described in the plan which were not or could not have been foreseen when the plan was adopted.

c. The exception furthers the intent of one or more goals of the marinship specific plan and the project is in substantial compliance with both specific and general regulations of the marinship specific plan and the underlying zoning designation.

d. The exception will not result in a significant negative impact on the traffic conditions in the marinship or on Bridgeway.

e. The exception will serve the needs of residents of Sausalito and employees in the marinship. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.28.060 Planned development (-Pd).
A. Purpose and Intent. In addition to the general purposes of this chapter, the specific purpose of the planned development (-Pd) overlay district is to allow development areas with flexible requirements. Planned developments approved prior to the adoption date of this title are in the form of conditional use permits. Any additional development on such sites shall require a planned development permit. Projects proposed for other sites that require varying residential density, commercial intensity or other flexible requirements shall require a re-zoning to planned development overlay, shall be subject to a planned development permit, and shall conform to the requirements and standards of this section.

B. Applicability. The Planned Development overlay district shall be designated on the Sausalito Zoning Map by the letters “-Pd” followed by a number. The number shall indicate the existing conditional use permit that allows the development and the maximum number of dwelling units per acre allowed on the specific site.

C. Application. An application for a Pd permit may be filed with the Planning Commission as provided in Chapter 10.50 SMC (Land Use Permit Procedures). In addition to the data required by SMC 10.50.030 (Application procedure), the application shall be accompanied by the following data prepared by a design team consisting of an architect, landscape architect and civil engineer. The Community Development Director may waive the requirement for any specific member of the design team or for filing any of these listed data when not applicable to the specific project.

1. A site plan showing general locations of all streets, on-street and off-street parking, bicycle paths, riding trails, hiking trails, buildings, and other manmade structures; typical elevations or perspective drawings showing the relationship after development of the proposed buildings and the topographic features of the site; and a table listing land coverage by percentage and acreage for the following: Open space (intensely landscaped and natural), all streams, ponds and areas existing in riparian vegetation, coverage by housing unit or commercial structure roof, parking (covered, open, off-street), streets, sidewalks, paths, recreational facilities;

2. A topographic map showing existing contours and proposed lot lines which may be integrated with the site plan described above;

3. Any tree(s), including size and species as defined in Chapter 11.12 SMC (Preservation of Trees and Views), whether or not such tree(s) is/are to be removed or destroyed, on the site plan or on a separate plan;

4. Sufficient dimensions to show right-of-way widths, pavement widths, radii of curvature of centerlines, street grades, whether streets are to be public or private, and all proposed frontage improvements on new and existing streets;

5. A detailed landscaping plan showing the natural open space which will remain upon completion of development, all existing trees (and indicating which trees are scheduled for removal), and the precise boundaries of additional landscaping; the landscape plan shall include container size of all trees and shrubs, species of all plant material, irrigation system plan, street lighting, low-level path lighting, street furniture and fencing materials, dimensions and locations;

6. If the application includes residential uses, a statement in writing stipulating to the total number of bedrooms to be constructed; and

7. If the Pd permit application is for phased residential development of five or more acres, the applicant may initially submit general information relating to subsections (C)(1) and (C)(5) of this section for review by the Planning Commission. Precise and detailed plans setting forth the information required by these items shall subsequently be submitted to the Planning Commission for its review and approval prior to the approval of a tentative subdivision map, building permit, or other construction authorized by the Pd permit.

D. Notice and Public Hearing by Planning Commission. Upon determining that an application is complete, the Community Development Director shall submit the application to the Planning Commission. A public hearing on the application shall be noticed and held, as provided by Chapter 10.82 SMC (Public Notice and Hearings).

E. Findings. The Planning Commission may recommend approval of a planned development (-Pd) permit, and the City Council may approve a Pd permit, if the following findings can be made:

1. The approval of the plan is in the best interests of the public health, safety and general welfare;

2. The proposed plan is consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan;

3. The plan conforms to the purpose of the planned development district;

4. The uses permitted and the conditions of approval are compatible with the site and its surrounding properties and uses;

5. The use complies with all other requirements of this title and the Sausalito Municipal Code and the project is in substantial compliance with both specific and general regulations within the underlying district;

6. Specific site conditions or criteria, including location and physical characteristics, provide for a flexible approach to development standards, residential density or development intensity; and

7. Conditions applied to the project offset any impacts caused by alternative development standards.

F. Recommendation by Planning Commission. Following the public hearing, the Planning Commission may recommend to the City Council that the application be approved, conditionally approved or denied. The Community Development Director shall transmit the recommendation to the City Clerk.

G. Notice and Public Hearing by City Council. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Commission concerning a Pd permit application, the City Council shall schedule a public hearing on the application before the City Council as provided in Chapter 10.82 SMC (Public Notice and Hearings). A public hearing shall be noticed and conducted in conformance with Chapter 10.82 SMC (Public Notice and Hearings).

H. Decision. Following the public hearing, the City Council may approve, conditionally approve or deny the application. The decision shall be based on findings as provided by subsection E of this section (Findings). Any decision to approve a planned development permit shall be in the form of a resolution and shall be adopted with an ordinance rezoning the site. The City Council may approve the application subject to conditions which it believes, in its sole discretion, will make the proposed use consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan, or the -Pd zoning district, or which will make the proposed use compatible with other uses in the vicinity, or which will otherwise promote the public health, safety and welfare. The Council may also refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for further report and recommendation.

I. Permit Amendments. A Pd permit may be amended only by following the same procedures required for the issuance of a Pd permit. Minor deviations from the terms of a Pd permit shall be permitted and shall not be deemed amendments if the number of dwelling units is not being increased. Both the City Engineer and the Community Development Director shall determine in writing that the proposed development substantially complies with the Pd permit.

J. Overlay District Requirements. The requirements and standards that apply to land uses and new development within the -Pd overlay district shall be as provided by the approved planned development permit and as provided by Chapters 10.20 through 10.26 SMC (base zoning regulations) for the applicable base zoning district. Where the provisions of the planned development permit conflict with the requirements of the base zoning district, the provisions of the approved planned development permit shall control. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.28.070 Senior housing (-Sh).
A. Purpose and Intent. In addition to the general purposes of this chapter, the purpose of this section establishing the senior housing (-Sh) overlay district is to promote and encourage housing for senior citizens and handicapped persons.

B. Applicability. The senior housing overlay district may be applied to those areas which are designated as high density residential and zoned R-3 or are located in close proximity to shopping, public transportation, medical services, and public transportation.

10.40.010 Purpose and applicability of chapter.
A. Purpose. In addition to the general purposes established in SMC 10.10.030 (Title and purpose), the specific purpose of this chapter is to provide general regulations to guide the location, design and development of new land uses and structures and the alteration of existing uses and structures. The provisions of this chapter supplement and work with the development requirements of each base and overlay zoning district established by SMC 10.12.040 (Establishment of zoning districts). The illustrations in this chapter are supplemental to the text and serve to describe the development standards contained within the text. In the event of a conflict between the text and the illustrations, the text shall govern.

B. Applicability. All land use permits (SMC 10.12.050, Zoning clearance required) and subdivisions of land or air space (approved pursuant to SMC Title 9) shall comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.020 Development standards of the fair traffic limits initiative.
The following standards were adopted by a majority vote of the electors of the City of Sausalito on June 4, 1985 (full text in the appendix to this title). Included below, in italics, is clarification language adopted by Resolution 3407 of the City Council on July 16, 1985, and now made a part of this Zoning Ordinance. This section affects only the CN (commercial neighborhood), CS (commercial shopping center), IM (industrial marinship), CW (commercial waterfront), and W (waterfront), but does not affect the CC (central commercial) or any residential zoning districts. The CR (commercial residential) zoning district is affected only as provided in SMC 10.24.040(B) (New Development in CR District).

A. Findings and Purpose. The people of the City of Sausalito hereby find that it is in the best interests of the present and future residents of the City to reduce the increase in automobile traffic generated by new development in the City’s commercial and industrial zones and to preserve the maritime character of those areas by reducing permissible density in commercial and industrial areas.

This reduction is necessary to protect property rights and to ensure orderly development in commercial and industrial zones in the City in a manner that will not generate excessive traffic, air or noise pollution, nor diminish the public health and welfare.

B. Application of Standards. It is the intention of the people of Sausalito that the following policies govern the implementation of density standards and maximum floor area ratios:

1. Existing uses which are made nonconforming by this amendment shall be considered nonconforming under the provisions of SMC 10.62.020 (Applicability).

2. If on December 1, 1984, a parcel exceeds the maximum floor area ratio permitted by this amendment, that parcel may not be split into additional parcels in order to provide additional buildable area. This section limits the division of land parcels which on or after December 1, 1984, equaled or exceeded the maximum floor area ratio.

3. The zoning map of Sausalito effective as amended July 15, 1980, shall govern the affected zoning categories. No site may be redesignated to any other zoning classification that would allow greater density or floor area ratio. The term “categories” may be used interchangeably with the term “classifications.” The term “density” shall refer to the amount of floor area ratio as determined by the maximum floor area ratio column shown on the development standards table for each applicable commercial district. This section prohibits the redesignation of any site within the affected zoning districts to any other zoning classification from the list of classifications on the zoning map or any other zoning classification later invented, that would result in greater floor area ratio than presently attached to the site. No parcel reverts to the zoning classification that it bore on July 15, 1980.

4. Where a parcel is already developed up to or beyond the maximum floor area ratio, no conversion or change in use may be permitted when that conversion or change in use will result in increased commercial usage or density. The term “increased commercial usage or density” refers to the prohibition of increasing the allowable percentage of commercial use and floor area ratio above those indicated in the maximum floor area ratio column of the development standards table for each applicable commercial district. This section does not prohibit the addition or deletion to the list of permitted uses in each affected zoning classification; provided, that such a modification would not produce an increase in the amount of allowable floor area ratio that would have been permitted had the list not been modified.

5. In the CR zone, residential uses existing as of December 1, 1984, may not be converted into any other uses. This section limits the conversion of residential uses in the CR (commercial-residential) zoning district which existed on or after December 1, 1984.

6. The maximum floor area ratios identified for the CN (commercial neighborhood), CS (commercial shopping center), IM (industrial marinship), CW (commercial waterfront), and W (waterfront) zoning districts may not be exceeded by variance, conditional use, planned unit development or any other device. These zoning permits may not be used to increase the floor area ratio beyond the figures listed as the maximum floor area ratio in Table 2 of the initiative. Variances may be considered to modify required yards, height limit, required parcel size and building coverage; provided, that the variance does not result in an increase in the amount of development permitted by the floor area ratios in the development standards tables for each applicable commercial district. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.030 Minimum parcel standards.
Each existing parcel proposed for development or a new land use shall comply with the provisions of this section. New parcels proposed in a subdivision shall comply with this section and all applicable provisions of SMC Title 9 (Subdivisions).

A. Definition. Parcel area shall be defined as the net parcel area as defined by Chapter 10.88 SMC (Definitions).

B. Minimum Parcel Requirements. All parcels shall meet minimum parcel size standards for permitted or conditionally permitted uses unless otherwise provided by this section. The following standards shall apply to all new parcels proposed by any application for major or minor subdivision, planned unit development, and lot line adjustment:

1. The width of any parcel shall not be less than 30 feet at any point.

2. The average width of any parcel shall not be less than 50 feet. Average parcel width shall be the area of the parcel in square feet divided by the length, in feet, measured down the center of the parcel.

3. Street frontage shall be required for all parcels and shall not be less than 30 feet, as measured on the front parcel line.

4. To the extent practicable, parcel lines shall have a regular, unbroken alignment and shall intersect the street right-of-way as close to the perpendicular as possible.

5. To the extent practicable, parcels shall have a regular, rectangular shape and curved lines should be avoided.

C. Legal Nonconforming. Parcels legally existing on the effective date that do not comply with the minimum parcel sizes set forth in this title shall be considered legal nonconforming. Any lot in an R-2-2.5 district legally created prior to December 17, 1963, provided such lot has a minimum building site area of 3,000 square feet, shall be considered conforming. Nothing in this title shall be construed as requiring that a legally created lot must be merged or subdivided to come into compliance with the minimum parcel requirements set forth herein.

D. Development on Substandard Lots. A legally created substandard-sized lot (either width or area) for the applicable base district may be occupied by a permitted or conditional use, subject to the following:

1. Subject parcel must average at least 30 feet wide; and

2. Subject parcel must provide at least 1,500 square feet of net parcel area.

No substandard lot shall be further reduced in area or width, except as required for public improvements. Substandard lots under contiguous ownership are subject to the merger provisions of the State Subdivision Map Act.

A substandard lot shall be subject to the same setback and density requirements as a standard lot. One dwelling unit may be located on a substandard lot that meets the requirements of this section. The minimum parcel area per dwelling unit for two-family dwellings shall be 1,500 square feet.

E. Maximum Number of Dwelling Units. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted for any two-family or multiple-family residential site or planned development (Pd) shall be determined by dividing the net parcel area by the required minimum building site area per dwelling unit, as specified by the applicable zoning district. When the permitted number of dwelling units is calculated to a fractional number, any fraction of less than one unit shall be disregarded and be rounded down to the next whole number.

F. Exceptions. When considering applications for major or minor subdivisions, planned developments (Pd), and lot line adjustments, the Planning Commission may grant exceptions to the standards required under subsection B of this section (Minimum Parcel Requirements). Any such exception must be requested by the applicant, and shall fully state the grounds of the request and the facts relied upon by the applicant. In order to grant such an exception, the Planning Commission must find:

1. The proposed exception will permit development solutions more beneficial to the site and surrounding properties than could be achieved under the standards set above.

2. The granting of the proposed exception will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to abutting parcels or other property in the vicinity.

3. The proposed exception will not result in or continue an undesirable precedent, contrary to the intent of the general plan and Zoning Ordinance. [Ord. 1205 § 14, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.040 Floor area ratio.
A. Applicability of Floor Area Limits. Floor area limits for buildings and structures are established by Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 (Zoning Districts Regulations), 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements) and this chapter. New construction and additions to buildings shall not exceed the floor area ratio (FAR) limit identified in the site development standards table for each applicable zoning district (Chapters 10.20 through 10.26 SMC, base zoning district regulations).

B. Measurement of Floor Area. The sum of the gross horizontal surfaces of all enclosed buildings and any covered patio, balcony, court, deck, porch or terrace with over 50 percent of the surface of the exterior vertical area (not including the vertical area of the main building wall) enclosed by weatherproof materials (including closable windows, doors and louvers). Floor area shall be measured from the interior faces of the exterior walls and shall exclude vent, utility and elevator shafts; inner courts; 500 square feet of enclosed automobile parking spaces for single-family dwellings and the minimum area for parking and circulation required by SMC 10.40.110 (Parking space requirements by land use) and 10.40.120 (Design and improvement of parking) for all other uses; and shall include attics, crawl spaces and other confined spaces with a ceiling height greater than five feet 11 inches where such space has a finished floor. Interior volumes in residential structures with a finished floor to top of roof height of over 20 feet for sloped roofs (minimum 4:12 pitch) and over 17 feet for flat roofs shall be counted as 1.5 times the finished floor area. Continuous staircases (e.g., stacked) shall be measured as floor area on one floor only. Discontinuous (e.g., offset) staircases in residential structures shall be measured as floor area on each floor. See Diagram 10.40-10.

C. Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Calculation. “Floor area ratio” or “FAR” shall mean the floor area of the building or buildings on a parcel divided by the net area of the parcel. Floor area for basements where at least 50 percent of the exterior walls are subterranean shall receive a 50 percent discount. A maximum of 500 square feet of subterranean floor area may receive the discount. To receive this credit for subterranean floor area, the entire basement must be located within the required setbacks, and a deed restriction must be recorded stipulating that the basement area shall not be utilized for the creation of an additional unit on the property, and the project must comply with all other parts of this title.

D. Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Limits. The maximum floor area allowed on any parcel shall be determined by multiplying the net parcel area by the maximum permitted FAR identified in the site development standards table for each applicable district. Also see SMC 10.56.050.

E. Reserved.

F. Split Parcels. For parcels which are located within two or more separate residential zoning districts, the FAR calculation for structures within a certain zoning district shall be based upon the net parcel area only within that zoning district. Each portion of the parcel located within a different residential zoning district is treated as a separate parcel for determination of FAR entitlements. FAR entitlements within one residential district cannot be transferred to another residential district. This rule shall not apply in commercial districts for development associated with an approved master plan.

G. Industrial-Equivalent FAR Requirements (Marinship Specific Plan). See SMC 10.28.050(E)(4). [Ord. 1205 §§ 15 – 17, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.050 Building coverage limits.
A. Applicability of Coverage Limits. Coverage limits for buildings and structures are established by Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 (Zoning Districts Regulations), 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements) and this chapter. No building or buildings shall be constructed or enlarged so as to cover a greater percentage of the parcel than the building coverage limit identified in the site development standards table for each applicable zoning district.

B. Measurement of Coverage. Coverage is measured as the percentage of the total site area occupied by buildings and structures. For the purposes of this definition, “buildings” include primary buildings, garages, carports, and accessory buildings; decks and paved areas (such as walkways, driveways, patios, uncovered parking areas or roads) that have an elevation of at least two feet above the average level of the natural grade directly below the constructed feature (average of highest and lowest points); and stairs two feet above the natural grade. The measurement of site coverage shall not include the portion of roof eaves and/or rain gutters that extend no more than two feet six inches from the face of the building wall, but shall include the portion of roof eaves and/or rain gutters that extend more than two feet six inches from the face of the building wall. Also see SMC 10.56.050.

C. Limit on Decks and Impervious Surfaces. All structures which count toward building coverage shall also count as impervious surface. In addition, impervious surface shall consist of any of the following features, regardless of height relative to natural grade: (1) all paved surfaces, such as concrete, regardless of the permeability of the material; (2) all hardscape garden elements such as stepping stones, fountains, statuary, swimming pools, and walls; (3) all deck areas regardless of the material used for the deck structure; (4) all gravel areas. See Diagram 10.40-1. The following features shall not be counted toward impervious surface: (1) landscaped areas; (2) planters; (3) unlandscaped areas of exposed earth, including those between different impervious surfaces (such as stepping stones) or between impervious surfaces and landscaped areas (such as the area between a walkway and a landscaped area). Impervious surfaces shall be subject to the maximum area specified in Table 10.22-2 (Site Development Standards – Residential Zoning Districts).

D. Reserved.

E. Split Parcels. For parcels which are located within two or more separate zoning districts, the coverage calculation for structures within a certain zoning district shall be based upon the net parcel area only within that zoning district. Each portion of the parcel located within a different zoning district is treated as a separate parcel for determination of coverage entitlements. Coverage entitlements within one district cannot be transferred to another district. [Ord. 1205 §§ 18, 19, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.060 Height requirements.
A. Applicability of Height Limits. Height limits for buildings and structures are established by Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 (Zoning Districts Regulations), 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements) and this chapter. No building or structure shall be constructed or altered to exceed the height limit established by this chapter, except as otherwise provided by this section.

B. Measurement of Height. All portions of a building (including any portion of a floor, chimney or other appurtenance) shall be limited to 32 feet in height within the first 15 feet from the property line, as measured from the centerline of the paved portion of the road opposite the midpoint of the front parcel line. In addition, all structures shall be subject to the height restrictions identified below and the height restrictions specified in the appropriate zoning district, provided under no circumstances shall the height of any point of a building to the natural grade directly below exceed 50 feet.

1. Standard Building Height. Building height is the vertical distance from the average level of the natural ground surface under the building to the highest point of the building or structure. To determine the height of a building, the highest and lowest points of contact with the natural grade are identified and the average of these two elevations is the point from which the permitted maximum height is measured. The highest and lowest points of contact are determined where the maximum vertical projections of the perimeter walls of the building contact the natural grade. Where more than one structure is proposed for construction, the permitted height shall be individually computed for each detached structure. Balconies, decks and similar appurtenances and projections shall not be included in measuring the primary structure’s building height.

2. Over Water or Flood Zone. Maximum height of buildings located over water or within the V1 flood zone as identified in the FIRM (National Flood Insurance Rate Map) of the National Flood Insurance Program shall be measured above the natural grade or six feet above NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum), whichever is higher. The height of floating structures shall be measured from three feet above the waterline. See Diagram 10.40-2.

3. Building Appurtenances. Balconies, decks and similar appurtenances and projections shall not extend beyond a line measured from the high point of the building face on which the appurtenance is located and parallel with the degree of slope based upon the highest and lowest point of contact of the structure which it serves. When open balconies, decks and similar appurtenances are enclosed on existing structures and the newly calculated building height exceeds the height allowed by this title, this excessive height is permitted subject to the following conditions:

a. The proposed enclosures do not violate any other provisions of this title;

b. The roofline of the new addition is no higher than the roofline of the existing building;

c. The proposed enclosure is subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission as governed by Chapter 10.54 SMC (Design Review Procedures).

C. Sloped and Level Parcels. In addition to the provisions contained in subsection B of this section (Measurement of Height), height restrictions shall apply to all sloped (uphill and downhill) and level lots, as the lots are sloped from abutting streets. For lots that abut more than one street, more than one restriction will apply. The Community Development Director shall review and make a determination for proposals that do not meet the site conditions described below:

1. Uphill. Any slope greater than 10 degrees slope computed upward from a parcel line that abuts a street at the front of the property to the rear of the property. On the uphill side of a street, a sloped roof that exceeds the height restriction identified in subsection B of this section (Measurement of Height) may be permitted subject to the following conditions (see Diagram 10.40-4):

a. The roof slopes to meet a front wall of less than 32 feet toward the front property line, measured as stated above;

b. The maximum height within the first 15 feet does not exceed 40 feet; and

c. The sloped roof is subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission as governed by Chapter 10.54 SMC (Design Review Procedures).

2. Level. Any slope between 10 degrees up and 10 degrees down computed from a parcel line that abuts a street at the front of the property to the rear of the property. On level parcels, no portion of a building, including any portion of a roof, chimney or other appurtenance, shall exceed a height of 32 feet, as measured from a point located at the centerline of the paved portion of the road opposite the midpoint of the front parcel line. See Diagram 10.40-3.

3. Downhill. Any slope greater than 10 degrees slope computed downward from a parcel line that abuts the street at the front of the property to the rear of the property. The following provisions apply (see Diagram 10.40-5):

a. Height Restrictions. On the downhill side of a street no portion of a building, including any portion of a roof, chimney, or other appurtenance, shall exceed a height of 24 feet, as measured from the centerline of the paved portion of the road opposite the midpoint of the front parcel line.

b. Exception for Parking. On the downhill side of a street, that portion of a building devoted to covering the off-street parking spaces and building access may project above the 32-foot required height limit subject to the following conditions:

i. The overall height of the structure and all appurtenances does not exceed 40 feet;

ii. The portion of new proposed structures exclusive of covered parking does not exceed the 32-foot height limit;

iii. The covering does not violate any other provisions of this title;

iv. The covered parking is the highest structure on an uphill lot; and

v. The covered parking is subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission as governed by Chapter 10.54 SMC (Design Review Procedures).

D. Exceptions to Height Limits. The height limits for buildings and structures established by this chapter are subject to the following exceptions:

1. Public and Quasi-Public Buildings and Structures. In districts in which a lower height limit is established, places of assembly in schools, religious institutions, and other permitted public and semi-public buildings may be erected to a height not exceeding 45 feet above average grade subject to the following conditions:

a.  The minimum side yard setback shall be increased one foot for each two feet such structure exceeds 32 feet in height.

b. The minimum rear yard setback shall be increased one foot for each four feet such building exceeds 32 feet in height.

c. Other architectural features (i.e., steeples, spires, chimneys, vents, etc.) may exceed the 45-foot height limit, subject to design review.

d. The height exception is subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission as governed by Chapter 10.54 SMC (Design Review Procedures).

e. The Planning Commission finds the proposed building includes special architectural features that contribute to the community’s character, while meeting the overall purpose of height restrictions.

2. Utility Poles. Power distribution poles and lines may exceed the height limits established for the zoning district provided they do not exceed a height of 40 feet unless a greater height is authorized under the terms of a conditional use permit as provided in Chapter 10.60 SMC (Conditional Use Permits).

3. Architectural Features. Chimneys, vents, and smokestacks may exceed the 32-foot height limit only to the minimum extent required by SMC Title 8 (Buildings and Construction).

4. Freestanding Structures. A conditional use permit shall be required for fire towers, commercial radio, and television towers, water towers and tanks, flag poles, power transmission towers, lines and poles, elevator towers, and similar structures and necessary mechanical appurtenances built and used to a greater height limit than that established for the applicable district. No such exception shall cover, at any level, more than five percent of the parcel nor exceed 1,600 square feet at the base. No tower, spire or similar structure shall contain floor area for commercial or residential use. Wireless communications facilities, as defined in Chapter 10.88 SMC (Definitions), shall be governed by Chapter 10.45 SMC (Standards and Criteria for Wireless Communications Facilities) except that in the event Chapter 10.45 SMC (Standards and Criteria for Wireless Communications Facilities) is silent regarding a specific regulation or requirement, the applicable zoning regulation from this title shall govern. [Ord. 1205 §§ 20, 21, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.070 Setbacks and yards.
Each zoning district establishes minimum setback requirements. Special situations exist where setbacks will be applied differently or must be increased. This section addresses these special situations. A setback provided around any building to comply with provisions of this chapter shall not be considered a yard or setback for any other building.

A. Purpose. In addition to the general purposes of this title and this Chapter 10.40 SMC (General Development Regulations), the specific purposes of this section are as follows:

1. To provide light and open space between structures on the same and adjoining lots;

2. To provide open space between structures and adjoining pedestrian ways;

3. To increase setbacks and provide visual relief along property lines with long, unbroken walls; and

4. To provide flexibility in the application of setback requirements.

B. Land Locked Parcel. Any parcel that does not have a front parcel line (i.e., not fronting on a public street or road) shall provide the required rear yard along one parcel line and the required side yard along all remaining parcel lines. If a rear parcel line has not already been established, the owner may elect any parcel line as the rear parcel line provided such choice is not injurious to adjacent properties, as determined by the Community Development Director. If a rear parcel line has already been established, the owner may elect a new parcel line as the rear parcel line, provided such choice is not injurious to adjacent properties, as determined by the Community Development Director. See Diagram 10.40-6.

C. Parcels Fronting on More Than One Street. The following setbacks shall apply for parcels abutting more than one public street or right-of-way measuring 50 feet or more in width (whether or not developed) (see Diagram 10.40-7):

1. No setback shall be required from parcel lines adjoining two intersecting public streets or rights-of-way.

2. Setbacks may be decreased for parcels fronting on two non-intersecting streets, or for parcels fronting on more than two intersecting streets, provided the proposal is subject to design review and the Planning Commission finds the reduced setback does not diminish the overall purpose of providing physical and visual space between residences.

D. Required Increase of Setbacks. Setbacks will be increased in the following instances:

1. Length of Building. The length of a structure shall be measured along a line parallel to the adjoining side lot line. Where the length of a structure, building wall, or series of attached building walls exceeds 40 feet measured parallel to the adjoining side lot line, the minimum setback shall be increased at the rate of one foot for each five feet such length exceeds 40 feet. The full length of the building shall be subject to the increased setback. If the addition will increase the building length to exceed 40 feet, only the addition shall require the additional side yard setback. The full length of the addition shall be subject to the increased setback. See Diagram 10.40-8.

2. Entrance to Dwelling from Side Yard. Where access to the main or secondary entrance of any two-family dwellings or multiple-family dwellings, group houses, court apartments or row dwellings is from the side yard, the minimum side yard setback shall be increased by one foot for each applicable dwelling unit. Such increase need not exceed five feet.

3. Creek Setbacks. No structures of any kind, other than stairs and pathways on grade and/or retaining walls for slope stabilization purposes, shall be located within 20 feet of the 100-year flood elevation line of an open natural drainage way or wetland (i.e., creek) identified on Map GP-14 of the environmental quality element of the general plan. Additional setbacks from creeks and wetland areas may be required as part of the environmental review process pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, as applicable. Also, in the course of design review, the Planning Commission may determine that additional setbacks from watercourses are necessary to ensure consistency with relevant policies contained in the environmental quality element of the general plan.

E. Special Setbacks.

1. Purpose. Special building setback lines are established along designated streets, pedestrian and other public ways to provide space for light, air, safety, circulation, and visual amenity.

2. Applicability. Structures adjacent to the streets, pedestrian ways and other public ways designated below shall be subject to the corresponding special building setback line. In any district where the yard requirement is more or less than the distance set forth by any special building setback line, the distance established by the special building setback line shall apply.

3. Measurement. The location of a special building setback line shall be measured in feet at right angles from the parcel line of the subject property or the line of the street, pedestrian way or other public way adjacent to the subject parcel.

4. Special Setback Lines.

a. A 10-foot special building setback line is required on both sides of the following streets, pedestrian ways or other public ways:

i. Alexander Avenue;

ii. South Street from Alexander Avenue to Second Street;

iii. Second Street from South Street to Richardson Street;

iv. Richardson Street from Second Street to Bridgeway.

b. A five-foot special building setback line is required on both sides of the 20-foot future pedestrian way shown on the general plan for the marinship area, and lying between Coloma Street and Harbor Drive. [Ord. 1205 §§ 22 – 24, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.080 Exceptions to required setbacks.
The following setbacks shall apply in the situations specified (rather than those required by Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 SMC, Zoning Districts Regulations) and any setback requirements in Chapter 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements):

A. Narrow Parcels. The side yard setback requirement may be reduced to 10 percent of the lot width, to not less than three feet, for any substandard parcel that meets the criteria in SMC 10.40.030(D) (Development on Substandard Lots) and is less than 50 feet wide. See Diagram 10.40-7.

B. Pedestrian Lane Rights-of-Way. Where a side parcel line adjoins a right-of-way which does not contain a street and is 10 feet or less in width, the required side yard setback shall be measured from the center line of such right-of-way.

C. Accessory Structures. Accessory structures and buildings may occupy required yard areas only to the extent permitted by SMC 10.44.020 (Accessory uses and structures).

D. Temporary Structures. Structures that are temporary or can easily and readily be removed, have no more than 120 square feet of roof area, and are not permanently attached to the ground (including but not limited to surface utilities and storage bins), may be allowed within required setbacks for a period of no more than 60 days per year. [Ord. 1205 § 25, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.090 Permitted projections into required setbacks.
A. Use of Setbacks. No structure shall be permitted within any required setback area, except the following:

1. Underground utilities and the related aboveground metering;

2. Septic tanks;

3. Fences and retaining walls that comply with the applicable height requirements;

4. Signs pursuant to Chapter 10.42 SMC (Sign and Awning Regulations); and

5. As otherwise provided by SMC 10.40.080 (Exceptions to required setbacks) and this section.

B. Yard Projections. Projections into minimum yards shall be as follows:

1. The minimum yard setback may be reduced by up to 20 percent; provided, that at all times a minimum setback of three feet is provided, for the following features (see Diagram 10.40-8):

a. Cornices, canopies, eaves, or any other similar architectural features, not exceeding three feet.

b. Fire escapes not exceeding four feet.

c. Bay windows, balconies, and chimneys may project a distance not to exceed three feet; provided, that such features do not occupy, in aggregate, more than one-fifth the length of any otherwise unbroken section of wall of the building on which they are located.

2. The minimum yard setback may not be reduced for decks that are 24 inches or more above natural grade, porches, or other indoor or outdoor living areas.

3. The following features may project into required yards if the applicable height and/or coverage requirements are met:

a. Walkways; provided, that any walkway is not at any point more than two feet above or below the level of natural grade.

b. Decks, swimming pools and patios; provided, that the height of any structure does not exceed two feet above the average level of natural grade directly below the feature and at all times a minimum setback of five feet is maintained.

c. An uncovered stair and necessary landings; provided, that such stair and landings do not extend above the entrance floor of the building except for a railing compliant with the California Building Code.

d. Accessory structures if consistent with the requirements of SMC 10.44.020 (Accessory uses and structures).

C. Reserved.

D. Side Yard Structural Projections. Where a building wall is not parallel to a parcel line, or does not follow a continuous unbroken alignment, a portion of the building wall may project into the required setback provided that:

1. The average depth or width of yard is at least equal to the required depth otherwise required.

2. No more than 50 percent of the building wall encroaches into the required setback.

3. The yard is not less than three feet in depth or width at any point.

4. The proposed side yard projection is subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission as governed by SMC 10.54.050 (Design Review Permits). [Ord. 1205 §§ 26, 27, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.100 Parking standards.
A. Purpose and Intent. The purposes of this section requiring off-street parking are as follows:

1. To minimize demand for on-street parking and alleviate traffic congestion and hazards to motorists and pedestrians;

2. To provide safe and convenient vehicular access to all land uses; and

3. To make the appearance of parking areas more compatible with surrounding land uses.

B. Type and Location of Parking Required. All approved land uses shall be designed and developed to provide the type and amount of off-street parking spaces required by SMC 10.40.110 (Parking space requirements by land use), and shall be designed as required by SMC 10.40.120 (Design and improvement of parking). All parking spaces required by this section shall be located on the same site as the use for which parking is required, except as otherwise allowed by SMC 10.40.110(E) (Joint Use) and 10.40.120(B) (Exceptions). The following requirements also apply:

1. Disabled Accessible Parking. Parking lots shall include disabled accessible parking spaces in the amount and manner required by Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Disabled spaces count toward the total number of parking spaces required by SMC 10.40.110 (Parking space requirements by land use). Parking spaces serving existing uses may be reduced in number to permit the installation of disabled accessible parking as prescribed by Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Existing structures and uses will not be considered nonconforming solely due to the loss of required parking for the purpose of establishing disabled accessible parking.

2. Bicycle Racks. Parking lots with 20 or more spaces shall provide one bicycle rack for each 20 parking spaces. Bicycle racks shall be designed to provide a minimum of four bicycle spaces in each rack and to allow a bicycle to be locked to the rack.

3. Accessibility and Usability. No owner or tenant shall lease, rent, or otherwise make a parking space required by this chapter unavailable to the intended users of the parking space.

4. Minimum Off-Street Parking. All off-street parking and vehicular access must be designed to result in a minimum loss of on-street parking and a net increase of at least one overall parking space (i.e., at least two off-street parking spaces must be served by a driveway where one on-street parking space is eliminated). Where only one off-street parking space is typically required, two off-street parking spaces shall be provided where one off-street parking space is lost to driveway access. Alternatively, the loss of on-street parking may be offset by frontage reconfiguration or improvements to maintain the existing amount of on-street parking. Any proposed reconfiguration or improvement to on-street parking shall be subject to review and approval by the Community Development Director and City Engineer. [Ord. 1205 § 28, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.40.110 Parking space requirements by land use.
The number of off-street parking spaces required for the land uses identified by Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 SMC (Zoning Districts Regulations) shall be as provided by this subsection, except where parking requirements are established by Chapter 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements) for a specific use.

A. Interpretation of Parking Requirements. The requirements in subsection B of this section (Minimum Required Parking) shall be interpreted according to the following provisions:

1. Uses Not Listed. The number of parking spaces required for land uses not listed in subsection B of this section (Minimum Required Parking), and that do not have parking requirements set by Chapter 10.44 SMC (Specific Use Requirements), shall be the same as required for the most similar use, as determined by the Community Development Director. The Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator shall determine the number of spaces required for uses not listed where a conditional use permit or a minor use permit is required, respectively.

2. New Buildings Without Tenants. If the types of rental tenants that will occupy a commercial, office or industrial building are not known at the time of land use or building permit approval, the amount of parking to be provided shall be:

a. The maximum number of parking spaces required for the most parking-intensive uses permitted by the zoning district and which the proposed building as designed can reasonably accommodate.

b. Determined by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission, when a minor use permit or conditional use permit is required for the proposed use.

3. Mixed Use Sites. Where a site contains more than one principal use (e.g., shopping center), the amount of parking to be provided shall be the total of that required for each individual use, except where a shared/joint use parking permit is secured as provided by subsection D of this section (Reductions).

4. Mixed Function Buildings and Storage Areas.

a. Where a building occupied by a single use (or separate tenancy rental space within a building) contains several functions, such as sales, office and storage areas, the amount of parking to be provided shall be as required by subsection B of this section (Minimum Required Parking) for the principal use, for the gross floor area (total area of all internal functions), except where noted on Table 10.40-1 (Parking Requirements).

b. When accessory storage areas associated with a principal use will be larger than 2,000 square feet, the required parking ratio for such areas shall be required as specified by Table 10.40-1 (Parking Requirements) for warehousing, instead of that required for the principal use.

5. Existing Structures and Uses. No part of this section shall be construed as requiring additional off-street parking for authorized structures and uses legally existing at the time of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title. Where any or all required off-street parking is not provided for such a use, that use may be replaced by a use requiring the same or less off-street parking. Parking required by the current ordinance which has been established for a structure or use shall not be removed, obstructed, or dedicated to other uses unless otherwise approved and authorized herein.

6. Expansion or Intensification in Use. Whenever the occupancy or use of any site is changed to a more intensive use and/or expanded in scope, additional off-street parking shall be provided as required by this title for the new use or expanded occupancy. Where the existing use does not provide all required off-street parking, additional off-street parking shall be required as follows:

a. Nonresidential. Whenever the occupancy or use of any commercial, industrial, or institutional site that is not in compliance with the off-street parking requirements of this chapter is intensified and/or enlarged, additional off-street parking shall be provided as required by this title for the new use or occupancy. For the CC and CR districts, increased parking shall be provided in the amount relative to the incremental change or expansion of use. For the marinship and CN districts, parking shall be increased for the entire expanded or intensified use.

b. Residential. Whenever the density (number of units) of any residential site that is not in compliance with the off-street parking requirements of this chapter is intensified, additional off-street parking shall be provided as required by this title for the new use or occupancy and for the existing use.

c. Nonconforming Uses. When a nonconforming structure is remodeled, replicated or expanded, parking shall be provided consistent with SMC 10.62.050(B) (parking for nonconforming structures).

7. Parking Calculation. The following guidelines shall be used to calculate parking requirements:

a. When the required number of parking spaces is calculated to a fractional number, any fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded and any fraction of one-half or greater shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

b. When calculating the number of parking spaces required for a specific land use, the gross floor area of any building and the gross land area of any outdoor activity shall be used. If a multiple-use building contains common areas, the parking calculation for those common areas shall be based upon the ratios of various uses in the building.

B. Minimum Required Parking. The number of off-street parking spaces required for new uses shall be based upon the type of land use, as specified in Table 10.40-1 (Parking Requirements). Where the tables of this subsection show more than one parking ratio for any use, the required number of spaces is the total of all ratios shown. Whenever subsection C of this section (Specified Land Uses) does not specify a required amount of parking spaces for a listed land use, off-street parking shall be provided in an amount adequate to meet the parking needs of all employees, visitors, and loading activities entirely on the site of the use.

C. Specified Land Uses. The following parking requirements shall apply to specified land uses:

1. Retail trade uses shall provide the number of off-street spaces for each separate retail trade use or rental tenancy in the amount specified in Table 10.40-1 (Parking Requirements), but no less than one parking space for each use or tenancy within a structure.

2. Transportation and communications uses shall provide the number of off-street spaces required by Table 10.40-1 (Parking Requirements), but no less than one space for each separate transportation and communication use or rental tenancy within a structure.

D. Reductions. The number of parking spaces required by Table 10.40-1 (Parking Requirements) and subsection C of this section (Specified Land Uses) may be reduced as follows:

1. Motorcycle Space Substitution. Parking lots with 40 or more spaces may replace one regular space with one motorcycle space for each 40 required spaces. Motorcycle spaces shall be a minimum size of three feet by six feet.

2. Mixed Use Projects. The number of required spaces may be reduced through the conditional use permit review and approval process in mixed use projects where it is demonstrated that hours of operation of different uses will effectively allow dual use of parking spaces.

3. Historic District Overlay. The number of required parking spaces for sites or structures within the downtown historic overlay district may be reduced consistent with subsection G of this section (Other Reductions), SMC 10.46.070(C) (Development Standards), and 10.46.070(E) (Parking).

4. Commercial Uses in CC and CR Zoning Districts. A common standard requirement of one off-street parking space for every 250 square feet of floor area shall apply to all existing commercial spaces and uses in the CC and CR zoning districts. All new structures or expansions of structures shall require additional off-street parking as listed in Table 10.40-1 (Parking Requirements).

5. Parking Exceptions for Small Units. For parcels that provide at least two units where at least one of the units is less than 700 square feet only one parking space is required for the smallest unit. This exception may only be applied once per parcel. Additionally, off-site parking may be allowed with a conditional use permit. In addition to the findings required by SMC 10.60.050 (Findings, conditional use permit), the following findings shall be made prior to issuance of a conditional use permit for off-site parking:

a. It has been demonstrated that it is not feasible to accommodate a parking space on the parcel;

b. It has also been demonstrated with a professionally prepared parking study that shows the availability of reasonably adjacent on-street parking during daytime and nighttime hours of on-street parking space equal to the amount of off-site parking spaces requested.

E. Joint Use. The Planning Commission may, upon application by the owner or lessee of any property, authorize a conditional use permit for the joint use of parking facilities by the following uses or activities under the specified conditions:

1. Up to 70 percent of the parking facilities required by this section for a use considered to be primarily a weekday use may be provided by a use considered to be primarily a weekend use. Up to 70 percent of the parking facilities required by this section for a use considered to be primarily a weekend use may be provided by the parking facilities of a use considered to be primarily a weekday use. Such reciprocal parking area shall be subject to conditions set forth in subsection (E)(3) of this section. The following are typical weekday uses: Offices, industrial uses. The following are typical weekend uses: Recreational marinas, waterfront activities.

2. Up to 70 percent of the parking facilities required by this section for a use considered to be primarily a daytime use may be provided by a use considered to be primarily a nighttime use. Up to 70 percent of the parking facilities required by this section for a use considered to be primarily a nighttime use may be provided by a use considered to be primarily a daytime use. Such reciprocal parking area shall be subject to conditions set forth in subsection (E)(3) of this section. The following uses are typical daytime uses: Banks, business offices, retail stores, personal service shops, clothing or shoe repair or service shops, manufacturing or wholesale buildings and similar uses. The following uses are typical nighttime uses: Theaters, bars and upper level residential uses.

3. In order to approve a conditional use permit for joint use, the applicant shall demonstrate the following:

a. There is no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the building or uses for which the joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed; and

b. The proposed joint use parking area is conveniently located to the uses to be served.

4. If the area to be used for parking and the parcel on which the subject land use is located are not the same, then the Planning Commission shall consider whether a deed restriction is warranted as a condition of approval. The deed restriction would stipulate that the shared parking agreement shall remain in effect for the life of the subject land use.

F. Reserved.

G. Other Reductions. A conditional use permit waiving or allowing reduced parking requirements may be requested and processed in accordance with Chapter 10.60 SMC (Conditional Use Permits). The Planning Commission may grant a conditional use permit if any of the following findings can be made:

1. The Sausalito Downtown Parking Survey and Shared Parking Model (by Robert L. Harrison Transportation Planning, September 1997, and updated February 2015, and thereafter updated) indicates that adequate parking exists in the CC district to support the new or expanded use; or

2. The new or expanded structure replaces a pre-existing structure; or

3. The new or expanded use allows preservation of an historic structure in the downtown historic district and does not require substantial alterations; or

4. There is clear and convincing evidence that the parking demand will be less than the requirement in this section. The Planning Commission shall consider survey data submitted by applicant or collected at applicant’s request and expense; or

5. Due to the design of the building or structure, its probable long-term occupancy will not generate additional parking demand. [Ord. 1232 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1217 §§ 8, 9, 2014; Ord. 1205 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1194 § 3, 2009; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

Required parking spaces and areas shall be located on site and designed as provided by this section.

A. Parking Lot and Parking Space Design and Layout. Except where otherwise provided by SMC 10.40.110(D) (Reductions) or subsection (A)(3)(b) of this section (Disabled Spaces and Ramps), parking spaces shall be designed as follows:

1. Parking Space Size. Parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet by 19 feet.

2. Location of Parking. Off-street parking facilities shall be located on-site unless authorized by a conditional use permit as specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section (Off-Site Parking) or SMC 10.40.110(E) (Joint Use).

3. Parking Lot Design. The design and layout of parking lots shall conform to the following standards.

a. Circulation Aisle Width. The minimum aisle width for access to parking spaces or between parking rows shall be as specified in Diagram 10.40-9 and shall be based on the angle and direction of parking spaces.

b. Disabled Spaces and Ramps. Parking spaces and access for disabled persons shall be provided pursuant to Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Location, design and amount of spaces shall be consistent with Title 24 requirements.

c. Border Barricades. Every parking area that is not separated by a fence from any adjoining street or alley shall be provided with a suitable concrete curb or timber barrier not less than six inches in height to block vehicle tires. Except for entrance and exit driveways, such curb or barrier shall be continuous and shall be located not less than three feet from such street or alley parcel lines and such curb or barrier shall be securely installed and properly maintained.

d. Screening. Every parking area of five or more spaces within and/or abutting any residentially zoned parcel or street parcel line shall be separated from such adjoining residential property or street parcel line by a solid wall, view-obscuring fence, or compact evergreen hedge six feet in height. Height shall be measured from the grade of the finished surface of such parking lot closest to the contiguous residentially zoned parcel. Where the elevation of the abutting parking area is below the elevation of the residential parcel along the common property line, the required wall, fence, or hedge may be reduced by one foot in height for each two feet of difference in elevation. The required screening and/or barricade shall be subject to design review approval per Chapter 10.54 SMC (Design Review Procedures). The Planning Commission may authorize further height reductions or elimination of such screening if it is determined that such screening would obstruct views or be detrimental to surrounding properties.

e. Lighting. Lighting shall be provided as required by project conditions of approval, or as deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission. Parking lot lights shall be designed to illuminate the parking area and shall be directed away from adjacent properties and any dwelling units.

f. Street Access. The location and design of all entrances and exits shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.

g. Internal Access. Unobstructed vehicular access shall be provided to each parking space except where a parking area is under the supervision of a parking lot attendant during the hours of operation.

h. Surface and Slope. Off-street parking areas shall be paved or otherwise surfaced and maintained to avoid scattering of gravel, rocks, dust, mud or other debris. Off-street parking areas shall also be graded and drained to dispose of all surface water. In no case shall such drainage be allowed across sidewalks. The maximum slope of parking areas shall be five percent.

i. Restricted Commercial Parking. Parking spaces in commercial parking lots may be restricted to customer and employee use only during business hours. In parking lots serving multiple uses, parking spaces shall not be restricted to time limits, specific uses, or “employees only” use, unless such restrictions are reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator.

j. Waterfront Parking. Structures and open parking areas in the marinship and central waterfront (as identified in the general plan and defined by Chapter 10.88 SMC, Definitions) shall be constructed no less than six feet above NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum), consistent with FEMA regulations and Sausalito’s local flood zone ordinances.

k. Ingress/Egress. All parking spaces (including garage spaces) required for any land use other than a single-family or two-family dwelling shall be designed and located to allow vehicles to both exit and enter the site in a forward direction to and from a public or private road.

l. Driveway Design. Driveways serving required parking shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer to assure negotiable break-over angle, turning radius, and slope. Driveways on nonresidential sites shall be limited to 15 percent slope. Residential driveways shall be limited to 20 percent slope. New driveways may exceed these slope limitations subject to the following conditions:

i. The conditions of the project site provide no reasonable alternative to reduce the driveway slope.

ii. The ingress/egress of the proposed driveway will not result in immediate or potential hazard to pedestrians and/or vehicles traveling in the public right-of-way.

iii. In no case shall a driveway exceed 25 percent slope.

iv. The proposed driveway is subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission as governed by Chapter 10.54 SMC (Design Review Procedures).

B. Exceptions. The following exceptions shall apply to the required design and layout of parking spaces:

1. Tandem Parking. Tandem parking shall require a conditional use permit as provided by Chapter 10.60 SMC (Conditional Use Permits). Tandem parking, two vehicles parked so that one is behind the other, may be permitted for two- and multiple-family dwellings where both parking spaces are intended to serve one and the same dwelling unit. Existing historical tandem parking spaces shall not be considered as providing required parking unless a conditional use permit is secured per Chapter 10.60 SMC (Conditional Use Permits). Tandem parking shall be a permitted use without the requirement for a conditional use permit for projects which propose the maximum number of units allowed for parcels in the R-2 and R-3 zoning districts. For the purposes of this section accessory dwelling units shall count toward fulfilling the density requirement.

2. Off-Site Parking. The Planning Commission may, upon application by the owner or lessee of any property, authorize a conditional use permit for off-site parking to serve a new use and/or structure subject to the following conditions:

a. If the required parking space(s) are located on a separate lot of record from the lot of record of the building, structure, improvement, or use requiring the parking space(s), a covenant shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Marin County, State of California. Such owner or owners shall record the covenant for the benefit of the City in a form approved by the City. Covenant shall provide that such owner or owners will continue to maintain such parking space so long as the building, structure or improvement is maintained within the City. The covenant shall stipulate that the title to and right to use the parcel or parcels upon which the parking space is to be provided will be subservient to the title to the premises upon which the building is to be erected. The covenant shall guarantee that the parcel or parcels are not and will not be made subject to any other covenant or contract for use without prior written consent of the City; and

b. The required parking space(s) must be located on an adjacent parcel or site that is readily accessible to the site containing the building, structure, improvement, or use requiring the parking space(s). [Ord. 1217 § 7, 2014; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

E. Floor Area Bonus and Concessions for Child Care Facilities.

1. When the applicant proposes to construct a housing development that includes affordable housing units as stated in Table 10.40-2 (Density Bonus Standards) and includes a “child care facility,” as defined in State Density Bonus Law Section 65915(h)(4), to be located on the premises of, constructed as part of, or located adjacent to the housing development, the City shall grant either of the following to the applicant:

a. An additional density bonus in an amount that is equal to or greater than the total square footage of the child care facility; or

b. An additional incentive or concession that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.

2. A housing development shall be eligible for either the density bonus or concession described in this section once the granting authority makes all of the following findings:

a. The granted density bonus or concession would contribute to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.

b. The density bonus or concession would not have a significant adverse impact on public health, public safety or the physical environment to an extent which cannot be feasibly mitigated or avoided without compromising the affordability of very low income, low income and moderate income housing units. A specific adverse impact is a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that application was deemed complete.

c. The child care facility shall remain in operation for the same period of time in which affordable units of the development are proposed and required to remain affordable.

d. Of the children attending the child care facility, the percentage of children of very low income, low income or moderate income households shall be equal to or greater than the percentage of the dwelling units proposed to be affordable to very low income, low income and moderate income households.

e. The City shall not be required to grant a density bonus or concession if it determines, based on substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities.

f. A floor area density bonus for the provision of a child care facility may be combined with a density bonus granted for the provision of affordable housing units. The combined density bonus for any residential development shall not exceed 35 percent.

F. Incentives and Concessions.

1. In addition to the density bonus, an applicant who utilizes the density bonus provisions of this chapter may request one or more concessions or incentives. The number of incentives or concessions granted to the applicant shall be pursuant to the State Density Bonus Law, as set forth in Table 10.40-3 (Incentives and Concessions), unless the City makes the findings and rejects a request under the procedures described in subsection (F)(6) of this section pursuant to the State Density Bonus Law.

2. Incentives and concessions may include: A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural design requirements which exceed the minimum building standards provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the California Health and Safety Code, and which result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. These incentives (or concessions) are broken down into two tiers, with applicants encouraged to select incentives identified in Tier 1 before selecting concessions in Tier 2. Incentives with an anticipated greater level of impact are identified as Tier 2 and are less preferred, and thus require a higher level of review and approval by the City. The overall goal of this hierarchy is to choose concessions that reduce neighborhood impacts, further the project’s consistency with the General Plan, and promote affordability.

a. Tier 1 Incentives/Concessions (Review/Decision by the Planning Commission).

i. Reduced minimum lot setbacks;

ii. Reduced minimum lot sizes and/or dimensions;

iii. Increased maximum building coverage;

iv. Reduced common or private open space;

v. Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the residential development if nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of residential development and the City finds that the proposed nonresidential uses are compatible with the residential development and with existing or planned development in the area where the proposed residential development will be located.

b. Tier 2 Incentives/Concessions (Review/Recommendation by the Planning Commission and Review/Decision by the City Council).

i. Reduced parking (beyond the State alternative parking standards identified in subsection G of this section);

ii. Building heights that do not comply with SMC 10.40.060;

iii. Increased maximum floor area ratio (FAR);

iv. Other regulatory incentives or concessions (such as impacts to primary views that do not comply with SMC 10.54.050(D)(4)) proposed by the applicant or City which result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

3. Applicants may seek a waiver or modification of development standards that will have the effect of precluding the construction of a residential development meeting the criteria of subsection D of this section at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this subsection. The applicant must demonstrate that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the residential project, with the affordable units, economically feasible.

4. The denial of an incentive is separate from a decision to approve or deny the project as a whole.

5. The granting of a density bonus, incentives or concessions shall not be interpreted to require a General Plan amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary action for approval. If the base project requires discretionary approval, the City retains discretion whether to make the required findings for the project’s approval.

6. The City reserves the right to deny density bonus incentives and concessions requests if written findings are made based upon substantial evidence demonstrating any of the following:

a. The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or Federal law;

b. The concession or incentive is not required to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or for rents for the targeted units to be set at affordable levels as specified in Section 50053 of the Health and Safety Code;

c. The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon:

i. Public health or safety for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households;

ii. The physical environment for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households; or

iii. Any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.

d. Development is physically possible without granting a waiver of development standards.

G. Alternative Parking Standards. For density bonus projects meeting the criteria set forth under Table 10.40-2 (Density Bonus Standards), upon a request by the applicant, the City shall allow the following modified parking requirements:

1. Zero- to one-bedroom units – one off-street parking space per unit.

2. Two- to three-bedroom units – two off-street parking spaces per unit.

3. Four and more bedrooms – two and one-half off-street parking spaces per unit.

These spaces are inclusive of accessible and guest parking spaces. All fractions of numbers shall be rounded up. An applicant may use tandem or uncovered parking spaces to meet these parking requirements.

H. Design and Quality. Affordable units must be constructed concurrently with market rate units and shall be dispersed within the development. The number of bedrooms of the affordable units shall be equivalent to the bedroom mix of the market rate units in the development. Affordable units shall be of equal design and quality as market rate units unless approved by the City. Exterior architectural appearance shall not differentiate between affordable and market rate units. Interior design, finishes and amenities of affordable units may differ from market rate units, but may not be of substandard or inferior quality as determined by the Community Development Director.

I. Donation of Land.

1. An applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development who donates land to the City, as provided for in this section, shall be entitled to a 15 percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning district and the Land Use Element of the General Plan for the entire development. For each one percent increase above the minimum 10 percent land donation for very low income units described in subsection (I)(3)(b) of this section, the density bonus shall be increased by one percent, up to a maximum of 35 percent as shown in Table 10.40-4 (Density Bonus for Land Donations).

2. This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density allowed by subsection E of this section, up to a maximum combined density bonus of 35 percent if an applicant seeks both the increase required pursuant to this subsection and subsection E of this section. When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next larger integer.

3. An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density bonus described in this subsection I when all of the following requirements are met:

a. The applicant shall donate and transfer the land no later than the date of approval of the final tract or parcel map, or application for the construction of residential units.

b. The development acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred shall be sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low income households in an amount not less than 10 percent of the number of residential units of the proposed development.

c. The transferred land shall be at least one acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of at least 40 units, has the appropriate General Plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development as affordable housing, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure. The land shall have appropriate zoning and development standards to make the development of the affordable units feasible.

d. No later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or of the residential development, the transferred land shall have all the permits and approval, other than building permits, necessary for development of the very low income housing units on the transferred land except that the City may subject the proposed development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized by subdivision (i) of Health and Safety Code Section 65583.2, as amended from time to time, if the design is not reviewed by the City prior to the time of transfer.

e. The land shall be transferred to the City of Sausalito, or to a housing developer approved by the City of Sausalito.

f. The transferred land and the very low income units constructed on the land will be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units constructed consistent with this chapter, which restriction will be recorded on the property at the time of transfer.

g. The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed development or, with the approval of the City, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed development.

h. A bonus shall not be granted unless a source of funding for the very low income units has been identified not later than the date of approval of the final parcel or tract map, or application for the construction of residential units.

10.40.140 Inclusionary housing.
A. Purpose. Inclusionary zoning is a tool used to integrate affordable units within market rate developments. The specific purposes of establishing inclusionary housing requirements are as follows:

1. Implement State policy that declares that local governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to facilitate the improvement and development of housing and to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community, as stated in Government Code Section 65580.

2. Implement the housing element of the general plan, which calls for the adoption of an inclusionary housing program in order to expand and protect opportunities for households of all income levels to find housing in Sausalito and afford a greater choice of rental and homeownership opportunities.

3. Advance the City’s legitimate interest in providing additional housing affordable to all income levels and dispersed throughout the City, achieving an economically balanced community, by requiring construction of moderate income housing.

B. Definitions. The following definitions shall be used for purposes of this section:

1. “Affordable rent” means the total housing costs, including a reasonable utility allowance, paid by an income-eligible household, which does not exceed a specified fraction of the household’s gross income as specified in California Health and Safety Code Section 50053.

2. “Affordable households” means households whose gross incomes and assets do not exceed the qualifying extremely low, very low, low and moderate income limits established in 25 California Code of Regulations (C.C.R.) Section 6932, and amended periodically based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) estimate of median income in the County of Marin’s Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, and as adjusted by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (“HCD”) by family size.

a. “Extremely low income household” means persons and families whose gross incomes do not exceed 30 percent of area median income, adjusted for household size appropriate for the unit.

b. “Very low income household” means persons and families whose gross income does not exceed 50 percent of area median income, adjusted for household size appropriate for the unit.

c. “Low income household” means persons and families whose gross income is greater than 50 percent up to 80 percent of area median income, adjusted for household size appropriate for the unit.

d. “Moderate income household” means persons and families whose gross income is greater than 80 percent and does not exceed 120 percent of area median income, adjusted for household size appropriate for the unit.

3. “Affordable ownership cost” for an affordable ownership unit means a sales price that results in monthly total housing costs paid by an income-eligible household which does not exceed a specified fraction of the household’s gross income as specified in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5.

4. “Affordable housing unit(s),” “affordable unit(s),” “inclusionary housing unit(s)” or “inclusionary unit(s)” means a dwelling unit within a residential development which will be reserved for sale or rent to, and is made available at an affordable rent or affordable ownership cost to, extremely low, very low, low, or moderate income households, as stipulated in the provisions of this chapter.

5. “Applicant” means any person, firm, partnership, association, joint venture, corporation, or any entity or combination of entities that seeks City permits and approvals.

6. “Granting authority” means the Building Official, Community Development Director, Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, or City Council, as applicable, with the authority to approve a proposed housing development project.

7. “Household income level” means the gross annual income of the household used to determine whether the household qualifies as an affordable household.

8. “Housing Authority” means the Housing Authority of the County of Marin, a nonprofit public corporation, or another agency designated by the City, for administering the housing programs under this chapter.

9. “Housing costs” means a reasonable down payment and the monthly mortgage payment, property taxes, homeownership insurance, private mortgage insurance (PMI), when required, and condominium or homeowners’ association fees, where applicable, for ownership units. For a rental unit, total housing costs include the monthly rent payment and utilities.

10. Inclusionary Housing Unit. See “Affordable housing unit(s).”

11. “Income eligibility” describes household eligibility for an affordable housing unit.

12. “New unit” means newly built units on vacant lots, units built on lots after the voluntary substantial demolition of existing units, or the creation of additional dwelling units on lots with existing structures or buildings. A new unit does not include the enlargement or renovation of existing units.

13. “Resale controls” means legal restrictions by which the price of affordable housing units will be controlled to ensure that the unit remains available to affordable households over time.

C. Applicability.

1. This section shall apply to multifamily and mixed use rental and ownership projects of four or more new units.

2. Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall apply to any multifamily and mixed use rental and ownership projects of four or more new units, with the exception of the following:

a. A residential development project, including new units that have been issued a vesting tentative map or building permit prior to June 1, 2018; provided, that the applicable permits and entitlements have not expired.

D. Projects Subject to Providing Affordable Housing Units. The primary intent of the inclusionary requirement is to achieve the construction of new affordable units, as outlined in this section and as consistent with State and Federal law.

1. Multifamily and Mixed Use Rental and Ownership Units (Four or More New Units). Multifamily and mixed use rental and ownership projects of four or more new units shall construct affordable housing unit(s) as follows:

a. Affordable Housing Units. At least 15 percent of the total number of dwelling units within a project that creates four or more new units shall be made available to moderate income households.

b. Fractions. When the number of inclusionary units is calculated to a fractional number, any fraction of less than one-half shall be rounded down to the next whole number; any fraction of one-half or greater shall be rounded up to the next whole number and treated as a whole inclusionary unit. For fractional units of one-half or greater, the requirements of this section may be satisfied for ownership and rental projects through the provision of a moderate income housing unit which has fewer bedrooms than the market rate units. For fractional units of one-half or greater in a rental project, the requirements of this section may be satisfied in the form of a moderate income accessory dwelling unit.

c. Conditions of Approval. Any discretionary approval of new dwelling units shall have conditions attached which will assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Such conditions shall:

i. Specify the timing of the construction of the affordable units, the number of inclusionary units and the appropriate income and purchase price or rental restrictions, and amenities associated with each unit.

ii. Require an affordable housing agreement providing for long-term affordability, income certification and screening of potential purchasers and/or renters of inclusionary units, resale control mechanism and ongoing management of the affordable units.

iii. Contain a provision indicating that residents of affordable units shall have access to all common open spaces and recreational amenities available for the market rate units.

iv. An ownership project includes any housing project where the units may be sold individually. Where an applicant elects to initially rent all of the units in a residential ownership project, the affordable housing agreement shall require affordable rents for the affordable unit(s) during the rental period and sale to affordable households at affordable ownership cost if the owner determines to sell the units at a later date.

2. Alternative to Building Affordable Rental Units On Site. Where feasible, it is the preference of the City that the requirements of this section for rental units be met through the construction of affordable rental units within the project. Construction of affordable rental units within another site or sites within the City may be approved on a case-by-case basis through the City’s discretionary process, upon a finding by the Planning Commission or City Council that the construction of the required affordable rental units is not appropriate as part of the project, that approval of land donation or off-site construction will provide an equivalent or greater number of affordable units than would otherwise be required by this chapter, and that the proposal otherwise meets the requirements of this section.

a. Land Donation. Applicants may satisfy the requirements of this chapter by an irrevocable offer of dedication of land for construction of affordable housing within the City.

i. Identification of the land to be dedicated shall be accomplished prior to approval of the discretionary permit for the residential development project.

ii. In addition to any other findings required by statute, ordinance, or otherwise, any project approval for a land dedication shall include a finding that the land to be dedicated is not subject to liens, is served or proposed to be served by municipal services, including water, sewer, roads, electricity, telephone or other similar customary services, contains no unusual planning or development constraints, is appropriately zoned for the proposed density, and adequate financing has been identified to support development of the required affordable housing on the site.

iii. Land for affordable housing projects shall be dedicated to either for-profit or nonprofit affordable housing builders approved by the City, subject to an affordable housing agreement or other legal contract approved by the City Council that shall provide for the construction of affordable units and the long-term affordability, management, and maintenance of the units. The amount of land shall be at least as much as necessary to provide one and one-half times (150 percent) the required number of affordable units as stipulated in this chapter. Rejection of an offer of dedication of land under this section shall not relieve an applicant of the obligation to comply with this chapter through another means.

b. Off-Site Units. Applicants may satisfy the requirements of this chapter by constructing affordable units on another site within the City.

i. New inclusionary units not built on the site of the proposed original project shall be constructed simultaneously with market rate dwellings constructed on the original site, unless alternative arrangements are approved as part of the project approval.

ii. The City may approve off-site rental affordable units in lieu of ownership units.

iii. Where inclusionary units are permitted off site, such units do not count as affordable units for the purpose of receiving a density bonus.

E. Requirements for the Construction and Administration of Affordable Units.

1. Construction of Affordable Units.

a. Timing of Construction. All affordable units in a project and phases of a project should be constructed concurrently with or prior to the construction of noninclusionary units, unless the City finds that extenuating circumstances exist.

b. Design and Character of Affordable Units. The affordable units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the development, shall contain on average the same number of bedrooms as the noninclusionary units in the development, and shall be compatible with the design of the market rate units in terms of appearance, materials, and finished quality, except that, with City approval, the applicant may be allowed to modify the design and character of affordable units, if such modifications generate a greater number of affordable units than required by this chapter, or provide a greater level of affordability (such as to very low or low income households).

2. Administration of Affordable Units. The City shall contract with the Housing Authority or other designee to manage the rental and/or sale of the affordable housing units.

a. An affordable housing agreement shall be prepared in order to provide for the long-term affordability, administration, and appropriate management of affordable housing units.

b. As part of the affordable housing agreement, the Housing Authority shall have the authority on behalf of the City to: require guarantees; enter into recorded agreements with property owners; and take other appropriate steps necessary to assure that the required affordable housing units are provided based on the time frames established and are occupied by a qualified affordable household.

c. See subsection (E)(6) of this section for additional details regarding the affordable housing agreement.

3. Targeted Affordable Households for Affordable Units. Affordable units shall be offered to the following household(s) based on the bedroom count of the affordable unit:

a. Studio dwelling unit: one-person household minimum;

b. One-bedroom dwelling unit: two-person household minimum;

c. Two-bedroom dwelling unit: three-person household minimum;

d. Three-bedroom dwelling unit: four-person household minimum; and

e. One additional person for each bedroom thereafter.

4. Unit Pricing. All affordable housing units provided under this chapter shall be sold or rented at affordable rent or affordable ownership cost for applicable affordable households as stipulated in this chapter.

a. Affordable rent and affordable ownership cost shall be verified by the Housing Authority, or City designee. The initial sales price shall be targeted to households at the low to mid-range of the moderate income limits but income eligibility shall extend to households at the high end of the range of the affordable income levels.

b. The price received by the seller of an affordable housing unit shall be limited to the purchase price plus an increase limited to the least of the: (i) Consumer Price Index for the San FranciscoOakland-San Jose Area for All Urban Consumers; (ii) increase in the Marin County gross annual household median income, as established by the Housing Authority, since the date of purchase; or (iii) fair market value.

5. Terms of Affordability. Prior to approval of a final map or issuance of building permits, whichever is earlier, the applicant shall execute an affordable housing agreement with the City and the Housing Authority ensuring the continued affordability of the affordable housing units.

a. The affordable housing agreement shall be recorded on title and shall be binding on all future owners and successors in interests.

b. Affordable rental units and affordable ownership units shall remain affordable in perpetuity or based on the maximum allowable time frames established by law at the time of project approval.

6. Affordable Housing Agreement. Affordable housing agreements acceptable to the City Attorney and the Housing Authority shall be recorded against the residential project before approval of any final or parcel map, or issuance of any building permit, whichever occurs first.

a. The affordable housing agreement must specify the number, type, location, size, and phasing of all affordable units, provisions for income certification and screening of potential purchasers or renters of units, maximum rents, and resale control mechanisms, as applicable, including the financing of ongoing administrative and monitoring costs, consistent with the approved affordable housing plan and any affordable housing guidelines, as determined by the City Attorney.

b. The City Council, by resolution, may establish fees for the ongoing administration and monitoring of the affordable units, which fees may be updated periodically, as required.

c. The City Council, by resolution, may adopt affordable housing guidelines to implement this section.

F. Enforcement.

1. The City Attorney is authorized to enforce the provisions of this section and all affordable housing agreements, regulatory agreements, and all other covenants or restrictions placed on affordable units, by civil action and any other proceeding or method permitted by law.

2. Failure of any official or agency to fulfill the requirements of this section shall not excuse any developer or owner from the requirements of this section. No permit, license, map, or other approval or entitlement for a residential project shall be issued, including without limitation a final inspection or certificate of occupancy, until all applicable requirements of this section have been satisfied.

3. The remedies provided for in this section shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall not preclude the City from any other remedy or relief to which it otherwise would be entitled under law or equity.

G. Administrative Relief.

1. As part of an application for the first approval of a residential project, a developer may request that the requirements of this section be waived or modified by the granting authority, based upon a showing that applying the requirements of this section would result in an unconstitutional taking of property or would result in any other unconstitutional result.

2. A request for a waiver or modification shall set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the claim.

3. A request for a waiver or modification shall be reviewed and considered at the same time as the project application or any affordable housing plan.

4. The waiver or modification may be approved only to the extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result, based upon legal advice provided by or at the behest of the City Attorney, after adoption of written findings, based on legal analysis and substantial evidence. If a waiver or modification is granted, any change in the project shall invalidate the waiver or modification, and a new application shall be required for a waiver or modification under this section.

2. Sign Faces Counted. Where a sign has two faces containing sign copy, which are oriented back-to-back and separated by not more than six inches at any point, the area of the sign shall be measured using one sign face only.

3. Wall-Mounted Letters. Where a sign is composed of letters individually mounted or painted on a building wall, without a border or decorative enclosure, the sign area is that of the smallest single rectangle within which all letters and words can be enclosed. If the sign has borders, a decorative enclosure or is a combination of words and a logo, the area of the sign shall be measured as the area in square feet of the combination of flush, attached rectangles within which the letters, words and/or logo(s) can be contained.

2. External Illumination. The area illuminated shall be the minimum amount necessary to light only the sign. If the light sources are external to the sign or are otherwise physically detached from the sign, they shall be directed at the sign so that only the sign face is illuminated and they do not cast light onto other properties or the public right-of-way.

3. Illumination Control. At the discretion of the Community Development Director or Planning Commission, a lighting study may be required to determine the impact of sign lighting proposals on adjacent properties and the general public. Lighting systems for signs, awnings, and sign programs may also be required to include a dimming switch, timer or other device to allow a reduction of the intensity of lighting after installation if it adversely impacts residents or adjacent properties or is not in keeping with the ambient level of illumination on surrounding properties.

M. Businesses That Occupy More Than One Level. The maximum sign area allowed for any individual business or office which occupies more than one level in the same building, including any part of the ground level, shall be determined by combining subsections K (Ground Level Business) and L (Upper Level Business) of this section; however, the total size shall not exceed 50 square feet unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission.

A sign that has been approved pursuant to this section shall not be changed or replaced, nor shall any design elements of any building or lot where a sign is located be changed or replaced if any such design element was a basis for the approval of a sign, without a new sign permit first being obtained. Any change in the sign face copy to modify the business name or other information on the sign does not require the issuance of a new sign permit so long as the change is consistent with the Sausalito Design Guidelines and/or with any applicable provisions of the general plan, as determined by the Community Development Director.

Q. Discontinuation of Use. Any sign that was legally erected but is no longer used as a sign or the structure upon which the sign is placed has been abandoned by its owner, not maintained, or not used to identify or advertise an ongoing business for a period of more than 90 days shall be removed.

R. Sign Completion. The construction of an approved sign shall be completed within one year of permit issuance, or within such other time period specified by the appropriate reviewing body upon permit approval. If not completed within one year from the date of permit issuance, or other time period specified in the permit, the permit shall expire. No sign construction shall occur after the expiration of a sign permit until and unless a new permit is applied for and approved.

S. Exceptions. Exceptions to these standards, or interpretations thereof, may be granted by specific approval by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall grant exceptions from these standards only if the following findings apply:

1. There are unusual circumstances in regard to the location of the property or business, or the particular nature of the use, which preclude the strict application of standards.

10.42.100 Nonconforming signs.
A. Purpose and Applicability. This section applies to existing signs that do not conform to the provisions of this chapter.

Once removed, the City shall notify the owner, if possible, that the sign has been impounded and may be redeemed after payment of a charge which approximates the cost of its removal and storage. However, if the owner does not redeem the sign within 14 days of the date of notification by the City, the City may dispose of the sign.

i. There is no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the building or uses for which the joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed; and

ii. The proposed joint use parking area is conveniently located to the uses to be served.

iii. If the area to be used for parking and the parcel on which the subject land use is located are not the same, then the Zoning Administrator shall consider whether a deed restriction is warranted as a condition of approval. Said deed restriction would stipulate that the shared parking agreement shall remain in effect for the life of the subject land use.

b. Affordable units may be permitted to be smaller in aggregate size and have different interior finishes and features within reason from market-rate units. The interior amenities in affordable units should generally be the same as those of the market rate units in the project. Appliances need not be the same make, model, or type of such item as long as they are of good and new quality and are consistent with current standards for housing. Deviations between market rate and affordable units shall be described in writing by the applicant and shall require written approval by the Director.

c. Development and application fees, including plan check and building permit fees, shall be reduced to a rate of 50 percent of the adopted development fees for the affordable portions of the project. The fee reduction shall be calculated on pro rata basis by the Director.

4. Access and Facilities. Both market rate and affordable units shall maintain separate entrances from commercial and/or office uses. A minor use permit shall be required to deviate from the separate entrance requirement. In order to approve a minor use permit for joint entrance, the applicant shall demonstrate that the addition of a separate entrance is infeasible due to physical constraints. All residential units shall contain a separate kitchen and bathroom facility.

5. Exceptions to Requirements. Waiver of specific use requirements in this section pursuant to SMC 10.44.010(E) shall only be considered in the following two instances:

a. To allow for an exception to subsection (B)(1) of this section, which requires that all uses located above the first (street or ground) level of all existing and new structures shall be residential, to allow for upper level commercial uses. The expansion of an existing business within the same or adjacent site, or the allowance of small commercial uses (up to a maximum 1,000 square feet per parcel) may be special situations considered by the Planning Commission when evaluating an exception to subsection (B)(1) of this section.

b. To allow for an exception to SMC 10.44.010(E), which requires that affordable units provide a minimum of two bedrooms. To receive an exception from SMC 10.44.010(E), it must be demonstrated that there are physical site constraints which make infeasible units with two or more bedrooms whether affordable or market rate.

SMC 10.44.010(E) shall not be used to grant any other exceptions from this chapter except for the two instances listed above. [Ord. 1224 § 1, 2014; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

Figure 10.44.330(A): Floor Area Ratio Example on an R-2-2.5 Parcel 

Example: To calculate the maximum FAR for a single unit and additional units (as allowed) for a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 zoning district, the following steps would be completed:

Step 1: To calculate the maximum FAR for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 zoning district:

Max FAR = 0.65 – (((Total Parcel Size – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – (((5,000 – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – ((2,000/3,000) x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – (0.66 x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – 0.133

 

= 0.52 FAR

Step 2: To calculate the maximum floor area for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 zoning district:

Maximum Floor Area = FAR from Step 1 x Parcel Size

 

= 0.52 x 5,000

 

= 2,600 square feet

Step 3: To calculate the remaining floor area for additional units (as allowed) on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 zoning district:

Maximum Floor Area for Additional Units = Total Maximum Floor Area for the Parcel – Maximum Floor Area for Single Unit

 

= (5,000 x 0.65) – (2,600 square feet [from Step 2])

 

= 3,250 – 2,600 square feet

 

= 650 square feet

Therefore, the maximum floor area allowed for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 zoning district unit is 2,600 square feet, with a remainder of 650 square feet reserved for floor area for additional units on the parcel.

Figure 10.44.330(B): Floor Area Ratio Example on an R-3 Parcel 

Example: To calculate the maximum FAR for a single unit and additional units (as allowed) for a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-3 zoning district, the following steps would be completed:

Step 1: To calculate the maximum FAR for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-3 zoning district:

Max FAR = 0.65 – (((Total Parcel Size – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – (((5,000 – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – ((2,000/3,000) x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – (0.66 x 0.2)

 

= 0.65 – 0.133

 

= 0.52 FAR

Step 2: To calculate the maximum floor area for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-3 zoning district:

Maximum Floor Area = FAR from Step 1 x Parcel Size

 

= 0.52 x 5,000

 

= 2,600 square feet

Step 3: To calculate the remaining floor area for additional units (as allowed) on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-3 zoning district:

Maximum Floor Area for Additional Units (as allowed) = Total Maximum Floor Area Allowed for the Parcel – Maximum Floor Area for Single Unit

 

= (5,000 x 0.80) – (2,600 square feet [from Step 2])

 

= 4,000 – 2,600 square feet

 

= 1,400 square feet

Therefore, the maximum floor area allowed for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-3 zoning district unit is 2,600 square feet, with a remainder of 1,400 square feet reserved for floor area for additional units on the parcel.

Figure 10.44.330(C): Building Coverage Percentage Example on an R-2-2.5 or R-3 Parcel 

Example: To calculate the maximum building coverage for a single unit and additional units (as allowed) for a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 and R-3 zoning districts, the following steps would be completed:

Step 1: To calculate the maximum building coverage for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district:

Max Building Coverage = 50% – (((Total Parcel Size – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.15)%

 

= 50% – (((5,000 – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.15)%

 

= 50% – ((2,000/3,000) x 0.15)%

 

= 50% – (0.66 x 0.15)%

 

= 50% – 10%

 

= 40%

Step 2: To calculate the maximum building coverage for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district:

 

Max Building Coverage = Coverage from Step 1 x Parcel Size

 

Max Building Coverage = 40% x 5,000

 

Maximum Floor Area = 2,000 square feet

Step 3: To calculate the remaining building coverage for additional units (as allowed) on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district:

Maximum Building Coverage for Additional Units = Total Maximum Building Coverage for the Parcel – Maximum Building Coverage for Single Unit

 

= (5,000 x 50%) – (2,000 square feet [from Step 2])

 

= 2,500 – 2,000 square feet

 

= 500 square feet

Therefore, the maximum building coverage allowed for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district unit is 2,000 square feet, with a remainder of 500 square feet reserved for building coverage for additional units on the parcel.

Example: To calculate the maximum impervious surfaces for a single unit and additional units (as allowed) for a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 and R-3 zoning districts, the following steps would be completed:

Step 1: To calculate the maximum impervious surfaces for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district:

Max Impervious Surfaces = 75% – (((Total Parcel Size – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.075)%

 

= 75% – (((5,000 – 3,000)/3,000) x 0.075)%

 

= 75% – ((2,000/3,000) x 0.075)%

 

= 75% – (0.66 x 0.075)%

 

= 75% – 5%

 

= 70%

Step 2: To calculate the maximum impervious surfaces for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district:

Max Impervious Surfaces = Impervious Surface from Step 1 x Parcel Size

 

= 70% [from Step 1] x 5,000

 

= 3,500 square feet

Step 3: To calculate the remaining impervious surfaces for additional units (as allowed) on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district:

Maximum Impervious Surfaces for Additional Units (as allowed) = Total Maximum Impervious Surfaces for the Parcel – Maximum Impervious Surfaces for Single Unit

 

= (5,000 x 75%) – (3,500 square feet [from Step 2])

 

= 3,750 – 3,500 square feet

 

= 250 square feet

Therefore, the maximum impervious surfaces allowed for a single unit on a 5,000 square foot parcel in the R-2-2.5 or R-3 zoning district unit is 3,500 square feet, with a remainder of 250 square feet reserved for impervious surfaces for additional units on the parcel.

c. Open area.

d. Public recreational and parks.

e. Residential (wireless communications facilities are very strongly discouraged from locating within residential areas or at schools except in exceptional circumstances).

C. Historic Buildings, Landmarks and Districts. Wireless communications facilities are very strongly discouraged from locating within a site containing an historic building or landmark, or within Sausalito’s downtown historic district. Regardless of their classification as a local, State or national historic resource, buildings, structures, objects or properties shall be considered of equal historic significance with regard to siting wireless communications facilities. If a wireless communications facility is located within or on such a structure/building, the facility shall be subject to the criteria of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and shall comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines as amended, as well as any local guidelines for the treatment of historic properties and applicable provisions of the Federal telecommunications laws and the National Environmental Policy Act.

D. Preferences and Guidelines for Co-Location and Shared-Location of Wireless Communications Facilities.

1. Within any land use area, location preference for wireless communications facilities should be given to co-location and shared-location sites, when such siting minimizes adverse effects related to land use compatibility, visual resources, public safety, and other environmental factors.

2. Guidelines for Co-Location and Shared-Location to Ensure Proper Siting.

a. Antenna support and equipment structures shall be designed to consolidate future planned facilities and eliminate or minimize visual clutter. If appropriate, multiple antenna support structures may be approved rather than a single larger/higher structure.

b. Design of co-location sites should promote shared use among different users.

c. Facilities should make available under-utilized space for co-location of other antennas and equipment, including space for other carriers.

d. Leases that convey exclusive rights to a single user and preclude development of a suitable co-location facilities site should be discouraged.

e. Carriers shall notify other potential users of the proposed facility site so they can coordinate efforts to co-locate on the site.

f. For facilities not located on co-location or shared-location sites, a written analysis of the unfeasibility of such sites should be submitted.

E. General. The use of existing structures is preferred over monopoles or other towers erected specifically to support wireless communications facilities unless technical evidence demonstrates that there are no other alternative sites, feasible support structures, and/or the use of a monopole or tower would avoid or minimize adverse effects related to the view shed, land use compatibility, visual resources, and public safety.

F. Map and List of Locations. The City shall maintain a map and list of the location of all facilities permitted under this section and shall make this information readily available to the public through a combination of methods such as posting at the Community Development Department, posting on the City’s website, and placement in the public library. The map and list shall refer interested parties to the Community Development Department for permit and testing information. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.45.110 Electromagnetic field exposure.

10.45.160 Visual compatibility and facility site design.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the following visual development standards for wireless communications facilities is to address the visual aspects of wireless communications facilities and their potential visual impacts on the environment in accordance with 47 USC Section 332(c)(7), and for the City to be able to implement mitigation measures if it determines necessary. These visual development standards take into account the technical requirements of the wireless communications technology and the unique topographic and hillside characteristics of the City of Sausalito, e.g., technical requirements to locate antennas at a certain height and in a particular service area, or to maintain separation between individual antennas.

Wireless communications facility structures and equipment shall be sited, designed, and screened to blend with the surrounding natural or built environment in order to reduce visual impacts to the maximum extent feasible. Where it is not feasible, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation as to why it is not possible to meet these standards, and alternative visual mitigation such as extensive landscaping, including multiple trees planted around the facility.

B. Site Development Standards.

1. To the extent feasible, all building-mounted wireless communications facilities shall be sited and designed to appear as an integral part of the structure consistent with the architectural style and character of the structure or otherwise made as unobtrusive as possible. If possible, antennas should be located entirely within an existing or newly created architectural feature so as to be completely screened from view. To the extent feasible, wall-mounted antennas should not be located on the front or most prominent facade of a structure, and should be located above the pedestrian line of sight.

2. The colors and materials of towers, antennas, and equipment enclosures shall be selected to minimize their visibility and to match or be compatible with their surrounding background to the greatest extent possible.

3. Base stations, equipment cabinets, back-up generators, and other equipment associated with building-mounted antennas should be installed within the existing building envelope or partially or completely underground, if necessary to minimize visual impacts. If located above ground, the equipment shall be painted, screened, fenced, landscaped or otherwise treated architecturally to minimize its visibility from off-site locations and to visually blend with the surrounding natural and built environments. Equipment screening should be designed in an architectural style and constructed of exterior building materials that are consistent with surrounding, development and/or land use setting. Except in exceptional circumstances, in open space areas all base stations, equipment cabinets, backup generators, and other equipment associated with an antenna shall be placed underground.

4. In certain open space or hillside locations that would be generally viewed from a distance, facilities shall blend in with natural features including the existing or proposed tree canopy and minimize unnecessary silhouetting on ridgelines. Innovative design solutions may be appropriate where the screening potential of a site is low.

5. Facilities should not be located on historically or architecturally significant structures unless visually and architecturally integrated with the structure and in accordance with all local, State, and Federal regulations.

6. Facilities should be sited to avoid adverse impacts to existing views from City-identified significant public view corridors.

7. No advertising signage or identifying logos shall be displayed on any facility, except for small identification plates used for emergency notification or as allowed or mandated by local, State, and Federal law.

8. To avoid or minimize the appearance of visual clutter on rooftops, proposed facilities should, to the extent feasible, be located adjacent to existing rooftop antennas or equipment, incorporated into rooftop antenna or equipment enclosures, or otherwise screened from view. In addition, existing rooftop antennas and equipment should be consolidated where practical.

9. Wireless communication facilities should be the minimum height required to permit the services proposed for that location and should be located at the lowest elevation possible. In particular, facilities should be located below any ridgeline or other significant public line of sight or underground wherever possible. Carriers must demonstrate that facilities have been designed to attain the minimum height required from a technological standpoint for the proposed site.

10. Antennas and associated structures and equipment shall be painted to blend with the structures, vegetation, sky, or landscape against which they will be primarily viewed.

11. Where a facility is a new structure or increases the height of an existing structure, the total height of the facility shall not exceed 32 feet above the existing natural grade or the maximum height of the zoning district, whichever is more restrictive, unless the facility is determined by the Planning Commission to be suitably camouflaged, or unless the carrier can demonstrate that the height limit has the effect of prohibiting its service. In cases where the 32-foot height limit prohibits its service, the carrier may apply for a variance from the height limit. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.45.170 Exempt facilities.
Wireless communications facilities are exempt from the provisions of this chapter if they comply with general zoning and building codes, laws and regulations and meet one or more of the following criteria:

A. The facility is located entirely inside a building and only serves that building.

B. The facility receives and transmits communications within a single organization; provided, that transmitters are located at the principal place(s) of business and any external antenna exceeds the roof ridge line of the associated building by five feet or less.

C. The facility is temporary and operates for less than 28 days.

D. The facility has a marine radio operators license and an antenna that consists of a single vertical element less than two inches in diameter.

E. The facility is preempted from local regulation by State or Federal law. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

1. If, after review of request for a demolition permit, the Historic Preservation Commission determines the structure itself has historic, architectural or cultural interest or value, the Historic Preservation Commission may withhold approval of demolition for 180 days (from the date of Historic Preservation Commission action) or until environmental review, whichever occurs later. The 180-day delay shall be for the purpose of providing time to explore alternatives to demolition. During the 180 days, the Historic Preservation Commission may direct the Community Development Department to consult with recognized historic preservation organizations and other civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens, make recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or agencies, explore the possibility of moving one or more structures or other features, and take any other reasonable measures.

2. At the end of the 180-day period, the demolition permit shall be issued if the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, SMC 10.50.080 (Environmental review), and SMC Title 11 (Environmental Protection) have been met. [Ord. 1261 § 29, 2018; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

C. Development Standards. Exceptions to development standards (including but not limited to setback, height, parking, coverage, or floor area ratio (FAR)) may be granted for legal nonconforming structures. The Planning Commission may grant an exception if the following findings can be made:

1. The exception is the continuation of an existing condition and the exception will not exceed the deviation already existing on the structure.

2. The exception would be more in character with the architectural character of the structure than adhering to the standard requirements.

3. The exception would not be in violation of the State Historic Building Code provisions for health and safety, would not be detrimental to any adjacent property and would not be injurious to public health, safety or welfare.

D. Additional Uses. Uses that are not normally allowed in a base zoning district may be allowed in structures that are located in a historic overlay district or listed on the local/State/National Historic Register, subject to a conditional use permit (Chapter 10.60 SMC). The Historic Preservation Commission shall review and make a recommendation on the proposed use(s) to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall consider the recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission and the impact of adaptive reuse proposals on the integrity of the historic structure and the neighborhood.

1. Required Findings. The Planning Commission shall not approve alternative uses pursuant to this section unless the following findings are made:

a. Exception to land use regulations is necessary to permit the preservation or restoration of a historic or architecturally significant structure or site;

c. The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and any applicable State or local ordinances and adopted guidelines or other policies have been used to review and consider the proposed work;

d. A preservation agreement has been prepared and recorded specifying the uses allowed on subject property and preserving property from demolition;

e. The Historic Preservation Commission has considered the proposed use and recommends approval; and

f. A public hearing has been noticed and held in accordance with Chapters 10.60 (Conditional Use Permits) and 10.82 SMC (Public Notice and Hearings).

E. Parking. Uses in sites or structures within a historic overlay district or listed on local/State/National Historic Register may be eligible for reduced parking requirements, consistent with SMC 10.40.110(D)(3) (Historic District Overlay) and 10.40.110(G) (Other Reductions).

F. Written Agreement. The granting of any exceptions shall be conditional upon a written agreement between the City and the property owner that ensures preservation of the structure’s significant character. The agreement shall give the City the right to revoke the approval at any time the applicant has not complied with the conditions of approval. The agreement shall be recorded with the County Recorder.

G. Termination. The approval of exceptions from the standard code provisions for structures in a historic overlay district or listed on the local/State/National Historic Register is terminated when the structure is demolished, or when the structure is altered in a manner that destroys or diminishes the significant character of the structure. All benefits derived from approval shall be removed. [Ord. 1261 § 30, 2018; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.46.080 Enforcement penalties.

Restoration processes include the recordation of existing conditions in scaled plan, elevation, and section documents along with photographic records of all elevations and site features. Any action to enforce this provision may be brought by the City or any other interested party. This civil remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal prosecution and penalty and any other remedy provided by law.

C. The City shall have the authority to withhold a building permit for a site if the City determines that a property deemed a historical resource under Public Resources Code Section 21084.1 and Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15064.5, on the local historic register inventory, on the local/State/National Historic Register, or within a historic overlay district has been demolished or partially demolished without benefit of any required demolition permit. If the City makes this determination, the City shall also have the authority to record an affidavit with the County of Marin Recorder stating that no permits for any new development shall be issued on the property for up to five years.

10.50.080 Environmental review.
A. Additional Information. After an application has been accepted as complete pursuant to SMC 10.50.060 (Initial review of applications), the Community Development Department may require the applicant to submit additional information needed for the environmental review of the project pursuant to the provisions of CEQA.

B. Environmental Review Procedure. After an application has been accepted as complete pursuant to SMC 10.50.060 (Initial review of applications), the application shall undergo environmental review, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and SMC Title 11 (Environmental Protection). The review shall determine whether or not the proposed project is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act and if so whether a negative declaration or environmental impact report must be prepared.

This determination and the preparation of appropriate documents (including negative declarations and EIRs) shall be subject to the provisions of CEQA and SMC Title 11 (Environmental Protection).

C. Designated Historic Structures and Properties in Historic Overlay Districts. Projects involving the demolition or interior or exterior alterations of sites or structures that are designated on the local/State/National Historic Register or within a historic overlay district shall be subject to environmental review, consistent with SMC 10.46.060 (Property and review requirements). The Historic Preservation Commission shall review such projects.

D. Structures over 50 Years of Age and Subject to CEQA. When an application results in the alteration to the exterior or publicly accessible spaces of, addition to, or demolition of an existing structure that is over 50 years of age and subject to CEQA, or when an application involves new construction on a previously undeveloped site, staff shall review the structure’s or site’s potential as a historical resource, consistent with Public Resources Code Section 21084.1 and Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15064.5. The Community Development Director, or their designee, shall review the information submitted pursuant to SMC 10.50.050 to determine whether the property may qualify as a historical resource under CEQA.

1. Does Not Qualify as a Historical Resource under CEQA. If the Community Development Director, or their designee, determines that the property does not qualify as a historical resource, the decision shall be in writing and forwarded to the Historic Preservation Commission for final advisory historical resource determination to the decision-making body. If the Historic Preservation Commission finds that the property may qualify as a historical resource under CEQA, then subsection (D)(2) of this section applies.

2. May Qualify as a Historical Resource under CEQA. If the Community Development Director, or their designee, or the Historic Preservation Commission determines that a property may qualify as a historical resource under CEQA, the applicant shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at the applicant’s expense, a formal historic resource evaluation report. The historic resource evaluation report shall be compiled by a qualified professional who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualifications Standards for Historic Architecture, Architectural History, and/or History (36 CFR Part 61 Appendix A) and forwarded to the Historic Preservation Commission for final advisory historical resource determination to the decision-making body.

a. Report Contents. The historic resource evaluation report shall describe the property and building(s), list any alterations, and include a photographic record and description of the structure and its context. It shall address the age of the structure, evaluate its architectural and structural integrity, the historic significance of the structure, both individually and as a contributor to the City’s designated historic overlay district(s), and shall make a recommendation as to whether the structure meets the definition of a historical resource as defined in Public Resources Code Section 21084.1 and Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15064.5. The historic resource evaluation shall also provide an analysis of the proposed project’s impacts under CEQA and address conformance with the required findings for a certificate of appropriateness (SMC 10.46.060(F)).

b. Historic Preservation Commission Review. The Historic Preservation Commission shall review the historic resource evaluation report and, based on information presented, shall concur or disagree with the findings and make a final advisory determination of whether the property qualifies as a historical resource under Public Resources Code Section 21084.1 and Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15064.5. The Historic Preservation Commission may require additional analysis, including a peer review, by a qualified third party. If additional analysis is required, the applicant shall submit a deposit to the City for such analysis prior to review.

E. The Historic Preservation Commission shall provide the decision-making body an advisory historical resource determination when required. The decision-making body shall make an environmental determination consistent with subsection B of this section (Environmental Review Procedure). [Ord. 1261 § 9, 2018; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

No further application for a permit for the same or substantially the same use or project on the same property shall be filed for a period of one year from the date of denial of any design review permit, minor use permit, conditional use permit, nonconforming permit, lot line adjustment, condominium conversion permit or variance application unless the decision is reversed through appeal, pursuant to Chapter 10.84 SMC (Appeals), or the denying authority specifically states the denial is without prejudice. The Community Development Director may give permission for such filing if the applicant can demonstrate a substantial change of circumstances or conditions from those existing at the time of such previous denial. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.50.120 Implementation of permits.
It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to diligently proceed to carry out the conditions of approval and implement any approved administrative design review permit, design review permit, nonconforming permit, minor use permit, conditional use permit, lot line adjustment, condominium conversion permit or variance.

D. Findings. Subject to subsection C of this section (Public Hearing), the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may extend the expiration date of the approved administrative design review permit, design review permit, minor use permit, conditional use permit, nonconforming permit, variance, lot line adjustment or condominium conversion permit by one year if the following findings can be made:

1. No change of conditions or circumstances has occurred that would have been grounds for denying the original application;

2. The applicant has been diligent in pursuing implementation of the permit; and

3. Modified conditions have been imposed which update the permit to reflect current adopted standards and ordinance requirements. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

If found to be outdated or insufficient, such security may be required to be increased to guarantee the original condition for which such security was required. If the security is not provided within 60 days of its due date, such action shall be grounds for setting aside the approval and for a hearing to revoke the permit. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.50.200 Revocation of approved permits.
A. Cause for Revocation. The granting authority may revoke or modify any previously approved permit or variance, unless otherwise specified by this title.

Design review provides for review of the architectural and site plans of selected projects, as specified in SMC 10.54.040 (Administrative design review permits) and SMC 10.54.050 (Design review permits). In addition to the general purposes of this title, the specific purposes of this chapter establishing procedures and criteria for design review are as follows:

A. To promote the preservation of Sausalito’s unique visual character;

B. To preserve land values and investment through thoughtful architectural and site design;

C. To prevent the erection of unsightly or obnoxious structures, additions, alterations or signage;

D. To incorporate site considerations, adjacent uses, and area traffic circulation into the review of new construction or alterations to existing structures;

E. To minimize obstruction of public views and primary views from private property;

F. To minimize obstruction of light, air and privacy;

G. To minimize property clearing, excessive grading and destruction of trees and shrubbery; and

H. To provide for street and alley dedication and adequate maintenance and improvements to public rights-of-way. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.54.020 Applicability.
This chapter establishes thresholds for administrative design review and Planning Commission design review. Administrative design review permits shall be required and processed in accordance with SMC 10.54.040 (Administrative design review permits). Planning Commission design review permits shall be required and processed in accordance with SMC 10.54.050 (Design review permits). Properties designated on the local/State/National Historic Register and/or in a historic overlay district shall also receive a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to SMC 10.46.060 (Property and review requirements). No design review shall be required for projects that fall under the design review thresholds contained in this chapter. Minor revisions to approved projects are not subject to this chapter and are instead governed by SMC 10.50.180 (Changes to an approved project). [Ord. 1261 § 10, 2018; Ord. 1205 § 40, 2012; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.54.030 Guiding principles of design review.
In carrying out the purpose of this chapter with respect to the external design of buildings, the decision maker(s) shall apply the following principles:

A. Architectural control shall be minimal, ensuring that purposes and objectives of this title are met, individual initiative is encouraged in building design, and substantial additional expense is not required.

B. Good architectural character is based upon the suitability of a building for its purposes; upon the appropriate use of sound materials; and upon the principles of harmony and proportion in the elements of the building.

C. Good architectural character is not, in itself, more expensive than poor architectural character, and is not dependent upon the particular style of architecture selected.

D. The relationship of a building to its surroundings is of greater importance than the quality of design of the individual structure. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.54.040 Administrative design review permits.
Proposals that fall below the thresholds contained in subsection B of this section (Applicability), either incrementally or cumulatively over a three-year period, and meet or exceed all zoning requirements shall require a building permit, are subject to Chapter 10.52 SMC (Zoning Permits), and are exempt from design review.

A. Purpose and Authority. Administrative design review permits allow for administrative design review of selected projects where clear design review guidelines and criteria exist. Administrative design review permits may be approved, conditionally approved or denied by the Community Development Department. When administrative design review permits are requested in conjunction with one or more permits requiring Zoning Administrator review, administrative design review permits may be approved, conditionally approved, or denied by the Zoning Administrator. If a proposal meets the requirements of subsection B of this section (Applicability) and requires Planning Commission review for a concurrent application, the proposal shall be subject to design review, pursuant to SMC 10.54.050 (Design review permits).

B. Applicability. Selected project proposals require a lesser level of design review which shall be conducted by the Community Development Department (or Zoning Administrator where applicable). The Community Development Department shall review and act on applications which are made solely for the following classifications of projects, for which Planning Commission review is not required for another concurrent application, and for sites that are not subject to the provisions of Chapter 10.46 SMC (Historic Preservation) nor considered a historical resource under CEQA.

1. Additions to single-family or two-family (duplex) residences where the addition results in a setback from any adjacent structure on a neighboring property of less than 10 feet.

2. Additions to multifamily residences, commercial structures, and industrial structures which increase the size of the structure by less than 10 percent, not to exceed 300 square feet, and which are consistent with the architectural style of existing buildings on the site.

3. Replacement of awning fabric on existing frames with fabric of a different color or modified signage.

4. Any elevated structures wherein subfloor plumbing, utility ducts, or mechanical equipment is exposed to view from adjacent properties or the public right-of-way.

5. Driveways in required side yard open spaces if not a part of an application which requires review by the Planning Commission.

6. Encroachment agreements (improvements in the public right-of-way) for the following items, if not part of other improvements requiring design review:

a. Major landscaping;

b. Stairs not on grade;

c. Driveways involving cut or fill of more than six feet;

d. Fences not exceeding 42 inches in height; and

e. Retaining walls not exceeding six feet in height.

7. Signs and awnings consistent with criteria developed by the Planning Commission and City Council as adopted by resolution.

8. Installation or reconstruction, other than repairing and re-striping, of a parking area of five or more spaces.

9. Capital improvement projects appropriate for staff review, as determined by the Planning Commission review of the annual capital improvement program.

10. Application for building permits for the construction, renovation or extension of any pier or dock, or application to establish floats or dolphins, for private pleasure craft in the R-2-2.5 zoning district.

11. Application for zoning permits for all buildings, decks, yards, and other improvements proposing a change in existing grade by cutting or filling greater than six feet in height.

12. Applications to construct fences that require the issuance of a building permit.

13. Applications to construct terraced or multiple retaining walls or slope stabilization projects that retain an aggregate of six feet or more of slope within any 10-foot horizontal interval.

14. Applications to construct vehicular traffic safety guardrails deemed necessary by the City Engineer.

15. Applications for properties identified on the local historic resources inventory proposing the following scopes of work require an administrative design review permit:

a. Demolition or removal of nonoriginal features of a building or site, including, but not limited to, additions, garages, and accessory structures.

b. Replacement of incompatible, previously replaced windows, doors or facade siding material if the replacement material is not compatible in appearance, color and profile to the existing or original material.

C. Public Notice and Hearing. Design review permit applications require public hearing by the Planning Commission. Public hearing shall be noticed and conducted consistent with Chapter 10.82 SMC (Public Notice and Hearings). Design review for signs and awnings shall not be subject to the noticing requirement.

D. Findings. The Planning Commission shall approve design review permit applications only if the following findings can be made:

1. The proposed project is consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plans, any applicable design guidelines, and this chapter. (The adopted historic design guidelines can be found in the Community Development Department or the office of the City Clerk.)

2. The proposed architecture and site design complements the surrounding neighborhood and/or district by either:

a. Maintaining the prevailing design character of the neighborhood and/or district; or

b. Introducing a distinctive and creative solution which takes advantage of the unique characteristics of the site and contributes to the design diversity of Sausalito.

3. The proposed project is consistent with the general scale of structures and buildings in the surrounding neighborhood and/or district.

4. The proposed project has been located and designed to minimize obstruction of public views and primary views from private property.

5. The proposed project will not result in a prominent building profile (silhouette) above a ridgeline.

6. The proposed landscaping provides appropriate visual relief, complements the buildings and structures on the site, and provides an attractive environment for the enjoyment of the public.

7. The design and location of buildings provide adequate light and air for the project site, adjacent properties, and the general public.

8. Exterior lighting, mechanical equipment, and chimneys are appropriately designed and located to minimize visual, noise, and air quality impacts to adjacent properties and the general public.

9. The project provides a reasonable level of privacy to the site and adjacent properties, taking into consideration the density of the neighborhood, by appropriate landscaping, fencing, and window, deck and patio configurations.

10. Proposed entrances, exits, internal circulation, and parking spaces are configured to provide an appropriate level of traffic safety and ease of movement.

11. The proposed design preserves protected trees and significant natural features on the site to a reasonable extent and minimizes site degradation from construction activities and other potential impacts.

12. The project site is consistent with the guidelines for heightened review for projects which exceed 80 percent of the maximum allowed floor area ratio and/or site coverage, as specified in subsection E of this section (Heightened Review Findings).

13. The project has been designed to ensure on-site structures do not crowd or overwhelm structures on neighboring properties. Design techniques to achieve this may include, but are not limited to: stepping upper levels back from the first level, incorporating facade articulations and divisions (such as building wall offsets), and using varying rooflines.

E. Heightened Review Findings. The site development standards contained in Table 10.22-2 are not entitlements; the approved size, setbacks or other physical conditions of a proposed new home or expansion of an existing home subject to design review shall be at the discretion of the Planning Commission. In order to meet the findings of design review, including the following heightened review findings, the Planning Commission may approve a home smaller, or with greater setbacks, or otherwise impose requirements that are more restrictive than those set forth in this chapter. For residential projects that require a discretionary design review (either administrative design review or a design review permit) and exceed 80 percent of the permitted floor area ratio (FAR) and/or building coverage limitations, the decision-making body must determine whether or not the site can support maximum build-out, consistent with the following:

1. Proposed development of the site maximizes preservation of protected trees.

2. The site is configured with adequate width and depth to provide yard spaces and setbacks, proportional to the size of the structure.

3. The site will be developed in a manner that minimizes the obstruction of views from surrounding properties and public vantage points, with particular care taken to protect primary views.

4. The proposed development of the site presents no potential hazard to public safety in terms of vehicle traffic, pedestrian circulation, slope and tree stability, runoff, and public utilities.

5. The slope and topography of the site allow for limited excavation and minimal alteration to the site topography outside the footprint of structures.

6. The site will provide adequate guest parking either on site or within the immediate street frontage.

7. The proposed plan provides adequate landscaping to maximize privacy and minimize the appearance of bulk.

Although these findings are only required for projects that would otherwise require a discretionary design review public hearing, all projects that result in or exacerbate floor area and/or building coverage of over 80 percent shall require the Community Development Department to give public notice of the application, pursuant to SMC 10.82.020(A) (Public Hearing). If such notice is required for a project that does not require a public hearing, the notice shall be mailed to notify neighbors that a zoning permit has been issued, including a description of the project, and shall include information regarding the appeal period for the zoning permit.

F. Conditions. The Planning Commission may impose conditions on design review permits, to meet the purposes of this title, the general plan and any applicable specific plan. Conditions may include but not be limited to maximum floor area, building coverage limit, maximum height, and minimum open space. In addition, the conditions specified in SMC 10.54.090 (Conditions of approval) and SMC 10.50.100 (Recommended conditions of approval) shall be imposed.

G. Resolution. Planning Commission decision shall be in the form of a written resolution and shall include all findings and conditions of approval.

H. Appeal. All decisions of the Planning Commission, with respect to design review permits, may be appealed to the City Council within 10 days of the Planning Commission decision. Appeals shall be filed and processed in accordance with Chapter 10.84 SMC (Appeals).

I. Effective Date. Design review permits shall become effective at the end of the appeal period, provided no appeal has been submitted.

J. Expiration of Permit. Design review permits shall expire two years following the effective date of the permit, provided no extension has been filed prior to the expiration date.

K. Extension. The applicant may request an extension of a design review permit prior to the expiration of the permit. The Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission (upon receipt of a referral from the Zoning Administrator) may grant one extension for up to one year, in accordance with SMC 10.50.140 (Extension of approved permits). [Ord. 1261 § 12, 2018; Ord. 1227 § 1, 2014; Ord. 1217 §§ 3 – 5, 2014; Ord. 1210 § 2, 2012; Ord. 1205 §§ 42, 43, 2012; Ord. 1204 § 1, 2011; Ord. 1200 §§ 4, 5, 2009; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

This submittal is applicable only to Planning Commission design review permits which result in a project site developed at less than the maximum density allowed on the respective site. For the purposes of this subsection, accessory dwelling units shall count towards fulfilling the density requirement.

The Community Development Director may waive specific submittal requirements where not applicable. [Ord. 1217 § 6, 2014; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.54.070 Additional submittals required.
Prior to making a final decision, the Community Development Department, Zoning Administrator, or Planning Commission may require the applicant to provide any other data deemed useful or necessary for permit approval. Such requirements may include, but not be limited to:

A. Models;

B. Photomontages;

C. Computer-generated imaging; and/or

D. Reports by expert consultants to address potential issues of concern, such as noise, odor, glare, sunlight, drainage, and traffic. [Ord. 1261 § 13, 2018; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.54.080 Referral.
Prior to making a final decision, the Community Development Department, Zoning Administrator, or Planning Commission may refer any design review application for reports and recommendations from the Fire Chief, City Engineer, Building Inspector, Health Officer or any other officer of the City or County regarding matters in their fields of competence or under their jurisdiction and which would be affected by the proposed development. [Ord. 1261 § 14, 2018; Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.54.090 Conditions of approval.
The following may be included as conditions of approval for design review:

A. Public Rights-of-Way.

1. Dedication. All required arterials and major collectors shall be dedicated to the full width required by the circulation element of the general plan. The dedication of minor collectors, local streets, pedestrian ways, and bicycle routes and paths adjoining any property line of the subject property may be required. Dedication shall extend to the street or pathway centerline bordering the property.

2. Improvements. For a project involving any increase in floor area, addition of bedroom or bathrooms, addition of dwelling units, substantial reconstruction of dwelling units, or partial reconstruction of dwelling units the value of which exceeds 10 percent of the valuation of the existing improvements, adjoining rights-of-way shall be improved to City standards, per the discretion of the City Engineer. Improvements may include but not be limited to curb, gutter, sidewalk, street and alley paving, street trees, street signs, shoulder parking improvements, streetlights, and all required utilities. Existing improvements which are damaged and/or hazardous to the public safety must also be corrected.

B. Landscape and Mitigation Bond Requirements.

1. Landscape Performance and Maintenance Bond. Within the waterfront area east of Bridgeway bounded by El Portal on the south and the north City limits, a maintenance bond shall be required to insure that landscaped areas are maintained for a period of two years from the date of final approval for occupancy. Other projects which require installation of landscaping may, at the discretion of the Planning Commission and/or Community Development Director, be required to submit to the City a refundable performance bond or an equivalent security to guarantee the installation and survival of required landscaping for a period of two years, prior to the issuance of a building permit. This bond may also be used to ensure the success and stability of mitigation measures required pursuant to a California Environmental Quality Act initial study/mitigated negative declaration or environmental impact report, if applicable. The bond or security to be used is as follows:

a. The performance security may be provided, at the discretion of the City, by cash, by placing the assessed dollar amount in a certificate of deposit made payable to the City of Sausalito, or by securing a performance bond.

b. The dollar amount of the performance security will be based on an estimate from a nursery which includes plant material, irrigation equipment, and labor costs, or for mitigation measures, in a manner to be determined by the Community Development Director based on the characteristics of the required mitigation measure. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.54.100 Time limits for construction.
A. Purposes. The purpose of this section is to regulate the duration of construction projects in order to avoid negative impacts on the City resulting from lengthy construction activities. Such negative impacts include detrimental effects of lengthy construction on residential neighborhoods, such as construction noise and increased traffic, reduction in available parking, and the presence of portable toilets. In addition to the general purposes of this section, the City has adopted this section because:

1. A continuous stream of large numbers of construction projects on private properties within the City for many years past has resulted in substantial and continuing adverse impacts on the City and its residents from construction activities;

2. Among those adverse impacts are long-term noise disturbances to neighbors of the construction projects, loss of already inadequate on-street parking due to the presence of large numbers of construction vehicles, and frequent closures of the City’s narrow streets for construction deliveries and staging, which closures hinder and/or eliminate local and emergency access for varying periods of time;

3. Numerous private individual large-scale projects have been designed and built in the City involving construction for many years, thus prolonging the adverse construction impacts created by those projects;

4. It is in the interests of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Sausalito to place a reasonable time limit on the duration of each construction project, so as to balance the needs of the project site property owner with those of nearby residents and the community generally in the safe and peaceful enjoyment of their properties;

5. The time limits adopted in this section allow an adequate and reasonable amount of time for the kinds of construction projects undertaken in the City; and

6. Substantial penalties should be imposed upon persons who violate the time limits imposed pursuant to this section, so as to encourage compliance with such time limits and achieve the purposes of this section.

B. Construction Time Limit Required. As part of any application for a construction permit for a project which obtained a design review permit, obtained an amendment of an existing design review permit, or should have obtained a design review permit (including, without limitation, any such application with respect to improvements that have been constructed without or in violation of an existing valid design review permit, or administrative design review permits for the purposes of this section), the applicant shall file a reasonable estimate of the value of the project, and based thereon, a construction time limit shall be established for the project in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection C of this section. The applicant shall submit information reasonably requested by the Community Development Director to support the estimated value of the project such documentation may include without limitation an executed construction contract. Compliance with such time limit shall become a condition of the design review permit. The time for completion of the construction shall also be indicated on the construction permit. For projects exceeding $500,000 in project valuation, a detailed GANTT chart (or other graphic display acceptable to the Community Development Director) depicting the sequence of steps necessary for completion of the project, including detailed information on the critical path of the project, duration of critical tasks, and predicted inspection dates, shall be submitted prior to the issuance of any construction permit. Once approved, the property owner shall provide the City with written quarterly job progress reports consistent with the approved chart.

C. Construction Time Limit. Except where a longer time period is approved pursuant to subsection D of this section, the maximum time for completion of approved alterations, additions, modifications, repairs, or new construction, following issuance of the construction permit, shall not exceed the following limits. These limits are not altered or extended by work delays or stoppages due to the enforcement actions resulting from violation(s) of the municipal code.

Estimated Value of Project

Construction Time Limit*

$0 to $500,000

18 months

$500,001 to $1,000,000

24 months

Greater than $1,000,000

30 months

*    For landscaping work (including retaining walls and grading) approved as part of the construction project, the applicant shall have an additional 90 days to complete the landscaping work after final building inspection approval or issuance of an occupancy permit (whichever occurs later) for the main construction project. This additional 90 days shall not apply to construction projects solely comprised of landscaping.

D. Construction Time Limit Extension.

1.a. Construction Activities. Prior to or following the commencement of construction an applicant may apply for one or more extension(s) of the established construction time limit; provided, however, in no event shall any single extension granted exceed 180 days, nor shall the total extension(s) granted exceed the following:

Estimated Value of Project

Construction Time Limit Extension

$0 to $500,000

270 days

$500,001 to $1,000,000

360 days

Greater than $1,000,000

360 days

b. Landscaping Activities. For landscaping work (including retaining walls and grading) approved as part of the construction project, the applicant may apply for an extension not to exceed 30 days beyond the 90-day landscaping time limit specified in subsection C of this section. Such application shall be filed prior to the expiration of the 90-day time limit and shall be considered by the Community Development Director, who shall have the authority to grant said extension only if, in his or her opinion, such extension beyond the 90-day landscaping time limit is warranted because of delays caused by inclement weather or circumstances beyond the property owner’s control.

2. Application Contents. An application for an extension of the construction time limit shall be accompanied by complete working drawings for the construction, a written explanation of the reasons for the requested extension, and a fee as established by resolution of the City Council.

3. Public Hearing and Notice. Within 15 working days of receipt of a complete application for an extension in accordance with subsection (D)(1)(a) of this section, the Zoning Administrator shall hold a public hearing on the said application. The Zoning Administrator may obtain input from the Building Inspector and the City Engineer.

4. Findings. The Zoning Administrator may grant an extension if the following findings can be made:

a. Such extension will not have a material deleterious effect on the neighborhood in which the project is located; and

b. Any one or more of the following factors is present and presents an unusual and substantial obstacle to complying with the standard construction time limit:

i. Site topography;

ii. Site access;

iii. Geologic issues;

iv. Neighborhood considerations;

v. Weather-related grading restrictions; or

vi. Other unusual factors (except lack of financing).

5. Conditions of Approval. The Zoning Administrator may apply reasonable conditions of approval deemed necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section.

6. Notice of Decision. The decision of the Zoning Administrator shall be in the form of a written resolution and shall include the findings upon which the decision is based, applicable conditions of approval, and a summary of the appeal process. A written decision shall be mailed to the applicant and all parties who participated in the process via oral or written comments.

7. Appeals. The decision of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 10.84 SMC.

E. Penalties.

1. If a property owner fails to complete construction by the applicable time limit established in this section, the property owner shall be subject to the following penalties payable to the City:

Period of Time That Project Remains Incomplete Beyond Applicable Time Limit

Penalty

First 60 days

$400.00 per day (i.e., $24,000 maximum penalty applicable to this 60-day period)

61st through 120th day

$600.00 per day (i.e., $36,000 maximum penalty applicable to this 60-day period)

121st day and every day thereafter

$800.00 per day (to a maximum of the lesser of 20% of project value or $200,000)

2. Penalties, fees and costs due to the City pursuant to this subsection E are due each day as the penalties accrue.

F. Deposits.

1. Upon reaching the time limits set out in subsections C and D of this section, if construction has not been completed, or if no final inspection has been made or a certificate of occupancy issued, the property owner or his representative shall deliver to the Community Development Department a refundable deposit (in cash or other security instrument acceptable to the City and valid for a minimum time period of two years) in the amount of $24,000, plus a nonrefundable administrative fee as established by resolution of the City Council.

2. If no deposit is made as provided in subsection (F)(1) of this section, the Building Official shall issue a stop work order.

3. On or before the sixtieth day that the project has remained incomplete, and no final inspection has been made and no certificate of occupancy issued, the property owner or his representative shall deliver to the Community Development Department an additional refundable deposit (in cash or other security instrument acceptable to the City and valid for a minimum time period of two years) in the amount of $36,000, plus a nonrefundable administrative fee as established by resolution of the City Council.

4. If no deposit is made as provided in subsection (F)(3) of this section, the Building Official shall issue a stop work order.

5. On or before the one-hundred-twentieth day that the project has remained incomplete, and no final inspection has been made and no certificate of occupancy issued, the property owner or his representative shall deliver to the Community Development Department an additional refundable deposit (in cash or other security instrument acceptable to the City and valid for a minimum time period of two years) in the amount of $140,000, plus a nonrefundable administrative fee as established by resolution of the City Council.

6. If no deposit is made as provided in subsection (F)(5) of this section, the Building Official shall issue a stop work order.

7. If the property owner fails to complete construction by the applicable time limit, the applicable penalties shall accrue daily up to the maximum set out in subsection E of this section.

8. If the property owner believes that the failure to meet the applicable time limit was caused by circumstances beyond the property owner’s control, the property owner may file a written statement to that effect with the Community Development Director at the time of making the deposit as described in subsections (F)(1), (3) and/or (5) of this section and provide any documentation substantiating such grounds of appeal and the effect on the construction. If the property owner makes such filing, no part of the deposit cash or other security instrument shall be forfeited to the City if construction is completed within 30 days of the deposit. If construction is completed after the 30 days and the Community Development Director concurs with the property owner’s statement as to the cause of the failure to meet the deadline, the Community Development Director shall waive the penalty and return the cash deposit or other security instrument to the property owner. If the Community Development Director does not concur with the property owner’s statement, such statement shall be treated as an appeal under subsection G of this section and all the provisions of that subsection shall apply. As used in this section, the term “circumstances beyond the property owner’s control” shall mean events outside the property owner’s reasonable control that are not caused by the property owner’s willful or unlawful misconduct or gross negligence (or that of the property owner’s contractor or subcontractors), such as acts of God, earthquake, labor disputes that are not caused, directly or indirectly, by the property owner or the property owner’s contractor or subcontractors, shortages of supplies, riots, war, acts of terrorism, fire, epidemics, or delays of common carriers. A failure of a lender to make or fund a loan commitment shall not be deemed to be “circumstances beyond the property owner’s control.”

9.

G. Appeals.

1. A penalty imposed pursuant to subsections B through F of this section may be appealed to the Planning Commission on the grounds that the property owner was unable to comply with the applicable time limit as a result of circumstances beyond the property owner’s control.

2. Any penalty due under subsection E of this section in excess of the deposit made under subsection F of this section shall be a personal debt owed to the City by the property owner(s) and, in addition to all other means of enforcement and collection, shall become a lien against the property and shall be subject to the same penalties (including interest thereon at the maximum rate allowed by law from the date the lien attaches until the date of payment) and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes.

I. Violations.

10.62.010 Purpose.
This chapter establishes a framework for nonconforming uses and structures and a procedure for nonconformity permits to allow additions or alterations to, and replacement of, existing or previously existing nonconforming uses and structures. In addition to the general purposes of this title, the specific purposes of this chapter are as follows:

A. To acknowledge the existence of legally established structures and/or uses that may become nonconforming due to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title;

B. To allow the continued use of legally established nonconforming uses as long as the use remains operational and the structure remains;

C. To provide a permit process to allow for additions or alterations to, and/or replacement of, existing or previously existing nonconforming structures;

D. To provide a permit process for substituting one nonconforming use with another nonconforming use of similar or less intensive character; and

E. To provide for replacement of a nonconforming use or structure that was involuntarily vacated and/or demolished. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.62.020 Applicability.
Any use or structure legally existing at the time of adoption of this title or any of its amendments and not in compliance with the ordinance shall be allowed to continue and shall be considered a nonconforming use or structure, unless otherwise specified in this chapter. This chapter does not apply to any use or structure established in violation of any pre-existing zoning ordinance inside or outside the City of Sausalito, unless the use or structure now complies with this title. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.62.030 Conditional uses.
Any use other than transmission poles and lines existing on the effective date of this title which is listed as a conditional use in the applicable district shall be and remain a nonconforming use until a conditional use permit is obtained pursuant to this title. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.62.040 Nonconforming uses.
A. Existing structures or premises that are utilized for a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, substituted or structurally altered unless one of the following conditions is met:

1. The structure or use is changed to a permitted use; or

2. A nonconformity permit is secured, pursuant to SMC 10.62.070 (Nonconformity permits).

B. A nonconforming use located within any zoning district, which was involuntarily ceased, may be reinstated within one year of the cessation of the use.

C. A nonconforming use that is changed to a conforming use shall not return to a nonconforming use.

D. A nonconforming use that is located in a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places may be allowed to resume if the use was involuntarily ceased and necessary permits are secured.

E. Nonconforming use of a structure or premises shall not be allowed under the following conditions:

1. Nonconforming use has been voluntarily vacated for six months or more; or

2. Nonconforming use has ceased for six months or more due to voluntary demolition of the structure or premises; or

3. Nonconforming use that involves only minor structures (e.g., fences, signs, and buildings of less than 400 square feet floor area) has ceased for 90 days or more.

F. For purposes of this title, a use shall be deemed to have ceased when it has been discontinued either temporarily or permanently, whether with the intent to abandon the use or not. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.62.050 Nonconforming structures.
A. Substitution, Replacement, Extension. Nonconforming structures may be replicated, replaced, renovated, or expanded consistent with nonconforming zoning entitlement according to only the following specific circumstances:

1. Structural additions and remodels to nonconforming structures that do not increase or exacerbate the specific nonconformity. An addition or remodel which shifts a specific nonconformity from one part of a parcel or building to another part is not considered to exacerbate that nonconformity if a nonconformity permit has been obtained based on the following findings:

a. The shift of nonconformity improves the appearance of the structure;

b. The shift of nonconformity provides a public benefit;

c. The shift of nonconformity brings the structure into closer conformity with applicable zoning regulations and the general plan; and

d. The shift of nonconformity does not intensify the use of the property.

2. A nonconforming structure, or portion thereof, that is voluntarily demolished may be replicated, subject to a nonconformity permit.

3. A nonconforming structure, or portion thereof, that is involuntarily demolished (partially or substantially) may be replicated if building permits are issued within one year of involuntary demolition.

4. A nonconforming structure that is involuntarily and substantially demolished may be remodeled, subject to a nonconformity permit and design review approval.

5. Any nonconforming structure that is voluntarily and substantially demolished may be remodeled, subject to a nonconforming permit and design review approval.

6. Any nonconforming structure that is either voluntarily or involuntarily partially demolished may be remodeled as long as the new building elements comply with code and the nonconforming portion of the building is not demolished.

7. A nonconforming structure that is voluntarily demolished cannot be substantially remodeled, unless it is brought into full code compliance or a variance is obtained.

8. A nonconforming structure which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and which is involuntarily demolished may be substantially replicated subject to Historic Preservation Commission review.

B. Permit and Parking Requirements. The table that follows (Table 10.62-1, Parking and Permit Requirements for Nonconforming Structures) summarizes the parking requirements based on the type of demolition (voluntary versus involuntary), amount of demolition (substantial versus partial), and permit required, as outlined in subsection A of this section (Substitution, Replacement and Extension).

[Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.62.060 Documentation of existing or pre-existing nonconformity.
Existing nonconforming structures may be replicated without a loss of the nonconforming feature(s) subject to the following:

A. Documentation. Documentation of the specific existing or pre-existing structural nonconformity is presented either:

1. By presentation of architectural or building permit plans authorized by the City or by demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Community Development Director that the nonconformity was constructed legally without a permit before building permits were required; or

2. If a nonconformity permit is required for the project, through evidence presented at the required public hearing before the Planning Commission, which documents the legal status and, if no longer existing, prior existence and extent of the lost nonconformity.

B. Title XXIV. All replacement structures shall be constructed to meet the current Title XXIV requirements. Replication of structures that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or on the California Register of Historic Places, or are designated local landmarks or determined to be potential historic resources, shall be constructed to meet the current California Historic Building Code.

C. Requirements. All replacement structures shall be subject to the requirements of SMC 10.62.050(A) (Substitution, Replacement, Extension) and 10.62.050(B) (Permit and Parking Requirements). [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.62.070 Nonconformity permits.
A. Applicability. Nonconformity permits shall be required to maintain nonconforming zoning entitlements for the following:

1. Substitution of a nonconforming use with another nonconforming use of a similar or less intensive character.

2. Extension of a nonconforming use to those parts of a building that were specifically designed or arranged for such use prior to the date when such use of a building became nonconforming.

3. Enlargement, modification, or structural alteration of a structure or premises occupied by a nonconforming use.

4. Reinstatement of a nonconforming use located within any zoning district if the nonconforming use was ceased involuntarily for more than one year.

5. The remodel of a nonconforming structure per subsections (A)(1), (A)(2) and (A)(4) of this section and the project involves a physical change to the part of the structure which is nonconforming.

Submittal shall include a site plan drawn to scale showing locations of all existing and proposed buildings, yards, driveways, and parking areas; floor plans showing the location of uses in the structure; and the required fee. Application procedures and processing timeframes shall be consistent with Chapter 10.50 SMC (Land Use Permit Procedures), State law, and procedural guidelines established by the Community Development Director. Acceptance of an application does not constitute any indication of approval.

D. Environmental Review. Applications for nonconformity permits shall be subject to environmental review pursuant to SMC 10.50.080 (Environmental Review) and SMC Title 11 (Environmental Protection).

E. Public Notice and Hearing.

1. Plans that document the nonconforming zoning entitlement being requested are on file with the City or an evidentiary public hearing has been held to document the existence and extent of requested nonconforming zoning entitlement.

2. The existing nonconforming use and/or structure has not resulted in a notable negative impact or nuisance to the surrounding properties and district (i.e., excessive parking demand, traffic, noise, view obstruction, etc.).

3. The nonconforming use or structure is not incompatible with the general character of the surrounding neighborhood or district.

4. If the application is for a nonconforming use, the nonconforming use will contribute to the social and economic vitality of the district or will otherwise benefit the public health, safety and welfare.

5. The requested action will not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning district.

6. If it is a nonconforming structure, the applicant has reduced the nonconformities to an extent reasonably practicable.

7. For nonconformity permits that trigger conformance with current parking requirements pursuant to Table 10.62-1, the Planning Commission may waive the current parking requirement and allow the maintenance of the existing nonconforming parking entitlements through the grant of the nonconformity permit, if the Commission finds that (a) it is not practicable to provide parking on site in a manner that preserves neighborhood character, and (b) for substantial replications, the provision of the required parking would be in conflict with the replication of the structure, and (c) preserving the nonconforming parking entitlements is the best solution to be consistent with the goals, policies and intent of the general plan.

H. Notice of Decision. The Planning Commission’s decision shall be in the form of a written resolution, which shall include findings on which the decision was based, applicable conditions of approval and a summary of the appeal process. Written decision shall be mailed to the applicant.

No action, inaction or recommendation regarding any development by the Planning Commission shall be held void or invalid or be set aside by any court by reason of error or omission pertaining to the notices, including the failure to give any notice required by this section. Any determination of error or omission shall require court examination of the entire case, and that such error or omission causes a different result than would have been probable if such error or omission had not occurred or existed. There shall be no presumption that the error or omission is prejudicial or that injury was done if error or omission is shown. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.66.090 Appeals.
All decisions of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council within 10 days of the decision date. All appeals shall be in writing and shall be submitted and processed in accordance with Chapter 10.84 SMC (Appeals). [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.66.120 Amendments.
The Community Development Director may approve changes to a diagrammatic floor plan approved in conjunction with a condominium conversion permit subject to the following requirements:

B. The proposed changes must be consistent with all applicable provisions of this title.

C. The application shall include a demonstration to the satisfaction of the Community Development Director that the condominium homeowners’ association, as well as the record owner and all record holders of security interests in the condominium unit, have reviewed and consented to the proposed changes.

D. Within 30 days of recordation as provided by California Civil Code Section 1351, a copy of the condominium plan or amendment to the condominium plan shall be filed with the City. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.66.130 Tenant provisions.
In addition to the other provisions of this chapter and SMC Title 9 (Subdivisions), the subdivider/applicant shall comply with all the current provisions of Government Code Section 66427 (or any law that supersedes that section), including but not limited to those regulations related to noticing existing tenants of residential units proposed for condominium conversion, tenants’ rights, increase in rents, moving expenses, senior citizens and low-moderate income tenants. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.66.140 Effect on City’s low and moderate income housing supply.
In order to reduce the effect of condominium conversions on the City’s housing supply and to minimize the displacement of tenants, the number of condominium conversions shall be limited to no more than five percent of the City’s potentially convertible rental stock in any one calendar year. Conversion applications will be processed in the order that completed applications are submitted. A proposed project that is larger than the permitted number of units in a given year, if approved, will be considered to have used the permitted number for as many future years as necessary.

The potentially convertible rental stock will be defined as follows: the number of rental units in buildings of two or more units, as determined by the most recent census, plus any new rental units constructed since the census, minus any units which have received tentative map approval to convert since the census. Once the yearly limit has been reached, a project may be approved for conversion only if the Planning Commission makes one or more of the following findings:

A. The developer will provide for a significant increase in housing for low and moderate income households or senior citizen households over and above the provisions of this chapter.

B. The developer will provide for the construction of new rental housing.

C. The developer will donate an acceptable site or an acceptable amount of funds to the City for construction of new rental or senior citizen housing.

The need and demand for low cost home ownership to be provided for by this project will outweigh the detriment caused by further reduction of the rental stock. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

To provide relief from the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance when special circumstances apply to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, and the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning district; and

B. To ensure conditions are applied so that the adjustment authorized does not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which such property is situated. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.020 Authority and applicability.
The Zoning Administrator may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a variance application for projects for which the Zoning Administrator is the granting authority, as specified by SMC 10.80.040 (Zoning Administrator), unless otherwise restricted by State law. The Planning Commission may approve, conditionally approve or deny a variance application for all other projects. Project must comply with all other provisions of this title.

A variance shall not be used to:

A. Reduce the minimum lot area required for a new land division by Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 SMC (Zoning Districts Regulations) such that the project would increase densities above those specified by the general plan; or

B. Waive any other requirement of this title or SMC Title 9 (Subdivisions) related to general plan consistency and other subdivision map requirements; or

C. Authorize land uses other than those identified as allowed in the particular zoning district by Chapters 10.20 through 10.28 SMC (Zoning Districts Regulations), as required by California Government Code Section 65906. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.030 Application contents and submittal.
Applications for variances shall include all information specified by resolution of the Planning Commission. Submittal shall include a site plan drawn to scale showing location of all existing and proposed buildings, yards, driveways, and parking areas; an explanation of how the findings specified by SMC 10.68.050 (Findings) may be made; and the required fee. Application procedures and processing timeframes shall be consistent with Chapter 10.50 SMC (Land Use Permit Procedures), this chapter, State law and additional procedural guidelines established by the Community Development Director. Acceptance of an application does not constitute any indication of approval. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.040 Public notice and hearing.
The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on an application for a variance, as applicable, following completion of a staff report pursuant to SMC 10.50.090 (Staff reports and recommendations). The public hearing shall be noticed and held in accordance with Chapter 10.82 SMC (Public Notice and Hearings). [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.050 Findings.
The granting authority (Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission, as applicable) may approve or conditionally approve a variance only if the following findings can be made, as established by California Government Code Section 65906:

A. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property involved or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other property or uses in the same district.

B. Owing to such exceptional or extraordinary circumstances the literal enforcement of the provisions of the title would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship.

C. Such variance is necessary for the preservation of a substantial property right of the petitioner, possessed by other property in the same district.

D. The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvement in the vicinity or in the district in which the subject property is located.

E. The granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties classified in the same zoning district.

F. The granting of such variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title and the general plan. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.060 Conditions of approval.
The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may apply reasonable conditions of approval deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare and secure the objectives of this title and the general plan. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.070 Notice of decision.
The Zoning Administrator’s or Planning Commission’s decision shall be in the form of a written resolution, which shall include findings on which the decision was based, applicable conditions of approval and a summary of the appeal process. Written decision shall be mailed to the applicant. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.090 Effective date.
Variances shall become effective for the purposes of construction permit issuance 10 days after the decision is rendered. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

10.68.100 Expiration.
Variances are valid for one year unless a different expiration date is stipulated at the time of approval, a building permit has been issued and construction diligently pursued, or the permit is renewed and extended. If more than one phase of a development is approved in a single action and later phases remain outstanding, approval shall lapse at the end of the authorized timeframe. [Ord. 1167 § 2, 2003.]

11.08.010 Findings and determination.
The City Council finds and determines:

A. The County of Marin has adopted a comprehensive general plan which is a highly sophisticated approach to resolution of the extraordinary complexities of suburban growth. The City has also adopted a comprehensive general plan designed to provide for orderly growth within its boundaries. Coordinated and cooperative efforts by the County and its cities are required in order to implement the growth objectives of their respective general plans.

B. Unregulated, capricious development has in the past caused, and unless controlled in the future will cause, severe and irremediable injury to the City, to Marin County and their environment in that:

1. It has resulted in a severe shortage of housing for citizens of low and moderate income and sorely limited the economic heterogeneity of the population;

2. It has wastefully compelled construction of public facilities on a crisis basis;

3. It has sorely overtaxed municipal service districts resulting in numerous water and sewerage moratoriums;

4. It has occasioned costs to the taxpayers far in excess of tax gains;

5. It has engendered public skepticism concerning the ability of local governments to protect Marin’s environment adequately.

C. Standard zoning regulations alone cannot provide the delicate types of development review procedures which will ensure a high level of environmental protection, construction of low and moderate cost housing, sequential orderly development and other goals set forth in the Sausalito General Plan and Countywide general plan.

D. There exist within Marin logical and readily identifiable planning areas, which include both incorporated and unincorporated areas, but which must be precisely regulated by joint action of the County and the affected cities to ensure coordinated compliance with their respective general plans.

E. At the present time in Marin, there are numerous inadequate water and sewerage systems, serious overcrowding on public transit facilities, extensive highway congestion, severe flooding and seismic hazards of indeterminate scope, all of which sorely limit the ability of the County and cities to accommodate unpaced burgeoning growth.

F. The County, numerous cities, and special districts are diligently endeavoring to alleviate the serious problems set forth in subsection (B)(3) of this section, and will be able to resolve them only, when essential, if growth can be properly and effectively staged in a manner which will not overextend existing community facilities and allow some respite to bring deficient services up to necessary standards.

G. It would be highly detrimental to the welfare of Marin County and its environs to exclude, intentionally or inadvertently, minority, poor or aged citizens from the general populace of Marin County. The only effective means to prevent such exclusion is the provision of ample low and moderate income housing. Significant Federal subsidies are presently unavailable and traditional zoning has been ineffective in this regard. Although Marin is actively engaged in numerous efforts to encourage and compel construction of low and moderate cost housing, only through development review, one of the principal purposes of which is achievement of this objective, is there any likelihood of securing such housing.

H. The public welfare requires the establishment of Residential Development Review Boards to accomplish the following:

1. Provide significant incentives which will encourage developers to include low and moderate income housing in their undertakings;

2. Prevent premature development in the absence of necessary utilities and municipal services;

3. Ensure that development will not exceed the environmental holding capacity of the specific land and the County generally;

4. Coordinate City and County planning and land regulation in a manner consistent with the Countywide plan and local City general plans;

5. Facilitate and implement the realization of general plan goals which cannot be accomplished by zoning alone, principally in connection with low and moderate cost housing;

6. Direct growth in a manner which will ensure a proper relationship to community needs and capabilities;

7. Encourage and facilitate development proposals which accomplish the objectives of the Countywide general plan and the respective City general plans. [Ord. 897 § 1, 1976.]

11.08.020 Development review area established.
Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 22.96 of the Marin County Code, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has, by resolution, declared its intention to establish a residential development review area encompassing a portion of southern Marin County, consisting of the cities of Belvedere, Mill Valley, Sausalito and Tiburon, and environs, and the unincorporated communities of Marin City, Strawberry and Homestead Valley. The Sausalito Planning Commission has conducted public hearings on such proposal and has recommended to the Sausalito City Council that the City of Sausalito cooperate in the creation of such residential development review area by the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

Pursuant to such action of the Marin County Board of Supervisors and the recommendation of the Sausalito Planning Commission, the entire incorporated area of the City is hereby designated as a residential development review area which shall be subject to the restrictions of this chapter, contingent upon like action by the Marin County Board of Supervisors and the City Council of each of the cities mentioned above.

11.08.050 Residential Development Review Board – Staff.
The planning staffs of the County and cities shall serve as the staff of the Board and shall provide necessary services in accordance with the joint powers agreement between the parties. In the discharge of its duties under this chapter, the staff shall consult with all involved utility districts on a regular basis. [Ord. 897 § 7, 1976.]

11.08.060 Residential Development Review Board – Approval of building permits for residential construction.
Except for a single-family residence on a lot legally in existence before the effective date of the reestablishment of a residential development review area, or for projects of up to 10 units as specified in the joint powers agreement which are within infilling areas designated in the agreement by the County in unincorporated areas, or by the City of jurisdiction in incorporated areas and which are consistent with adopted local plans and the zoning ordinances, no building permit shall be issued after the effective date of the joint powers agreement referred to in this section for any residential construction, including mobile homes, within such area, unless the construction has been approved by the Residential Development Review Board. [Ord. 897 § 3, 1976.]

11.08.070 Development proposal – Consideration by Board.

These criteria shall be calculated strictly in accordance with the amplification of criteria contained in the joint powers agreement.

If the project involves the division of land only, it shall be rated solely in accordance with criteria for environmental impacts and utilities and public services. For the purposes of comparing such projects with actual development proposals, the raw score shall be multiplied by a factor which would make possible a total score of 100 for the final rating. [Ord. 897 § 10, 1976.]

11.08.110 Development proposal – Basis for determination.
When all rating hearings are completed, the Review Board shall determine, solely on the basis of numerical ratings and the number of units to be allowed in accordance with SMC 11.08.130, which projects are eligible for approval. [Ord. 897 § 11, 1976.]

11.08.120 Construction time limit following approval.
Except in cases involving phased development or bare land, construction of each structure must actually commence within two years following issuance of an approval by the Review Board, otherwise the approval shall be null and void. [Ord. 897 § 12, 1976.]

11.08.130 Approval quota determination and allocation of units.
A. Each year, the Board of Supervisors and City Councils (or their delegate members, subject to ratification by each body) shall meet in joint session on a date specified in accordance with procedures contained in the joint powers agreement to determine the number of residential units which can be approved during the subsequent year.

B. These determinations shall be based upon:

1. The Countywide and applicable local general plans;

2. The number of units approved and constructed in prior years;

3. Availability of utilities and public services;

4. The goals, purposes and objectives contained in SMC 11.08.100;

5. The current availability of low and moderate cost housing.

C. Representatives of all utility districts and companies located within the review area shall be invited to the meeting and may participate in the deliberations in all respects except voting.

D. The allocation of units for each four-month period shall be specified at the time the annual number is set. If the number of approved units falls below the four-month allocation for one session, the difference shall be carried over to the next four-month allocation, until the final session of the year. [Ord. 897 § 13, 1976.]

11.08.140 Staged projects.
If a developer so requests, the project may be considered in segments. If the segments are interdependent, the Review Board may approve the entire plan subject to the requirement that a limited number of units will be constructed each year. Amendments to staged projects shall be processed as new applications; provided, that if an amendment is not approved by the Review Board, the originally approved plan shall remain valid, unless local time limits are exceeded. [Ord. 897 § 14, 1976.]

11.08.150 Project approval mandatory when under unit quota.
If the number of units in projects pending for action by the Board is less than the number of units to be allowed pursuant to SMC 11.08.130, the Board shall issue approvals for all of such units. [Ord. 897 § 15, 1976.]

11.08.160 Judicial review of board decision or procedure.

Prior ordinance history: Ords. 812 and 912.

11.12.010 Purpose and intent.
The general plan of the City recognizes the contribution of both trees and views to the character and beauty of the City. The removal of trees without reasonable care would destroy the natural beauty of certain areas, contribute to erosion, increase the costs of drainage systems, reduce protection against wind, and impair residential privacy and quiet. This chapter acknowledges that trees and views, and the benefits derived from each, may come into conflict. This chapter presents guidelines to resolve such conflicts so as to provide a reasonable balance between tree- and view-related values. It is the intent of this chapter to provide an atmosphere in which residents of this community can resolve their differences amongst themselves without City intervention. For these reasons, the City Council enacts these regulations to promote the public health, safety and welfare. All tree work to be performed shall be in accordance to pruning standards of the International Society of Arboriculture Western Chapter. (ISA copies available at Community Development Department.)

In reviewing applications and claims pursuant to this chapter, the duties of the Planning Commission will be:

A. To consider removal/alteration permits and view claim arbitrations pursuant to this chapter;

B. To serve as an administration decision-maker in adjudicating disputes arising between claimants and tree owners, to make findings on such disputes, to determine an appropriate resolution to such disputes and to require corrective actions in conformity with its findings and determinations pursuant to this chapter;

C. To recommend programs, policies and ordinances to implement and support the City’s goals as set out herein; and

D. To encourage and promote the planting and proper husbandry of trees throughout the City and to discourage the maintenance of trees that unduly diminish desirable views as well as the planting and maintenance of certain species. [Ord. 1246 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1107 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1050 § 1, 1989.]

A. Permit Procedures for Removal or Alteration of Protected Trees. It is unlawful for any person to remove or alter any protected tree, as defined herein, without a permit issued and posted as provided in this chapter except for the purpose of routine pruning. No protected tree may be removed or altered on any undeveloped property on Saturday, Sunday or holidays or at any time except during regular working hours (8:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m.), Monday through Friday.

1. Applicant’s Responsibility.

a. Application. A tree removal/alteration permit shall be obtained from the Community Development Department in any situation which involves the removal or alteration or possible damage to a protected tree or trees, including issuance of a permit for building, grading or demolition. The permit application must be accompanied by an arborist report stating the need for tree removal or alteration based on the criteria set forth in subsection B of this section, and recommending protective measures for any endangered tree. If the applicant is not the owner of the property on which the tree or trees are located, the applicant shall attach the written permission of the property owner.

b. Posting of Application and Tree Tags. After submission of an application under this section, the applicant shall be issued tree tags, one of which is to be posted on each tree proposed for removal or alteration. Within two working days after making an application for a tree removal or alteration permit, the applicant shall place the tags on the trees and post the application so that it is clearly visible from the street at the front of the lot. The tags and notice shall not be removed for 10 working days thereafter.

c. Posting of Permit. Following issuance of a tree removal permit, an applicant shall post a copy in plain view on the site while tree removal or alteration work is underway.

d. Filing Fee. The applicant shall pay the filing fee established by the City Council for a tree removal or alteration permit.

2. City’s Responsibility. The Community Development Department shall be responsible for receiving applications for protected tree removal and/or alteration permits, for confirming that the required information has been provided by the applicant, and for issuing tree tags and notices to the applicant. The Community Development Department shall route all tree removal/alteration applications and arborist’s reports to:

a. The Planning Commission if the protected tree or trees are on private, developed property;

b. The City Engineer if the tree(s) are on public property.

Site inspection shall be made by the responsible reviewing agency and written comments received regarding the application shall be considered. The responsible reviewing agency may require submission by the applicant of a site plan and/or survey or such other information as is deemed necessary by the responsible reviewing agency.

B. Criteria for Grant or Denial of Application for Removal or Alteration of Protected Trees.

1. In order to grant a tree removal or alteration permit, it must be determined that removal or alteration is necessary in order to accomplish any one of the following objectives:

a. To ensure the public safety as it relates to the health of the tree, potential hazard to life or property, proximity to existing or proposed structures, and interference with utilities or sewers;

b. To allow reasonable enjoyment of the property, including sunlight, and the right to develop the property;

c. To take reasonable advantage of views;

d. To pursue good, professional practices of forestry or landscape design.

2. In order to grant a tree removal permit, it must be determined that any one of the following conditions is satisfied:

a. The tree to be removed will be replaced by a desirable tree.

b. The Planning Commission waives the requirement in subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section based on information provided by the applicant/owner.

3. A finding of any one of the following is grounds for denial, regardless of the finding in subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section:

a. Removal of a healthy tree of a desired species can be avoided by:

i. Reasonable redesign of the site plan, prior to construction;

ii. Thinning to reduce density, e.g., open windows;

iii. Shaping to reduce height or spread, using thinning cuts only (drop crotch);

iv. Heading or topping – this is the least preferable method, due to the tree’s health and appearance and cost of maintenance.

b. Adequate provisions for drainage, erosion control, land stability, windscreen, visual screening, privacy and for restoration of ground cover and/or other foliage damaged by the tree work have not been made in situations where such problems are anticipated as a result of the removal or alteration.

c. The tree to be removed is a member of a group of trees in which each tree is dependent upon the others for survival.

d. The value of the tree to the neighborhood is greater than its inconvenience to the owner. The effects on visual, auditory, and wind screening, privacy and neighboring vegetation must be considered.

e. The need for protection of privacy for the property on which the tree is located and/or for adjacent properties.

C. Conditions of Approval for Protecting Trees During Construction. Adequate protection shall be provided during the construction period for any protected trees which are to remain standing. Measures deemed necessary by the reviewing agency in consideration of the size, species, condition and location of the protected trees to remain may include any of the following:

1. Before the start of any clearing, excavation, construction or other work on the site, every protected tree deemed to be endangered by the work shall be securely fenced off at the “protected perimeter,” which shall be either the outer limits of the branches of such protected tree (the drip line) or such greater limits as may be established by the reviewing agency. Such fences shall remain in place for the duration of all such work. All protected trees to be removed shall be clearly marked. A plan shall be established for the removal and disposal of logs, brush, earth and other debris which will avoid injury to any protected tree.

2. Where proposed development or other site work is to encroach upon the protected perimeter of any protected tree, special measures shall be incorporated to allow the roots to breathe and obtain water and nutrients. Any excavation, cutting, filling, or compaction of the existing ground surface within the protected perimeter shall be minimized. No asphalt or other paving materials shall be added. No change in existing ground levels shall occur within four feet of the base of any protected tree at any time. No burning or use of equipment with an open flame shall occur near or within the protected perimeter.

3. No storage or dumping of oil, gas, chemicals or other substances that may be harmful to trees shall occur within the protected perimeter of any protected trees, or any other location on the site from which such substances might enter the protected perimeter. No heavy construction equipment or construction materials shall be operated or stored within the protected perimeter. Wires shall not be attached to any protected tree, except as needed for support of the tree. No sign, other than a tag showing the botanical classification, shall be attached to any protected tree.

4. Periodically during construction, the leaves of the protected trees shall be thoroughly sprayed with water to prevent buildup of dust and other pollution that would inhibit transpiration.

5. If any damage to a protected tree should occur during or as a result of work on the site, the contractor, builder or owner shall promptly notify the City of such damage. If such a protected tree cannot be preserved in a healthy state, the reviewing agency shall require replacement of any protected tree removed with another tree or trees on the same site deemed adequate to compensate for the loss of the tree that is removed.

D. Issuance of Permit. Consideration of and action on the permit application shall be made by the board or official to whom the permit application is routed in accordance with subsection (A)(2) of this section, and that board or official shall either approve, conditionally approve or deny the permit with reason for such action stated. If an application for tree removal/alteration is approved, a permit shall be issued to the applicant by the Community Development Department in conjunction with any other permit related to the work in question. However, no tree removal/alteration permit will be issued until all related building permits are approved.

E. Liabilities.

1. The issuance and exercise of a permit pursuant to this chapter shall not be deemed to establish any public use or access not already in existence with regard to the property to which the permit applies.

2. The issuance of a permit pursuant to this chapter shall not create any liability of the City with regard to the work to be performed, and the applicant for such permit shall hold harmless the City and its officers and employees from any damage or injury that may occur in connection with, or resulting from, such work.

F. Emergency Tree Removal or Alteration. If personal injury or property damage is imminently threatened (meaning that the likelihood of failure is “probable” or “imminent” and the risk (severity of consequences to life or property) if failure occurs is “high” or “extreme” using protocols established by the International Society of Arboriculture), the Fire Chief, the Chief of Police or the City Engineer in consultation with an arborist may authorize the removal or alteration of a protected tree without compliance with other provisions of this chapter. The removal or alteration of a protected tree under emergency conditions shall be reported to the Community Development Department on the first business day following the emergency tree work.

G. Public Utilities Pruning. A yearly tree removal permit shall be required for removal or alteration of protected trees as defined in this chapter by any public utility, emergencies excepted. This permit may be revoked at any time if the following conditions are not met:

1. The Community Development Department or Office of the City Engineer must be informed of all pruning, detailing street addresses, tree types and extent of work, two weeks in advance of the work date;

2. A weekly work location must be provided to the City Engineer for each crew so that the work can be supervised;

3. All work must be under the daily supervision of an arborist and the work actually performed by either an arborist or a tree worker; and

4. Defined pruning methods must be used for all utility pruning work; a copy is available at the Community Development Department and Office of the City Engineer.

H. Appeal of Denied Permit Applications. The decision of the Planning Commission is final with regard to applications subject to their jurisdiction. With regard to applications subject to the jurisdiction of the City Engineer the decision of the City Engineer may be appealed as follows:

The Community Development Department and Office of the City Engineer shall maintain a list of three arborists qualified to make determinations required of this section. Those on the list shall be arborists who have established through reputation in the community the ability to be fair and impartial in making determinations required in this section and who have agreed to serve as arbiters for the purpose of implementing this section. A party aggrieved by the decision of the City Engineer may request that the City select one of the three listed arbiters/arborists to reconsider the application (so long as the selected arbiter/arborist has had no prior involvement with the instant application). The aggrieved party will be required to pay the fee of the arbiter/arborist in advance and the City shall then select the arbiter from the list on a rotational basis. The arbiter/arborist will consider the merits of the application pursuant to the provisions of this section, and will render a decision in writing either approving the application, conditionally approving the application, or denying the application. The decision of the arbiter/arborist will be final.

There is no City Council appeal of the decision of any board, official or arbiter/arborist of any tree removal application made pursuant to this section. [Ord. 1246 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1114 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1107 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1050 § 1, 1989.]

11.12.040 Views.
A. Unreasonable Obstruction of View or Sunlight Prohibited. A tree, shrub, hedge, or other vegetation shall not be maintained in such manner as to unreasonably obstruct the view from or the sunlight reaching other property.

B. Procedure – Private Tree.

1. Initial Reconciliation. Any claimant who believes in good faith that the growth, maintenance and/or location of trees, shrubs, hedges or other vegetation situated on the property of another unreasonably diminishes the beneficial use, economic value, sunlight or enjoyment of the view from the claimant’s property shall notify the tree owner in writing of these concerns. The claimant should consult an arborist and obtain a report for a feasible solution to the view problem. The notification to the tree owner should include the arborist’s report, and should also be accompanied by personal discussions, if possible, to enable the claimant and the tree owner to attempt to reach a mutually agreeable solution, both long-term and short-term, to the alleged unreasonable obstruction. If any tree involved is a protected tree, a tree removal/alteration permit must be obtained prior to work being done.

2. Mediation. If the initial reconciliation attempt is unsuccessful, and all parcels involved are private property, the complaining party shall propose mediation. Acceptance of mediation shall be voluntary, but the tree owner shall have no more than 30 days from service of a written request for mediation to accept or reject the offer of mediation, unless otherwise extended by complainant. If mediation is accepted, the parties shall mutually agree upon a mediator within 10 days.

It is recommended that the services of a professionally trained mediator or mediation service be employed. The City shall provide, upon request, for review and consideration for selection by the parties a list of mediators and mediation services accompanied by the qualifications provided by such individuals or entities. The fee for mediation services will be determined by the mediator and the parties. The mediator shall not have the power to issue binding orders for restorative action but shall strive to enable the parties to resolve their dispute at this stage in order to eliminate the need for binding arbitration, fact finding and advisory decision, or litigation. If any tree involved is a protected tree, a tree removal/alteration permit must be obtained prior to work being done.

3. Arbitration. In those cases where the parties are unable to reach agreement through the initial reconciliation process or with the assistance of a mediator, either the claimant or the tree owner may offer in writing to the other party to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The initiating party shall serve on the other party by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, an agreement executed by the initiating party to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. If the non-initiating party concurs, he/she shall execute the agreement within 30 days from service. Failure to execute the agreement shall be deemed a rejection of binding arbitration.

If the agreement is accepted, the initiating party shall submit a view claim to the City of Sausalito Community Development Department. The filing fee for such a claim shall be established by the City Council. The Planning Commission serves as a board of arbitration at a noticed public meeting which shall be held within 45 days from the date of the filing of the view claim. The arbitration proceeding shall be based on available evidence and testimony. Either party to the action may either be represented by an arborist or present an arborist’s written report to the Planning Commission 15 days prior to the meeting date. The Planning Commission may recommend the services of other experts to either or all parties. Each party shall have the right to present witnesses and to question witnesses presented by any other party. The Planning Commission shall reasonably attempt, as a group, to inspect the premises of both the claimant and the tree owner(s) prior to the arbitration meeting.

The Planning Commission shall submit a written decision to the parties. The decision shall include the Planning Commission’s findings with respect to the standards listed in subsections (C)(3) and (4) of this section and required restorative actions. All mandated restorative actions shall be initiated within 30 days of the rendition of the arbitration report, unless the health of the growth involved mandates a later date. The written decision of the Planning Commission mandating restorative action shall constitute the tree removal/alteration permit required for the specified work. The decision of the Planning Commission shall be final and binding and enforceable pursuant to the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1280 et seq.

4. Fact Finding and Advisory Decision. In those cases where the parties are unable to reach agreement through the initial reconciliation process or with the assistance of a mediator or agree to binding arbitration, the claimant or the tree owner may elect fact finding and an advisory decision of the Planning Commission. The applicant shall submit a view claim to the City of Sausalito Community Development Department. The filing fee for such a claim shall be established by the City Council. The Planning Commission serves as the fact finding board and shall render an advisory decision to the parties. A noticed public meeting shall be held within 45 days from the date of the filing of the view claim. The proceeding shall be based on available evidence and testimony. Either party to the action may either be represented by an arborist or present an arborist’s written report to the Planning Commission 15 days prior to the meeting date. The Planning Commission may recommend the services of other experts to either or all parties. The Planning Commission shall reasonably attempt as a group to inspect the premises of both the claimant and the tree owner(s) prior to the arbitration meeting.

The proceeding need not be postponed if any party refuses permission to inspect the premises or refuses to participate in the proceeding and produce evidence.

The Planning Commission shall submit a written advisory decision to the parties. The decision shall include the Planning Commission’s findings with respect to the standards listed in subsections (C)(3) and (4) of this section and recommended restorative actions as well as recommending allocation of costs for the same. In the event litigation is required to enforce the decision of the Planning Commission, there shall be a rebuttable presumption in favor of the Planning Commission’s decision. The party bringing any private civil action under this chapter must promptly notify the City of Sausalito Community Development Department in writing of such action. Such notification shall be placed in the property file of the properties where the trees are located.

C. Arbitration of View Claim.

1. Responsibility of Claimant in Arbitration. The claimant shall submit a view claim on a form prescribed by the City. The report of an arborist shall be submitted with the view claim. If the claimant is not the owner of the property to be benefited by the claim, the claimant shall attach the written permission of the affected property owner.

2. Responsibilities of Planning Commission in Arbitration. The Planning Commission:

a. Shall conduct a site visit as a group to properties involved.

b. May request additional data.

c. Shall conduct a public hearing on the view claim. At least 10 days prior to the hearing, notice shall be mailed to the affected parties and to the owners of the property within a radius of 100 feet of the boundaries of the property upon which the trees are located. Notice of the hearing shall also be published and posted at City Hall at least 10 days prior to the hearing.

d. Shall record in the County Recorder’s office any final decision of the Planning Commission which provides for limitations on the property of a tree owner.

3. Standards for Resolution of Claims in Arbitration. The Planning Commission shall, as a group, inspect the premises of both claimant(s) and tree owner(s) to verify the nature and extent of the alleged view obstruction. For purposes of this section, the Planning Commission and/or any involved arborist may enter upon the property of either or both parties. The Planning Commission shall evaluate the standards set forth below based on the site visit, the property file on record at City Hall, the submitted data and the public meeting:

a. The character of the view:

i. The vantage point from which the view is sought.

ii. The extent to which the view might be diminished by factors other than growth involved in the claim.

iii. The extent of the view that existed at the time claimant(s) purchased the property. (Is the party attempting to create, enhance or restore a view?)

b. The character of the view obstruction:

i. The extent of the alleged view obstruction as percentage of the total view (estimate).

ii. The impact on the beneficial use, economic value and enjoyment of the claimant’s property caused by the growth.

c. The extent of benefits and/or burdens derived from the growth in question:

i. The visual quality, including but not limited to species, size, growth, form and vigor.

ii. Location with respect to overall appearance, design and/or use of the tree owner’s property.

iii. Visual, auditory, and wind screening and privacy provided by the growth to the owner and the neighbors.

iv. Effects on neighboring vegetation provided by the growth.

v. The impact of the beneficial use, economic value and enjoyment of the tree owner’s property caused by the growth.

d. Restorative actions shall be limited to the following:

i. No action.

ii. Thinning to reduce density, e.g., open windows.

iii. Shaping to reduce height or spread, using thinning cuts only (drop crotch).

iv. Heading or topping.

v. Tree removal with necessary replacement planting.

e. Each type of restorative action shall be evaluated based on the above findings and with consideration given to the following factors:

i. The effectiveness of the restorative action in restoring the view.

ii. Any adverse impact of the restorative action on the benefits derived from the growth in question.

iii. The cost of the restorative action as obtained from the view claim. The Planning Commission may determine that additional estimates are required.

iv. The effects upon the privacy of the tree owner. Values of quiet and privacy should receive equal consideration with values of view and sunlight.

f. All restorative actions shall be undertaken with consideration given to the following factors:

i. All restorative actions must be consistent with subsections (C)(3)(d) and (e) of this section.

ii. Restorative actions shall be limited to shaping, thinning, and/or heading of branches where possible.

iii. When shaping and/or thinning of branches is not a feasible solution, heading or topping shall be preferable to tree removal if it is determined that the impact of topping does not destroy the visual proportions of the tree, adversely affect the tree’s growth pattern or health, or otherwise constitute a detriment to the tree in question (arborist’s advice required).

iv. Tree removal shall only be considered when all other restorative actions are judged to be ineffective. Replacement planting can be required on the property of the parties.

v. An arborist’s report is required in determining the nature and cost of replacement plant materials, installation of such plant materials, and time required for such plant materials to become well established.

vi. In those cases where tree removal eliminates or significantly reduces the tree owner’s benefit of visual screening, wind screening or privacy, replacement screen plantings shall, at the tree owner’s option, be established prior to tree removal; notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (C)(3)(e) of this section, the tree owner may elect tree removal with replacement planting as an alternative to shaping, thinning, heading or topping.

vii. All shaping, thinning, heading, topping and tree removal required under this chapter must be performed under the daily supervision of an arborist.

4. Implementation of Decision. Within 30 days of the arbitration decision, the tree owner will obtain at least three bids for the prescribed work from arborists and shall present all bids to claimant. Within 15 days after presentation of the bids, the claimant shall deposit with the tree owner an amount equal to the percentage of the lowest bid deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission. The tree owner shall, at his or her sole discretion, choose the company by which he or she wishes the work done and shall order the work done within 15 days after receiving the claimant’s deposit. The tree owner shall pay the difference between the deposit amount and the bid amount of the company he has chosen. The authorized work of correction shall be done by an arborist under the sole direction and control of the tree owner.

5. Allocation of Costs in Arbitration. To be determined by the arbitration commission according to the standards set forth under subsections (C)(3) and (4) of this section, and the individual circumstances brought before the commission.

1. Filing of View Claim. A claimant who believes in good faith that the growth, maintenance, or location of trees situated on City property diminishes the beneficial use, economic value, sunlight, or enjoyment of views naturally accruing to the claimant’s property may apply to the City on a form approved by the City. The application form shall be accompanied by a filing fee as established by the City Council. If the claimant is not the owner of the property that is proposed to benefit from this claim, the claimant shall attach the written permission of the property owner.

2. Investigation. Upon receipt of a view claim, the City Engineer, in consultation with an arborist acting on behalf of the City, shall investigate the claim and shall consider the public interest in maintaining the public environment created by the existing trees and landscaping; additionally, the City Engineer may take into consideration the standards set forth in subsection (C)(3) of this section and shall issue his or her decision to the claimant within 30 days of receiving the view claim. The decision of the City Engineer shall be in writing but no findings are required. Appeal of the decision of the City Engineer shall be as set forth in SMC 11.12.030(H).

3. Public Posting and Input. All City trees affected by a view claim shall be individually tagged by the City within five working days of receipt of a complete view claim.

11.20.010 Finding and intent.
The City Council finds and declares that:

A. Solid waste that is not recyclable, reusable or biodegradable poses a problem for environmentally and financially responsible solid waste management programs.

B. Discarded packaging from foods and beverages constitutes a significant and growing portion of the waste in the Marin County waste stream.

C. Plastic packaging is rapidly replacing other packaging material, and most plastic packaging used for foods and beverages is not recyclable, reusable, biodegradable, or returnable.

D. Disposable plastic containers, bags, wrappers and other packaging used for take-out foods are largely not biodegradable and as waste do not decompose over time in the natural environment and the use of these containers and wrappers has become increasingly prevalent.

E. Plastic litter, including polystyrene foam, poses a potential threat to wildlife. It enters the marine and natural environment and is ingested by or entangles aquatic wildlife, frequently causing death, and damages the ecological balance.

F. Products which are biodegradable, reusable or recyclable offer environmentally sound alternatives to nonbiodegradable, nonreusable and nonrecyclable products currently used. By decaying into their constituent substances, biodegradable products are less of a danger to the natural environment, and less of a permanent blight on the landscape.

G. Polystyrene foam litter, in particular, is highly durable, buoyant and nonbiodegradable and therefore persists and detracts from the appearance of the area longer than many other types of litter.

H. Recycling and reuse of products reduces the costly waste of natural resources and energy used in production of new products as well as costly disposal of waste in landfills.

I. Although the waste stream within Marin County is large and diverse, steps at the local level, no matter how small, can significantly support waste management programs in lieu of landfilling.

J. The provisions of this chapter are consistent with and help implement the County solid waste management plan, and the legislative findings and intent of AB939.

K. Intention of This Chapter.

1. The purpose of this law is to eliminate the use of nonbiodegradable, nonreusable, nonreturnable, and nonrecyclable packaging originating at establishments and events within the City of Sausalito to the maximum extent practicable to promote public health, conserve energy and resources, reduce solid waste and litter, and protect wildlife and the environment.

2. The provisions of this chapter will serve the public interest by reducing both nonbiodegradable litter and the quantity of nonbiodegradable waste in the landfills serving Sausalito. Maximizing the operating life of landfill facilities promotes the public interest. [Ord. 1188 § 1(Exh. A), 2007; Ord. 1060 § 1, 1990.]

If a food establishment has in its employ one or more persons who are being allowed by the Health Officer to continue to work pending completion of tests to determine the presence or absence of contagious tuberculosis, such establishment shall be issued a certificate that shall expire at a date determined by the Health Officer but not later than three months from date of issuance.

A certificate may be suspended by the Health Officer for violation of any provision of this chapter, but not until after the holder has been given an opportunity for a hearing before the Health Officer, except that a certificate shall be immediately suspended if employees with contagious tuberculosis or other communicable disease are not immediately excluded from the food establishment as ordered by the Health Officer. After the hearing a reasonable time shall be allowed by the Health Officer for correction of the violations. During that correctional period the certificate may be suspended, and the food establishment may be ordered closed during the suspension if the Health Officer deems such action necessary for the protection of the public health. The suspension shall be lifted if full compliance with sanitary requirements is obtained at the end of the time allowed; if compliance is not obtained, the certificate shall then be revoked. [Ord. 607 § 2, 1962.]

12.08.060 Personnel requirements after certification of establishment.

12.20.010 Nuisance defined.
A nuisance is defined as being any act which is declared to be a nuisance by the provisions of Title 1 of Part 3 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or by any other provision of the laws of the State, or by any ordinance of the City. In addition, a nuisance is declared to include any thing, act or condition on the property lying within or adjacent to the City, which renders any property within the City dangerous or harmful to persons who may occupy or go upon such property within the City. [Ord. 826 § 1, 1973.]

12.20.020 Notification of property owner.
Whenever any such nuisance exists, any officer or employee of the City may give notice in the manner hereinafter stated directing the owner (as the owner is shown by the last equalized assessment roll) of the property to appear before the City Council at a stated time and show cause why such nuisance shall not be abated. The notice shall describe the property by reference to its assessor’s parcel number and shall describe the nuisance alleged to exist thereon. The notice shall be posted conspicuously on the property and a copy thereof shall be mailed, postage prepaid, addressed to the owner at the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll. Such posting and mailing shall be completed not later than seven days prior to the date that the matter is to be heard by the City Council. [Ord. 826 § 2, 1973.]

12.20.030 Hearing of evidence relating to nuisance.
At the time fixed in the notice, the Council shall proceed to hear evidence relating to the nuisance. The Council may continue the hearing from time to time. If the owner fails to appear at the time fixed for the hearing, or at any time to which the hearing may be continued, such failure to appear shall not deprive the Council of its jurisdiction to determine the matter. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council may adopt a resolution declaring the condition to constitute a nuisance and directing the owner to abate the same within a reasonable period. In determining the period for abatement of such nuisance, the City Council may consider, among other things, the imminence of the danger involved. In its resolution, the City Council may direct that any officer or employee of the City shall abate the nuisance in the event that the owner fails to abate the same within the period prescribed by the Council. [Ord. 826 § 3, 1973.]

12.20.040 Cost assessment and responsibility when nuisance abated by City.
In the event that the owner fails to abate the nuisance as directed by the City Council, and the City is required to abate the same, the expense of abatement thereof shall constitute a personal obligation of the property owner and the City Council may assess the cost of such abatement as a special assessment against the land. Prior to making such assessment, the City Council shall give notice in writing to the owner of the property at his address shown on the last equalized assessment roll of the time when the Council will meet to consider making such assessment. The notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, at least seven days prior to the date of such hearing. Any such special assessment shall be certified by the City Council to the tax collector of the County and shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment. [Ord. 826 § 4, 1973.]

12.20.050 Summary abatement of immediate hazard or threat.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, when any nuisance constitutes an immediate hazard or threat to the safety of person or property, the City Manager may direct any officer or employee of the City to summarily abate the nuisance. In such event, the provisions of SMC 12.20.020 shall not apply, but the City Council may nevertheless proceed to make the cost of such abatement a special assessment against the property as provided in SMC 12.20.040, and the expense of abatement of such nuisance shall constitute a personal obligation of the property owner.

The new tobacco retailer’s license will retain the same expiration date as the previous one.

4. A new tobacco retailer’s license is required whenever the tobacco retailer location has a change in proprietor(s). Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, prior violations at a location shall continue to be counted against a location and license ineligibility periods shall continue to apply to a location unless the new proprietor(s) provide the City with clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor(s) have acquired or are acquiring the location in an arm’s length transaction.

D. Fee for License. The fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer’s license shall be $50.00 or as otherwise established from time to time by resolution of the City Council. The fee shall be calculated so as to recover the cost of administration and enforcement of this section.

Chapter 12.36
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS
Sections:

12.36.010    Reasonable accommodations.

12.36.010 Reasonable accommodations.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a procedure for requesting reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning and building laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures.

B. Applicability.

1. Definition of Disability. Under the Acts, an individual with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone with a record of such impairment. Individuals in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse are protected by Federal and State fair housing laws although individuals currently using illegal substances are not protected under the law unless they have a separate disability. This chapter is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts.

2. Scope of Accommodation. A request for a reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide an individual with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made in the manner prescribed by subsection D of this section (Application Contents and Submittal), and shall not require a fundamental alteration to the City’s zoning or building laws, policies, and/or procedures, as defined under the Acts. A modification approved under this chapter is considered a personal accommodation for the individual applicant and does not run with the land.

3. Eligibility to Request Accommodation. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a land use, zoning or building regulation, policy, practice or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.

C. Notice to the Public of Availability of Accommodation Process. Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be displayed at the public information counter in the Community Development Department advising the public of the availability of the procedure for eligible individuals. Forms for requesting reasonable accommodation shall also be made available.

D. Application Contents and Submittal. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted on an application form provided by the Community Development Department and shall contain the following information:

1. The applicant’s name, address and telephone number.

2. Address of the property for which the request is being made, and the name, address and telephone number of the property owner.

3. The current existing use of the property.

4. The basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled under the Acts.

5. The zoning code provision, regulation or policy from which reasonable accommodation is being requested.

6. Reason the requested accommodation may be necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual.

E. Authority.

1. Community Development Director. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the Community Development Director if no approval is sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation.

2. Other Review Authority. Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the authority reviewing the discretionary land use application.

F. Review Procedure.

1. Director Review. The Community Development Director, or his/her designee, shall make a written determination within 45 days of submittal of a complete application and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with subsection G of this section (Findings). The Director shall mail a notice of a request for reasonable accommodation to contiguous owners of property, as shown on the latest equalized Marin County assessment roll, but may include other property owners as determined by the Director. Said notice shall be mailed at least 10 days prior to making a determination.

2. Other Reviewing Authority. Written determinations on requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be made by the authority responsible for reviewing the discretionary land use application. The written determination to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made in accordance with subsection G of this section (Findings).

3. Additional Information. If necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may request further information from the applicant consistent with the Acts, specifying in detail the information that is required. In the event that a request for additional information is made, the 45-day period to issue a decision is stayed until the applicant responds to the request.

4. The reviewing authority may approve an alternative reasonable accommodation that provides the applicant an opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling equivalent to that provided by the specific accommodation requested, where such an alternative accommodation would:

a. Reduce impacts to neighboring properties or the surrounding area; or

b. Not require a deviation from the provisions of SMC Title 8 or 10 or would require less of a deviation than the requested accommodation.

G. Findings. The reasonable accommodation shall be approved, with or without conditions, if the reviewing authority finds, based upon all of the evidence presented, that all of the following findings can be made:

1. The housing, which is the subject of the request, will be occupied by an individual considered disabled under the Acts.

2. The requested accommodation is necessary to provide a disabled individual with an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

3. The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City, as defined under the Acts.

4. The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration to the City’s zoning or building laws, policies, and/or procedures, as defined under the Acts. In considering whether the accommodation would require such a fundamental alteration, the reviewing authority may consider, among other factors:

a. Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood; and

b. Whether the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either Sausalito’s General Plan or an applicable specific plan.

5. There are no other reasonable accommodation(s) that would allow the applicant to use and enjoy the dwelling which would:

a. Be less impactful to neighboring properties or the surrounding area; or

b. Not require a deviation from the provisions of SMC Title 8 or 10 or would require less of a deviation than the requested accommodation.

H. Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required by subsection G of this section, including but not limited to the following:

1. Inspection of the property periodically, as specified, to verify compliance with this section and any conditions of approval.

2. Recordation of a deed restriction requiring removal of the improvements when the need for which the accommodation was granted no longer exists, except where the Director finds that removal would constitute an unreasonable financial burden and/or is physically integrated with the structure and cannot feasibly be removed.

3. Time limits and/or expiration of the approval if the need for which the accommodation was granted no longer exists.

4. Measures to reduce the impact on surrounding uses.

5. Measures in consideration of the physical attributes of the property and structures.

6. Other conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

I. Written Decision. The written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation shall explain in detail the basis of the decision, including the reviewing authority’s findings required by subsection G of this section (Findings). All written decisions shall give notice of the applicant’s right to appeal and to request reasonable accommodation in the appeals process as set forth below.

J. Appeals. A determination by the reviewing authority to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation may be in compliance with Chapter 10.84 SMC (Appeals). Appeals shall be submitted on an application form provided by the Community Development Department. If an individual needs assistance in filing an appeal on an adverse decision, the City will provide assistance to ensure the appeals process is accessible. [Ord. 1221 § 1, 2014.]

The purposes of this chapter are:

A. To protect the public health, safety and general welfare;

B. To promote the reduction of underage drinking, marijuana use, and controlled substance use by imposing an administrative fine on persons responsible for loud or unruly gatherings where alcohol, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are consumed by, served to, or in the possession of underage persons;

C. To facilitate the enforcement of laws prohibiting the service to, consumption of, or possession of alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances by underage persons;

D. To offset the municipal costs associated with providing fire, police, and other emergency services to loud or unruly gatherings, by imposing a civil fee upon social hosts and/or landowners who knowingly allow such loud or unruly gatherings to occur on their premises, at their residences, in vehicles including rented buses or limousines, or at rented facilities where alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of underage persons.

E. Current State law prohibiting conduct that contributes to the delinquency of a minor does not address liability for allowing the consumption of alcohol, controlled substances, and/or marijuana by persons who are 18 years of age or older on premises under the control of an adult. [Ord. 1263 § 2, 2018; Ord. 1189 § 1, 2008.]

13.32.020 Legislative findings.
The City Council finds as follows:

A. The City of Sausalito, pursuant to the police powers delegated to it by the California Constitution, has the authority to enact laws which promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its residents;

B. The occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons is harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a public nuisance;

C. Local jurisdictions throughout the County of Marin have made numerous and substantial efforts to enforce underage drinking, marijuana, and controlled substance laws. Despite these efforts, use by youth remains a serious problem in the County, contributing significantly to the incidence of adolescent crime, addiction, sexual assault, truancy, driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, and/or controlled substances, and motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol, marijuana, and/or controlled substances and causing injury and/or death;

D. Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the service to, possession by, and/or consumption of alcohol by underage persons. Persons responsible for the occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons at these gatherings;

E. Residents have failed to prevent the occurrence or reoccurrence of loud or unruly gatherings, including those where alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons, on private property, which seriously disrupts neighboring residents’ quiet enjoyment of their property;

F. Control of loud or unruly gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons is necessary when such activity is determined to be a public nuisance;

G. Persons held responsible for abetting or allowing loud or unruly gatherings where alcohol, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons will be more likely to properly supervise or to stop such conduct at gatherings held on property in their possession or under their control;

H. In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel have responded and are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to loud or unruly gatherings on private property at which alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons, and responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the City, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the City by its taxpayers and residents, and also result in a delay of responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the City;

I. Problems associated with loud or unruly gatherings at which alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless the City has the legal authority to issue an administrative citation for an administrative fine;

J. The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property, and general welfare;

K. Section 25658 of the State of California Business and Professions Code makes it unlawful for a person under the age of 21 years to purchase, or attempt to purchase, or consume alcoholic beverages and makes it unlawful for any person to sell any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years;

L. According to local, State and Federal surveys, alcohol is overwhelmingly and consistently the most widely used drug at all adolescent age levels. A child who begins alcohol use prior to age 15 is four times as likely to experience alcohol dependence than one who refrains from alcohol use until age 20 or older;

M. This City Council of the City of Sausalito therefore determines that this chapter is a reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the youth and other residents of the City of Sausalito. [Ord. 1263 § 2, 2018; Ord. 1189 § 1, 2008.]

The provisions of this section providing authority for the removal of specified vehicles or parts thereof from any public or private property are intended to supplement and not replace any other provisions of State or local law which provide authority for the removal of vehicles from any public or private property. The provisions of this section provide an alternative means to any other provision of law which may provide for the removal of vehicles or parts thereof affected by its provisions.

B. Any vehicle which is a public nuisance as defined by SMC 15.08.010(A) may be removed from public or private property in accordance with the provisions of this section.

C.1. A 10-day notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or part thereof as a public nuisance shall be mailed, by registered or certified mail, to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owner of record unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. Such notice shall contain a statement of the hearing rights of the owner of the property and the owner of the vehicle and shall include notice to the property owner that he/she may appear in person at a hearing or may present a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his or her reasons for such denial, in lieu of appearing.

2. The notice required by this subsection shall not be required if the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal of the vehicle and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof.

3. The notice required by this subsection shall not be required for removal of a vehicle or part thereof which is located on property zoned agriculture or which is not improved with a residential structure containing as least one dwelling unit and which is inoperable due to the absence of a motor, transmission, or wheels and incapable of being towed, is valued at less than $200.00 by a person specified in CVC Section 22855, and is determined by the Police Department to be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public peace, health or safety; provided, that the property owner has signed a release authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof.

If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land within the 10-day period, that statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting the statement. If no request for a hearing is made within the 10-day period, the Police Department shall be empowered to remove the vehicle. At the hearing, the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located shall be permitted to appear in person or present a written sworn statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his or her reasons for such denial. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the owner, and that the owner has not subsequently acquiesced in the presence of the vehicle on the property, then the City shall not assess costs of administration or the removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located nor shall the City make any other attempt to collect such cost from such owner.

E.

F. Within five days after a vehicle is removed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Police Department shall notify the State Department of Motor Vehicles, identifying the vehicle or part thereof and providing any evidence of registration available, including, but not limited to, the registration card, certificates of ownership, or license plate.

The application shall be denied if it appears to the City Building Inspector or the City Engineer from the investigation that such excavation would remove the lateral and subjacent support of the adjacent land or would result in a dangerous topographic condition, or result in seepage or slides, or would improperly divert the flow of drainage waters, or would create or increase an attractive nuisance dangerous to public safety, or would otherwise in any manner endanger the public health or safety, or be detrimental to the public welfare, despite all precautions which the applicant is willing, ready and able to take. [Ord. 1201 § 1, 2010; Ord. 437 § 4, 1951.]

17.08.050 Certificate of insurance may be required.

17.08.070 Revocation or suspension of permit – Appeal.
Any permit granted under this chapter may be revoked or suspended by the City Building Inspector, as in his discretion may seem reasonable and just, for any reason for which the issuance of such permit might lawfully be denied, or for any failure to comply with any of the terms of this chapter or of such permit. Appeal to set aside any revocation or suspension of permit may be made in writing to the City Council. [Ord. 1201 § 1, 2010; Ord. 437 § 7, 1951.]

17.08.080 Expiration of permits – Supplemental permit issuance procedure.
In the event that any work for which a permit has been granted under this chapter is not commenced within six months from the date of issuance of the permit, or in the event that work on said excavation or fill is at any time abandoned for a period of six consecutive months, the permit shall automatically expire, without notice, and no further work covered by the permit shall be done; however, the conditions expressed in the permit shall remain binding upon the person to whom such a permit was issued, and all legal and equitable remedies shall be available against him for any breach thereof. When the amount of material excavated or the fill equals the number of cubic yards which the permit authorizes to be excavated or filled, no further excavation or fill may be made until a new or supplemental permit to excavate has been issued. In either event, an application for a supplemental permit to continue or enlarge the excavation or fill may be filed, setting forth all the information required in the original application. If such supplemental permit is issued, the applicant shall pay an additional inspection fee at the rate of $0.01 per cubic yard. [Ord. 1201 § 1, 2010; Ord. 437 § 8, 1951.]

17.18.070    Findings required.

17.18.080    Record of vacation.

17.18.010 Statement of policy on right-of-way vacations.
Allowing limited, conditional, private use of public right-of-way property through the encroachment permit process set forth in Chapter 17.16 SMC and other City laws is favored over the vacation of the City’s legal interest in such property. Further, the public use of pedestrian stairway and pathway rights-of-way shall be respected in considering requests for vacation. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.020 Authorized interested persons – Written application.
Requests that the City vacate all or part of a public right-of-way shall be made exclusively through written application to the City’s Community Development Director by interested persons. “Interested persons” are defined as the owner(s), or their authorized representative(s), of a parcel or parcels which are contiguous to the part of the public right-of-way sought to be vacated. Each written application shall include, at a minimum, the following information:

A. A general and legal description of the right-of-way, or portion thereof, proposed to be vacated together with a map or plan which illustrates the extent of the vacation in relation to the right-of-way, public service easements, if any, and the contiguous properties.

B. An independent, written title report to determine ownership interests in the right-of-way, or portion thereof, proposed to be vacated, and the contiguous property or properties. The title report shall be issued by a title insurance company licensed and admitted to conduct business by the State of California.

C. A statement describing how the right-of-way sought to be vacated is unnecessary for present or prospective public use.

D. A deposit of the fee required pursuant to SMC 17.18.030.

E. If applicable, a statement and any accompanying documentary proof that the request for vacation is prompted by error, safety or hardship as described in SMC 17.18.055, and is eligible for expedited review under that section. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.030 Fee required.
A processing fee representing the estimate of the reasonable City costs incurred in processing the application shall be required to be deposited with the City in order for the application to be complete. The amount of the fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council adopted from time to time. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.040 Acceptance of application – Planning Commission review.
The City’s Community Development Director, the City Engineer and other staff shall review the application for completeness. The City shall seek input from the holders of any public service easements to determine if there are any adverse effects of the requested vacation upon these public service easements and the City may make changes or conditions to the requested vacation accordingly. Environmental inspections and/or review, if required, shall be conducted. Once the application is determined complete by City staff, it shall be submitted to the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall set the matter for consideration by the Planning Commission solely to determine if the location, purpose and extent of the vacation conforms with the City’s general plan under Government Code Section 65402. The date the Planning Commission renders its determination shall initiate the proceedings for purposes of taking the vacation request to the City Council. At the Community Development Director’s discretion, the City may combine several vacation applications and present them to the Planning Commission or City Council in the same proceeding. At the conclusion of the Planning Commission proceedings, the City Clerk shall set the City Council public hearing date and follow the procedures set forth in SMC 17.18.060. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.050 Appraisal required.
Unless exempt pursuant to SMC 17.18.055, an independent, written appraisal to determine the value of the right-of-way, or portion thereof, proposed to be vacated shall be obtained by the City prior to consideration of the request to vacate by the City Council. The right-of-way shall be valued at the same unit value of the contiguous property or properties for its highest and best use as if both the right-of-way to be vacated and the contiguous property or properties are vacant. That is, the appraisal shall consider the value of the right-of-way to be vacated irrespective of the existence of any improvements or structures. The applicant shall bear the cost of the appraisal. The City may combine several vacation applications in order to reduce and distribute the appraisal cost among several applicants. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.055 Expedited review in instances of error, safety or hardship.
Expedited review of vacation applications means the application, once complete, proceeds directly to the Planning Commission under SMC 17.18.040 and is exempt from the appraisal requirement under SMC 17.18.050.

In order to qualify for expedited review, the application must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that one or more of the following conditions exists:

A. An error exists in title to the right-of-way proposed for vacation. An “error” is defined as a mistake in the legal description of the right-of-way, in the chain of title to the right-of-way, or in the property boundaries of the right-of-way, for example, by conflicts between metes and bounds descriptions, physical monuments, recorded maps or deeds or other recorded instruments. The error may be shown by a survey prepared at the sole cost of the applicant by a surveyor licensed by the State of California Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. The error must be described in detail and substantiated in writing by an opinion of a title insurance company licensed to do business in the State of California.

B. The existence of the right-of-way proposed for vacation poses a serious, hazardous threat to the safety of the public or to the safety of the persons or property upon the property or properties. The safety hazards must be described in detail and attested in writing by the applicant under penalty of perjury. An example of a serious safety hazard would be a landslide or an imminent landslide.

C. The existence of the right-of-way proposed for vacation poses an unreasonable hardship on the applicants if the vacation were not granted by the City. The instances of hardship must be described in detail and attested in writing by the applicant under penalty of perjury. An example of a hardship would be proof of substantial economic loss and/or unreasonable restraint against alienation if the vacation were not granted, and no other reasonable alternative exists such as issuance of an encroachment permit. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.060 City Council procedure.
The Community Development Director shall comply with the State law procedures for vacations, including without limitation the procedures set forth in the public streets, highways, and service easements vacation law (California Streets and Highways Code Sections 8300 and following). A public hearing is required before the City Council, and the City Clerk shall cause legal notice to be provided. Notice shall include mailed notice to all properties within 300 feet of the right-of-way proposed to be vacated providing two weeks’ notice of the public hearing date. At the Community Development Director’s discretion, the City may combine several vacation applications and present them to the City Council in the same proceeding. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.070 Findings required.
The City Council shall not adopt a resolution approving a vacation unless it finds as follows:

A. The right-of-way to be vacated, or portion thereof, is unnecessary for present or prospective public use.

B. The vacation conforms to the City’s general plan, including the circulation element.

C. The vacation serves the public interests to a degree greater than if the private use of the right-of-way was conferred by encroachment permit.

D. Adequate consideration has been offered in exchange for vacating the public’s interest in the affected right-of-way. The adequacy of the consideration is not limited to monetary remuneration and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of the City Council. The Council may consider such factors as the appraised value of the vacated right-of-way, the use which the applicant is to make of the vacated right-of-way, and whether the loss of the public’s interest in the vacated right-of-way is offset by the increase in the public’s welfare, health or safety attributable to the applicant’s combined use of the vacated right-of-way and the properties contiguous to it.

E. On a case-by-case basis, the Council may determine that the vacated right-of-way shall not be used by the applicant or its successor to satisfy any development or building requirements associated with the contiguous parcel or parcels, for example to increase the development potential of the contiguous parcel or parcels, such as an increase in floor area ratio or lot coverage.

F. The vacation shall not unreasonably interfere with the viability of the remaining right-of-way nor public service easements in proximity thereto.

G. In order to render any one or more of the findings in this section, the Council may impose conditions upon the vacation, including without limitation the requirement of the applicant to pay compensation; the requirement that the applicant release and indemnify the City from liability, including environmental liability, and liability which may relate to neighboring properties; the requirement that the applicant maintain the vacated property; and the requirement that the vacation is subject to certain defined reservations and exceptions. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

17.18.080 Record of vacation.
To the extent the Council approves or conditionally approves the vacation, the decision shall be made by resolution and shall be recorded in the Marin County Recorder’s office together with any deeds or other instruments which may be required by law. The property vacated shall not be considered surplus property of the City. [Ord. 1150 § 2, 2000.]

[Ord. 1162 § 1(Exh. A), 2002.]

17.32.070 Action on application.
The City Manager shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application for the grounds specified in SMC 17.32.080. Such action shall be taken no later than 30 days after receiving a completed application unless the applicant waives time. Notice of the City Manager’s decision shall be delivered personally to the applicant or mailed to the applicant’s address. If the application is denied, the City Manager shall inform the applicant of the grounds for a change in the date, time, route or location of the event, and of his/her right of appeal. If the City Manager refuses to consider a late application under SMC 17.32.050, the City Manager shall inform the applicant of his/her reason for the refusal, and of his/her right of appeal.

The decision made by the City Manager to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application shall be communicated to the City Council as soon as the item can be placed on the agenda for a regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council. [Ord. 1162 § 1(Exh. A), 2002.]

17.32.080 Grounds for denial of application for a special event permit.
A. The City Manager shall approve an application for a special event permit unless he/she determines from consideration of the application, or other pertinent information, that any of the following conditions exist:

1. Information contained in the application, or supplemental information requested from the applicant, is found to be false in any material detail.

2. The applicant fails to complete all or a portion of the application form after having been requested to do so.

3. Another special event permit application has been received prior in time, or has already been approved, to hold another special event at the same time and place requested by the applicant, or so close in time and place as to cause undue traffic congestion, or the police are unable to meet the needs for police services for both special events. This subsection shall not be grounds for denial of a special event permit if the impact of the additional special event is minimal or insignificant in conjunction with the concurrently held event. Applicants for proposed concurrently held special events are encouraged to cooperate and coordinate with each other in order to reduce any potential impacts.

4. The time, route or size of the special event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion.

5. The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of the special event or the assembly and disbanding areas around a special event will prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services to areas contiguous to the special event.

6. The size or nature of the special event will require the assignment of so great a number of City police officers to properly police the line of movement of a special event, or the boundaries of areas contiguous to a special event, as to prevent normal police protection to the rest of the City. Nothing in this section authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect participants from the conduct of others, if reasonable permit conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection of special event participants with the number of police officers available to police the special event.

7. The location of the special event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the City streets, or a previously granted encroachment permit.

8. The special event shall occur at a time when a school is in session at a route or location adjacent to the school or class thereof, and the noise created by the activities of the special event would substantially disrupt the educational activities of the school or class thereof.

9. The applicant or sponsoring organization has outstanding past due debts to the City in excess of $1,000 unless the event is solely for the purpose of exercising the right of free speech.

B. When the grounds for denial of an application for permit specified in subsections (A)(4) through (A)(9) of this section can be corrected by altering the date, time, duration, route or location of the special event, the City Manager shall instead of denying the application conditionally approve the application upon the applicant’s acceptance of conditions for permit issuance. [Ord. 1162 § 1(Exh. A), 2002.]

17.32.090 Permit conditions.
The City Manager may condition the issuance of a special event permit by imposing reasonable requirements concerning the time, place and manner of the special event, and such requirements as are necessary to protect the safety of persons and property, and the control of traffic; provided, that such conditions shall not unreasonably restrict the right of free speech. Such conditions include:

A. Alteration of the route, time or location of the event proposed on the event application.

B. Conditions concerning the area of assembly and disbanding of parades or other special events occurring along a route.

C. Conditions concerning accommodation of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including restricting the event to only a portion of a street transversed.

D. Requirements for the use of traffic cones or barricades.

E. Requirements for provisions of first aid or sanitary facilities.

J. Requirements for the use of recyclable and/or compostable products as established by City policy.

In the event that such restrictions are imposed, the City Manager may, in his/her sole and absolute discretion, waive the application of Chapter 12.16 SMC, Noise Control, to the special event.

L. Requiring that the public be notified of the special event in specified publication(s) of general circulation in the City prior to the special event.

M. An application for a special event permit to conduct a block party may be conditioned on notice and approval by 50 percent of the residents of dwellings along the affected street(s). Block parties must be located in a cul-de-sac or specified area to be approved.

N. Compliance with any relevant ordinance or law and obtaining any legally required permit or license.

O. Required proof of permission to use private property for a portion of the event.

P. Require monitored bicycle parking at special events with anticipated attendance of over 1,000 people. The sponsor of the special event may provide such monitoring service or ensure that such monitored bicycle parking is available at local facilities. If the sponsor provides monitored bicycle parking, the sponsor may charge a nominal fee for such service. The amount of such fee shall be stated as part of the sponsor’s permit application. If the sponsor is unable to ascertain the fee amount at the time of the permit application, the sponsor may submit a fee schedule to the City as soon as possible, but no later than 10 days before the event.

Q. The permittee/sponsor of the special event meet with the City Manager and/or other designated City staff within 30 days after the occurrence of the special event to discuss the manner in which the special event was conducted, the impact on City property and the provision of City services, and, if the special event is reoccurring, any proposed changes to such special events to be held in the future. [Ord. 1162 § 1(Exh. A), 2002.]

17.32.100 Appeal procedure.

The agreement shall also provide that the permittee/ sponsoring organization shall defend the City, its officers, agents, employees, volunteers, elected and appointed officials, and representatives against, and indemnify and hold the City, its officers, agents, employees, volunteers and representatives harmless from, any liability to any persons resulting from any damage or injury in connection with the event proximately caused by the actions of the permittee/sponsoring organization, its officers, employees, elected and appointed officials, volunteers, or agents, or any person who was or reasonably should have been under the permittee’s/ sponsoring organization’s control. [Ord. 1162 § 1(Exh. A), 2002.]

17.32.130 Insurance.
A. The applicant/sponsor of a special event must possess or obtain liability insurance to protect against loss from liability imposed by law for damages on account of bodily injury and property damage arising from the special event.

Insurance coverage must be maintained for the duration of the special event.

B. Coverage shall be provided by a comprehensive automobile and general liability insurance policy in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence as determined by the City Manager. Such coverage shall apply as primary insurance. Any other insurance maintained by the City, its officers, agents, representatives, elected and appointed officials, volunteers and employees, shall be excess only and not contributing with insurance provided under the policy. Such insurance policies shall not be canceled or materially changed without 30 days’ advance written notice to the City at City Hall, attention, City Manager.

E. The insurance requirements of subsections A, B and C of this section shall be waived by the City Manager for nonathletic events if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The applicant or an officer of the sponsoring organization signs a verified statement that he believes the event’s purpose is the expression, dissemination or communication of opinions, views or ideas by verbal, visual, literary or auditory means and that he/she has determined that the cost of obtaining insurance is so financially burdensome that it would constitute an unreasonable burden on the right of such First Amendment expression, or that it has been impossible to obtain insurance coverage.

The statement shall identify the insurance agent licensed to do business in California who has investigated the costs of such insurance, or state that the applicant/sponsor has reviewed the insurance premium for the required coverage under a City-held special events insurance policy.

2. The City may, at its discretion, require the applicant/sponsor to apply for insurance coverage for the event under a policy selected by the City. The applicant/sponsor must provide any information pertinent to qualifying for the insurance coverage. The premium for the insurance coverage will be paid for by the City rather than the applicant/sponsor.

F. It will be the discretion of the City Manager to authorize insurance coverage in the amount less than specified under this section, upon determination that the special event is of such a nature as to present minimal or no risk to the City. [Ord. 1162 § 1(Exh. A), 2002.]

The applicant/sponsor of a special event involving the sale of food or beverages, erection of structures, horses or other large animals, or water aid stations will be required to provide a cleanup/damage deposit, as established by City fee schedule set by resolution of the City Council, prior to the issuance of the special event permit.

17.36.010 Definitions.
The term “sidewalk area” shall mean the area between a private property line and the street line, which area may include, without limitation, the sidewalk itself, a planting strip, and any curbing which is integral to the sidewalk, bulkheads, retaining walls or other works for the protection of any sidewalk or planting strip. For the purpose of this definition, “street line” shall mean the outer edge of the vehicle travel lane. As utilized herein the term “sidewalk area” shall not include dirt pathways over completely unimproved areas, or stairways consisting of more than two steps.

The term “owner” includes, without limitation, the fee owner(s) of real property, or their agent(s). [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.020 Duty of property owner to repair and maintain sidewalk.
As set forth in California Streets and Highways Code Section 5610, the owner of real property adjacent to or fronting on any portion of a sidewalk area shall repair and maintain such sidewalk area in a safe and nondangerous condition at the owner’s cost and expense. The owner shall have the primary and exclusive duty to perform such repair and maintenance, whether or not the City has notified the owner of the need for such repair or maintenance or has performed similar maintenance or repairs in the past. The duty to repair shall include the repair of damage caused by any force(s) including, without limitation, damaged caused by trees planted within the public right-of-way or adjacent private property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the owner believes that damage to the sidewalk area has been caused by a tree planted by the City, the owner shall so notify the City Engineer in writing and in the event that the City Engineer, or his designee, determines that all or a portion of the damage to the sidewalk area was caused by a tree planted by the City, the City shall repair the damage to the sidewalk area caused solely by the City planted tree; provided, however, that the City’s repair of such damage does not alter or affect the provisions of SMC 17.36.030.

Sidewalk areas with a vertical displacement greater than one-half inch between the edges of cracks and walks with rough nonuniform exposed aggregate surfaces are examples of walks that are considered out of compliance and in need of repair.

Maintenance and repair of sidewalk areas shall include, but not be limited to, maintenance and repair of surfaces including grinding, replacement of sidewalk, repair and maintenance of curbs and gutters which are an integral part of the sidewalk, removal of weeds and/or debris, tree root pruning and installing root barriers, trimming of shrubs and/or ground cover. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.030 Liability for injuries to public.
Any owner required by SMC 17.36.020 to repair and maintain any portion of a sidewalk area shall owe a duty to members of the general public, including travelers on the sidewalk area, to repair and maintain the sidewalk area in a safe and nondangerous condition. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any owner to fail to perform the duties and obligations established by SMC 17.36.020 or to perform such duties and obligations in a negligent manner. If any person suffers personal injury or damage to property as a result of the failure of any owner to maintain any sidewalk area in a safe and nondangerous condition as required by SMC 17.36.020, the owner shall be directly liable to such person for the resulting injury or damages. The City shall have a cause of action for indemnity against any owner for any damages, including without limitation attorneys’ fees, costs, any judgments, awards or settlement proceeds it may be required to pay as satisfaction of any judgment or settlement of any claim that results from injury to persons or property as a legal result of the failure of the owner to maintain the sidewalk area in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.040 Notice to repair sidewalk – Commencement date.
When, in the judgment of the City Engineer, any portion of any sidewalk area is so out of repair or is in such condition as to endanger persons or property passing thereon or as to interfere with the public convenience in the use thereof, the City Engineer is authorized to notify the owner in writing, to be delivered to such owner, requiring such owner to repair, reconstruct or improve forthwith, in such manner, with such material(s) and to the extent as the City Engineer may determine and direct, such that the sidewalk area is restored to a safe and nondangerous condition.

Within 30 days (or such other, longer time as may be directed by the City Engineer in connection with repairs to be undertaken by a contractor selected by the City in order to allow for scheduling of the items of repair/maintenance with such contractor) after such notice shall have been delivered to such owner, he or she shall cause to commence such repair, reconstruction or improvement as may have been determined by the City Engineer and directed in the notice, and shall diligently and without interruption prosecute the same to completion. The owner shall obtain such permits as may be required by the City, including, without limitation, an encroachment permit, prior to undertaking or causing the repair of the sidewalk area; provided, however, that the City Council hereby waives the encroachment permit fee in connection with the repair and maintenance of sidewalk areas. The City Council shall by separate resolution adopt a program for the implementation of the requirements of this chapter. The program adopted pursuant to such resolution and the notice sent by the City Engineer pursuant to this section shall include that: (A) the fee for any encroachment permit required in connection with the repair/maintenance of the sidewalk area will be waived; (B) plans for nonstructural sidewalk repair/maintenance will be provided by the City at no cost to the owner if required; (C) the owner may choose to utilize the contractor selected by the City to conduct the repair at a specified cost to the owner (if it is possible to determine that cost) or the owner may hire a contractor of their own choice – in either case the cost of the repair shall be the sole responsibility of the owner; and (D) that the City will perform an inspection as required to ensure that the repair/maintenance is done in accordance with City requirements at no expense to the owner. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.050 Notice – Method of giving.
Notice to repair may be given by delivering a written notice personally to the owner of the property adjacent to the sidewalk area or by mailing written notice, postage prepaid, to the owner thereof at his/her last known address as the same appears on the last equalized assessment rolls of the City or to the name and address of the person owning such property as shown in the records of the office of the City Clerk. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.060 Repairs – When performed by City.
If any owner refuses or neglects to make such repair, reconstruction or improvement when required and directed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, the City Engineer shall cause such repair, reconstruction or improvement to be made, and any and all costs necessarily expended by the City in making such repair, reconstruction or improvement shall be reimbursed to the City as described in SMC 17.36.100. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.070 Report – City Engineer to file.
Upon the completion of the repair, the City Engineer shall prepare a report specifying the repairs, reconstruction or improvements which have been made, the cost of the work, a description of the real property adjacent to the sidewalk area on which the work has been undertaken and the amount against each lot or parcel of land proposed to become an assessment to pay the cost of such work. Any such report may include repairs to any number of parcels of property, whether contiguous to each other or not. All such reports shall be compiled and filed with the City Council on an annual basis, allowing the Council enough time to approve the reports and forward any special assessment to the Marin County Assessor’s office prior to the date fixed by law for the delivery of the assessment book, as discussed in SMC 17.32.100. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.080 Report – Notice of hearing.
Upon the completion of the repair, the City Engineer shall cause notice of the cost of the repair to be given the owner (in the same manner specified in SMC 17.36.050 for the giving of notice to repair), which notice shall specify the date, time and place when the City Council will hear and pass upon the report by the City Engineer regarding the cost of the repair (if such date, time and place have been determined), together with any objections or protests, if any, which may be raised by any owner liable to pay the cost of such repair and any other interested persons. If, upon completion of the work, the date, time and place for the hearing have not yet been determined, the City shall send a second notice including such information at least 30 days prior to the hearing. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.090 Hearing – Protests – Confirmation of report.
Upon the date and time fixed for the hearing the City Council shall hear and pass upon the report of the City Engineer, together with any objections or protests which may be raised by any owners liable to pay for the repair work and any other interested persons. The City Council may waive all or a portion of the cost of the repair work upon finding that the property owner is prevented from removing the cause of the damage to the sidewalk area by applicable City regulations. Upon finding of financial hardship and upon the property owner’s agreement to cause a separate lien to be filed against the property in the amount of the repair costs, the City Council may determine that the repair costs shall not become an assessment and lien against the property as set forth in SMC 17.36.100(A). After which, by resolution, the report as submitted, revised, corrected or modified shall be confirmed. The City Council may adjourn the hearings from time to time. The decisions of the City Council on all protests and objections that may be made shall be final and conclusive. [Ord. 1168 § 1, 2003.]

17.36.100 Assessment of cost – Collection.
A. The cost of the repair may be assessed by the City Council against the parcel of property adjacent to the sidewalk area upon which such repair was made, and such cost so assessed, if not paid within 14 days after its confirmation by the City Council, shall constitute a special assessment against that parcel of property, and shall be a lien on the property for the amount thereof which lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest thereon are paid, or until it is discharged of record.

B. If the cost so assessed is not paid within 14 days, then the special assessment shall be delivered to the Marin County Assessor’s office (together with the Engineer’s report and the City Council’s resolution approving it), who shall enter the amount thereof on the County assessment book opposite the description of the particular property and the amount shall be collected together with all other taxes thereon against the property. The special assessment shall be delivered to the County Assessor’s office prior to the date fixed by law for the delivery of the assessment book to be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary City taxes are collected, and such special assessments shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency, as provided for ordinary municipal taxes.
