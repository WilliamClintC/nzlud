to humans, or any animal that otherwise presents an immediate danger to the public health and
safety. Such animals may be taken or impounded even though no citizen makes a complaint and
even though the officer issues no notice to appear. Impoundment shall be subject to the following:
The officer shall notify the owner of an animal, identifiable by a tag or other method, which is
impounded under this Chapter, by telephone or personal service. Failure to receive such
notice shall not prevent the City or its authorized agency from carrying out the provisions of
this Article.
Confinement Period.
Such animal shall be confined in the City approved animal shelter for a period of three (3)
days, such period of time beginning at 9:00 A.M. on the morning following the day of
impoundment. If the owner does not reclaim his or her animal during the three-day
period, or if the officer or animal shelter is unable to locate and notify the owner after
making a good faith effort to do so within the three-day period, then the animal shelter
may offer for adoption.
If the animal is not identifiable by a tag or other approved method, no notice is required
and such animal shall be confined for a period of three (3) days beginning at 9:00 A.M. of
the morning following its capture; after such time the animal shelter may offer for
adoption.
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding the above, any animal impounded as provided in Section 210.060
shall be held for a period of at least ten (10) days for the purpose of observing such
animal for symptoms of rabies disease; after such time the animal shelter may
dispose of the animal.
Notwithstanding the above, any animal that is determined by the Community Service
Officer to not be domesticated may be released immediately to an animal shelter for
disposition without observing the minimum period of confinement.
Any animal may be claimed by its owner upon the payment of an impoundment fee that is
equal to charges that would be incurred by the City from an animal care facility. Each animal
impoundment is a separate and subsequent impoundment regardless of animal ownership in
prior impoundments.
Case-by-case provisions can be addressed for care of animals other than domesticated dogs
or cats.

of confinement to another place without the consent of the officer.

The Municipal Judge shall order the impoundment, the muzzling in accordance with
Subsection (D) and/or the confinement of the animal accused of being in violation of this
Section in a manner and location that will ensure that it is no threat to persons or other
animals pending the outcome of the hearing. If such impoundment, muzzling or otherwise
safe confinement is not possible or if prior court orders to restrain such animal have gone
unheeded, the Municipal Judge may order the animal immediately destroyed.
Vicious Canines To Be Muzzled. It shall be the duty of every owner, keeper or harborer of any
canine in the City, which canine is vicious or has been known to bite, chase or run after any
person or animal in the streets, alleys or any public place in the City, to keep the same muzzled
with a good and sufficient wire or leather muzzle securely fastened so as to wholly prevent such
canine from biting any animal or person until such time as a determination has been made by the
court as to whether the canine is vicious or not. Any person owning, keeping or harboring any
canine within the City limits contrary to this Section shall be guilty of a violation of this Code.
Immediate Destruction. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the Community
Service Officer or any Law Enforcement Officer from taking whatever action is reasonably
necessary to protect himself/herself or members of the public from injury or danger, including
immediate destruction of any vicious animal without notice to the owner.
Release Of. If a complaint has been filed in the Municipal Court against the owner of an
impounded animal for a charge under this Section, the animal shall not be released except on the

to any penalties for violation of this Chapter. The Municipal Judge may, upon making a finding that
an animal is vicious or that it represents a clear and present danger to the citizens or to other
animals in the community, order the animal to be destroyed in a humane manner by the animal
shelter. Surrender of an animal by the owner thereof to the Community Service Officer does not
relieve or render the owner immune from the decision of the court nor to the fees and fines which
may result from a violation of this Section.
Confinement; Destruction; Removal By Judge. The Municipal Court Judge or Judge Pro Tern shall
have the authority to order any animal deemed to be dangerous or vicious to be confined,
destroyed or permanently removed from the corporate City limits.

affect the health, safety and general welfare of citizens of the City because they:

protrusions, insecure mounting on blocks, jacks or other supports;
Are a ready source of fire and explosion;
Encourage pilfering and theft;
Constitute a blighting influence upon the area in which they are located;
Constitute a fire hazard because they frequently block access for fire equipment to adjacent
buildings and structures.

1142 §2, 12-8-2004; Ord. No. 1459 § 2, 5-17-2017]
Planned Zoning Districts. The zoning of land in the City of Mission to one (1) of the planned zoning
districts shall be for the purpose of encouraging and requiring orderly development at a quality
level generally equal to or exceeding that commonly found in projects developed under
conventional zoning, but permitting deviations from the normal and established development
techniques. The use of planned zoning procedures is intended to encourage large-scale
developments, efficient development of small tracts, innovative and imaginative site planning,
conservation of natural resources and minimum waste of land. The following are specific
objectives of the planned zoning district.
Proposal to rezone land to a planned district shall be subject to the same criteria relative to
compliance with master plans, land use policies, neighborhood compatibility, adequacy of
streets and utilities and other elements as is normal in rezoning deliberations.
The submission by the developer and the approval by the City of development plans
represents a firm commitment by the developer that development will indeed follow the
approved plan in all aspects.
Residential areas will be planned and developed in a manner that will produce more useable
open space, better recreational opportunities, safer and more attractive neighborhoods than
under standard zoning and development techniques.
Commercial areas will be planned and developed so as to result in attractive, viable and safe
centers and clusters, as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares. Control of vehicular
access, architectural quality, landscaping and signs will be exercised to soften the impact on
nearby residential neighborhoods and to assure minimum adverse effects on the street
system and other services of the community.
The applicant will be given latitude in using innovative techniques in the development of land
not feasible under application of standard zoning requirements.
Planned zoning shall not be used as a refuge from the requirements of the equivalent district
as to intensity of land use, amount of open space or other established development criteria.
Any building or portion thereof may be owned in condominium under K.S.A. 58-3101.
For purposes of this Title, the term "shopping center," "office park," "industrial park" or other
grouping of buildings shall mean developments that were planned as an integral unit or
cluster on property under unified control or ownership at the time the zoning was approved by

The amount of signage, open space, buffer zone, yard, parking, play areas, density and height
requirements shall be determined by the City Council upon recommendation of the Planning
Commission after review of the proposed plan. The City Council and the Planning Commission
shall use the requirements and standards found in the corresponding district as detailed in these
regulations as a guide in making their determination but may permit deviations from these
requirements and standards in the interest of efficient land development and utilization. In
reviewing such development plan, the maximum height of buildings and structures within such
planned district shall generally be as set out in the corresponding district. It shall be permissible
that front, side and rear yards may be reduced to zero in appropriate circumstances.
The permitted uses shall be the same as those permitted in the equivalent district unless
otherwise altered as part of the development plan approved by the City Council for the specific
area to which each planned district applies. Alterations may include allowing additional uses that
the underlying district does not otherwise allow as well as prohibiting uses that the underlying
district otherwise allows. For example, the City Council may permit mixed residential uses or
mixed residential and commercial uses in accordance with the development plan for the planned
district.
The Planning Commission and/or City Council may require assurance of the financial and
administrative organization and ability of any agency created by a developer for the purpose of
maintaining common open space and facilities or amenities of a non-public nature.
The Planning Commission and City Council may in the process of approving preliminary and final
plans indicate that a portion of the parking area required under this Title may remain unimproved
until such time as the City Council deems it must be improved to serve parking demand
adequately.
Any deviation from the requirement in the equivalent district may be granted by the Planning
Commission and Council only where there is ample evidence that said deviation will not adversely
affect neighboring property, nor will it constitute the mere granting of a privilege.
The parking ratio for grouped commercial projects shall as a minimum follow the existing district
requirements. However, approval of a preliminary rezoning plan does not exempt the ultimate
tenant or tenants from following any higher requirement set forth in this Code for specific uses.
Reduction of setbacks or other open space shall be compensated by additional open space in
other appropriate portions of the project. In all cases such deviation shall be in keeping with good
land planning principles and must be specifically set out in the minutes of the Commission, as well
as on plans and other exhibits in the record.
The design of all planned projects, whether residential, commercial, industrial or mixed use, shall
be such that access and circulation by fire-fighting equipment is assured and may not be retarded
by steep grades, heavy landscaping or building space.
The Planning Commission or City Council may, in the process of approving preliminary plats, final
plats, preliminary development plans or final development plans, approve deviations from the
specific terms of this Title which would not be contrary to the public interest and where, owning to

and shall be operated in a sanitary, orderly and efficient manner and shall maintain a neat
appearance at all times. No damaged or deteriorated mobile home shall be permitted to remain;
and suitable and effective rules for regulating the outside storage of equipment, the removal of

Section 410.160. Statement of Intent.
[Ord. No. 1091 §§1 — 3(App. A §410.160), 9-24-2003; Ord. No. 1188 §2, 12-14-2005]
The zoning of property as "MS1" Main Street District 1 is intended to provide development
opportunities consistent with the existing character within the core of Downtown Mission. Downtown
Mission is the original commercial district within the City. The majority of buildings in the core of
downtown have been constructed to the public right-of-way. Public parking lots are available and onstreet
parking is present to serve the downtown businesses. The result is a character unique to
downtown that is not found elsewhere in the City. The "MS1" District provides for the majority of retail
uses, while encouraging an active streetscape with a pedestrian friendly shopping environment. This
district restricts automobile oriented uses and does not allow offices on the ground floor level. The
district is also intended to allow multi-story buildings with office and residential uses above the ground
floor level. Multi-story buildings with top-floor setbacks are encouraged within this district as described
in the Mission/Rock Creek Redevelopment Masterplan. In addition, the district is intended to allow
flexibility from the normal development standards found elsewhere in the City.

bistros, coffee houses, delis, bakeries, candy/ice cream/yogurt shops, ethnic foods (i.e. Italian,

dry cleaners and tailor shop; coin-operated laundry, locksmith service, pharmacy; physical fitness
facility; shoe repair/shine; video rental, computer services and other establishments of similar
character.

prescribed in Chapter 445, Article III, Section 445.180 et seq.

Article X. "MXD" Planned Mixed Use District
Section 410.410. Statement of Intent.
[Ord. No. 1188 §19, 12-14-2005]
The zoning of property to the "MXD", Planned Mixed Use District is intended to encourage a variety of
land uses in closer proximity to one another than would be possible with more conventional zoning
districts and to encourage building configurations that create a distinctive and memorable sense of
place. Developments in this district are allowed and expected to have a mixture of residential, office
and retail uses, along with public spaces, entertainment uses and other specialty facilities that are
compatible in both character and function. Developments are also expected to utilize shared parking
facilities linked to multiple buildings and uses by an attractive and logical pedestrian network that
places more emphasis on the quality of the pedestrian experience than is generally found in typical
suburban development. Buildings are intended to be primarily multi-story structures with differing uses
organized vertically rather than the horizontal separation of uses that commonly results from
conventional zoning districts. This planned zoning district is intended for those areas Master Planned
as office or commercial, or where a special study has been undertaken that recommends a nonresidential-
focused mixed use development. This district is not intended for areas Master Planned for
residential development or for mixed use developments that are residentially focused.
Section 410.420. Permitted Uses.
[Ord. No. 1188 §19, 12-14-2005]
No building, structure, land or premises shall be used, and no building or structure shall be
hereafter erected, constructed, moved or altered, except for one (1) or more of the following uses,
subject to the development and performance standards set forth in Section 410.450:
Any use permitted in District "MS2" subject to applicable development and performance

Article II. Screening and Fencing
Section 415.020. Purpose and Intent.
[Ord. No. 1007 §16-229.01, 1-24-2001; Ord. No. 1091 §§1 — 3(App. A §415.020), 9-24-2003]
It is the purpose and intent of this Article to improve the well-being of the community by the control of
fencing and the requiring of proper screening to enhance visual surroundings by screening out
unsightly views and conditions, to increase the quality of living by upgrading conditions within the City
of Mission, to protect the residential community by affording a level of privacy and at the same time
establishing better scale and controls to the business and commercial areas. It is desirable to
encourage combinations of elements of appropriate fencing, land berming and planting barriers and to
soften hard transition areas. It is equally desirable to maintain a high degree of traffic safety by proper
location of screening and fencing so that safety will remain paramount.

Screening and fencing is required at the following locations:
Where Districts "C-O" through "M-1" abut a residentially zoned district, not less than a six (6)
feet (6) high solid screen fence or wall will be erected along the abutting rear or side property
lines which are common to the property zoned for residential purposes, except that such
screening shall not extend in front of the building line or adjacent dwellings. In addition to the
fencing, sufficient landscaping, berming and plant material will afford a pleasing and softening
variety so that the view is equally pleasant from the non-residential side. Where an equal
fence exists on the abutting residential property, it will not be required on this property. Details
shall be included in the landscape or construction plans.
All multi-family residential projects and all commercial, office, industrial or special use projects
shall include on the site plan a detailed drawing of enclosure and screening method to be
used in connection with trash bins on the property. No trash bin shall be visible from off the
property and a permanent masonry or frame enclosure shall be provided and maintained for
each such bin.
In any district where a retaining wall is needed because of abrupt changes in the grade,
planting and fencing shall form a protective barrier to prevent loss or injury.
Around a swimming pool, whether private or public, shall be a protective fenced enclosure not
less than five (5) feet high including a locking gate which shall be locked at all times when the
facility is unattended.
Around and about hazardous areas, holes, new construction, etc., whether temporary or
permanently necessary to protect against intrusion, for control or to give a degree of privacy
or whatever reason, to protect the public from a hazardous situation.
Where it is deemed necessary as a solution to a problem by the Planning Commission or
Governing Body.
All roof-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened on all sides to the extent that such
equipment will not be seen from adjacent property or street at normal eye level. Such a
screen shall be of a material that harmonizes with the building.

Section 420.140. Continuation of Non-Conforming Situations and
Completion of Non-Conforming Projects.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Title and subject to the restrictions and qualifications
set forth in Sections 420.150 through 420.210, non-conforming situations that were otherwise
lawful on the effective date of this Article may be continued.
Non-conforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section
420.210.
The burden shall be on the landowner or developer to establish entitlement to continuation of nonconforming
situations or completion of non-conforming projects.
Section 420.150. Non-Conforming Lots.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
This Section applies only to undeveloped non-conforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no
substantial structures upon it. For purposes of this Section, a "substantial structure" shall include
any structure in excess of six hundred (600) square feet in floor area which was constructed for a
use which was a principal use permitted in the zoning district at the time of construction. A change
in use of a developed non-conforming lot may be accomplished only in accordance with Section
420.180.
When a non-conforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the
intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the applicable requirements to that zoning district,
then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use that requires
a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular district is permissible on a
non-conforming lot.
When the use proposed for a non-conforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but
the applicable setback requirements cannot be complied with, then the Board of Zoning Appeals
(in the case of a conventional zoning district) or the Planning Commission (in the case of a
planned zoning district) may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds
that:
Development of the property is not reasonably possible for the use proposed without such
deviations;

The deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the non-conforming lot; and
The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on
surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
For purposes of Subsection (C), development in compliance with the applicable building setback
requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use
proposed for the non-conforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in
conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute
grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
Subject to the following sentence, if, on the date this Article becomes effective, an undeveloped
non-conforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one (1) or more other undeveloped
lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the non-conforming lot nor his or her
successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this Section. This Subsection shall
not apply to a non-conforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the
street where such lot is located and within five hundred (500) feet of such lot are also nonconforming.
The intent of this Subsection is to require non-conforming lots to be combined with
other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not
to require such combination when that would be out of character with the neighborhood that has
previously been developed.
Section 420.160. Extension or Enlargement of Non-Conforming
Situations.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
Except as specifically provided in this Section, no person may engage in any activity that causes
an increase in the extent of non-conformity of a non-conforming situation. In particular, physical
alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity
results in:
An increase in the total amount of space or building area devoted to a non-conforming use; or
Greater non-conformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback
requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as
parking requirements.
Subject to Subsection (D), a non-conforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a
completed building that, when the use was made non-conforming by this Article, was manifestly
designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, except as otherwise provided in
Section 420.210, a non-conforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land
outside the original building.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 420.210, a non-conforming use of open land may not be
extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became non-conforming;
provided however, that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the land may be
expanded to other portions of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming
if ten percent (10%) or more of the earth products had already been removed on the
effective date of this Article and where the development and performance standards otherwise
applicable to such a use are complied with.
The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a non-conforming situation exists may
be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a non-conforming situation
exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of
activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this Section occur.

Notwithstanding Subsection (A), any structure used as a one-family dwelling and maintained as a
non-conforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long
as the enlargement or replacement does not create new non-conformities or increase the extent of
the existing non-conformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements.
This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in Section 420.200.
Section 420.170. Repair, Maintenance and Restoration.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of structures where non-conforming situations exist are
permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than fifty percent
(50%) of the fair market value of the structure to be renovated, shall not be permitted.
If a structure located on a lot where a non-conforming situation exists is damaged by fire,
explosion, act of God or the public enemy to an extent that the costs of repair or restoration would
not exceed fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value, then the damaged structure may be
repaired or restored only in accordance with a non-conforming situation permit issued by the
Public Works Director pursuant to this Section. This Subsection does not apply to structures used
for one-family dwellings, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a building permit just
as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided by Subsection (E) of Section 420.160, except as
otherwise provided in Chapter 460.
Any repairs, renovation or restoration of a structure pursuant to this Section which would require
the issuance of any permit shall also require the issuance of a non-conforming situation permit by
the Public Works Director. In support of the application for such permit, the applicant shall submit
such information as may be required to satisfy the Public Works Director that the cost of the
proposed repairs, renovation or restoration would not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the fair market
value of the structure.
For purposes of this Chapter:
The "cost" of renovation or repair or restoration shall mean the fair market value of the
materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair or restoration.
The "cost" of renovation or repair or restoration shall mean the total cost of all such intended
work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of this Chapter by doing such work
incrementally.
Section 420.180. Change in Use of Property Where A Non-
Conforming Situation Exists.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
A change in use of property (where a non-conforming situation exists) may not be made except in
accordance with Subsections (B) through (E) of this Section. However, this requirement shall not
apply if only a sign permit is needed.
If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the
property is located and all of the other requirements of this Title applicable to that use can be
complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as
permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot.
Once conformity with this Title is achieved, the property may not revert to its non-conforming
status.
1/15/2020 City of Mission, KS
https://ecode360.com/print/MI3487?guid=28588717,28332931,28332979,28333075,28333216,28333235,28333309,28333486,28333515,283335… 215/558

If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the
property is located, but all of the requirements of this Article applicable to that use cannot
reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible only if the Planning Commission
issues a non-conforming situation permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the
Planning Commission finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this Title, that
the intended change will not result in a violation of Section 420.160 and that all of the applicable
requirements of this Title will be complied with that are reasonably possible. Compliance with a
requirement of this Title is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without
adding additional land to the lot where the non-conforming situation is maintained or without
moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused
by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding
that compliance is not reasonably possible. Further, in no case may an applicant be given
permission pursuant to this Subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if
additional non-conformities would thereby be created.
In making a determination under Subsection (C), whenever:
There exists a lot with one (1) or more structures on it, and
A proposed change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed
for such lot, and
The parking or loading requirements that would be applicable as a result of the proposed
change cannot be satisfied on such lots because there is not sufficient area available on the
lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the proposed use shall not be
regarded by the Planning Commission as resulting in an impermissible extension or
enlargement of a non-conforming situation in violation of Section 420.160. However, if the
proposed use is approved, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable
parking and loading requirements than can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and
shall also be required to obtain off-site parking if parking requirements cannot be satisfied on
the lot with respect to which the site development permit is required and such off-site parking
is reasonably available. If such off-site parking is not reasonably available at the time the nonconforming
situation permit is granted, then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if
and when it does become reasonably available. This requirement shall be a continuing
condition of the non-conforming situation permit.
A non-conforming use of land for outdoor storage may not be continued.
Section 420.190. Non-Conforming Site Improvements.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
On lots with non-conforming site improvements, no additions to or repairs or renovations of any
structure or site improvement may be made without first either bringing the non-conforming site
improvements into complete conformity with the regulations applicable to the zoning district in
which the lot is located or obtaining a non-conforming situation permit pursuant to this Section.
Provided however, that this Section shall not apply to the following circumstances:
Repairs or restoration of a structure pursuant to Subsection (B) of Section 420.170; or
Minor repairs or renovation of a structure or site improvement.
For purposes of this Section, "minor repairs or renovation" shall mean repairs or renovation costs
which do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the structural value of a structure or site improvement.
When an addition to or repairs or renovation of any structure or site improvement is proposed on a
lot with a non-conforming site improvement(s), the Board of Zoning Appeals (in the case of a

conventional zoning district) or the Planning Commission (in the case of a planned zoning district)
may approve a non-conforming situation permit allowing such addition or repairs or renovation if it
finds that:
The non-conforming site improvement(s) is the only non-conforming situation pertaining to the
property.
Compliance with the site improvement requirements applicable to the zoning district in which
the property is located is not reasonably possible.
The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on
surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
For purposes of Subsection (C), mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding
that compliance with the site improvement requirements is not reasonably possible.
Section 420.200. Abandonment and Discontinuance of Non-
Conforming Situations.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
When a non-conforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty (180)
days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming
use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes.
If the principal activity on property where a non-conforming situation other than a non-conforming
use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty (180) days or
discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then the
property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting
use unless the Board of Zoning Appeals (in the case of a conventional zoning district) or
the Planning Commission (in the case of a planned zoning district) issues a permit to allow the
property to be used for this purpose without correcting the non-conforming situations. Such permit
may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that eliminating a particular non-conformity is
not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot
where the non-conforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial structure that is
on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify which non-conformities need not be
corrected.
For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a non-conforming situation is lost
pursuant to this Section, all of the buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are
generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one (1) apartment in a nonconforming
apartment building for one hundred eighty (180) days shall not result in a loss of the
right to rent the apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is
continuously maintained. But if a non-conforming use is maintained in conjunction with a
conforming use, discontinuance of a non-conforming use for the required period shall terminate
the right to maintain it thereafter.
When a structure or operation made non-conforming by this Article is vacant or discontinued on
the effective date of this Article, the one hundred eighty (180) day period for purposes of this
Section begins to run on the effective date of this Article.
Section 420.210. Completion of Non-Conforming Projects —
Vested Rights.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
1/15/2020 City of Mission, KS
https://ecode360.com/print/MI3487?guid=28588717,28332931,28332979,28333075,28333216,28333235,28333309,28333486,28333515,283335… 217/558

All non-conforming projects on which construction was begun at least one hundred eighty (180)
days before the effective date of this Article as well as all non-conforming projects that are at least
ten percent (10%) completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date
of this Article may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as those
permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired and a vested rights permit is
obtained from the Director of Public Works. If a development is designed to be completed in
stages, this Subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction.
Except as provided in Subsection (A), all work on any non-conforming projects shall cease on the
effective date of this Article and all permits previously issued for work on non-conforming projects
may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a vested rights permit issued in accordance with
this Section by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall approve such a permit
if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial
binding obligations or otherwise changed his or her position in some substantial way in reasonable
reliance on the development regulations as they existed before the effective date of this Article
and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete its project as proposed.
In considering whether these findings may be made, the Planning Commission shall be guided by
the following, as well as other relevant considerations:
All expenditures made to obtain, or pursuant to, a validly issued and unrevoked building, land
disturbance, site development or sign permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable
reliance on the development regulations that existed before the effective date of this Article.
Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (B)(1), no expenditures made more than one
hundred eighty (180) days before the effective date of this Article may be considered as
evidence of reasonable reliance on the development regulations that existed before the
effective date of this Article. An expenditure is made at the time a person incurs a binding
obligation to make that expenditure.
To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a person shall not be
considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a person shall not
be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential
development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new
classification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the
property.
To the extent that a non-conforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures
made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming
project, a person shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures.
An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant in dollar amount and in terms
of the total estimated cost of the proposed project and the ordinary business practices of the
developer.
A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed
change in the development regulations affecting the proposed development site could not be
attributed to such person.
Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the development
regulations affecting a development site, the Planning Commission may still find that such
person acted in good faith if such person did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate
attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance. For example, the Planning
Commission may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the
proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made, either there
was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was
not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and the
developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.

When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or
reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments or other discrete units, the developer
shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer
can make the showing required under Subsection (B). In addition to the matters and subject to the
guidelines set forth in Subdivisions (1) through (6) of Subsection (B), the permit-issuing authority
shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to
complete phases or segments of a non-conforming project, consider the following in addition to
other relevant factors:
Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute
conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying, architectural
or engineering work.
Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in phases not yet
completed.
Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in
such a manner or location or to such a scale, in anticipation of connection to or
interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases, that the investment in such utilities
or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are
constructed in conformity with existing regulations.
The Planning Commission shall not consider any application for a vested rights permit authorized
by Subsection (B) that is submitted more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of this Article.
The Planning Commission may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but in no case may
it extend the application deadline beyond one (1) year from the effective date of this Article.
The Planning Commission shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for
permits under this Section.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections (A) and (B) above, development rights for a singlefamily
residential development shall vest upon the recording of a plat of such land. If construction
is not commenced on such land within five (5) years of recording a plat, then the development
rights in the project shall expire.
Section 420.220. Non-Conforming Signs.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004; Ord. No. 1259 §1, 5-21-2008; Ord. No. 1456 § 14, 4-19-2017; Ord. No.
1480, 6-20-2018]
Subject to the provisions of this Section and Section 420.200, non-conforming signs that were
otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Article may be continued.
No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of non-conformity of a
non-conforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no non-conforming sign may
be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the non-conforming condition, nor may
illumination be added to any non-conforming sign.
A non-conforming sign may not be moved or replaced and the message may not be changed,
except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this Article, and except for "sign
maintenance" as defined in Section 430.020. In conducting "sign maintenance" to a nonconforming
sign, a new sign permit is required.
Non-conforming signs may be maintained and repaired so long as the cost of such work within
any twelve-month period does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of such sign.
No such work shall be done without the person proposing to do such work submitting information
reasonably required by the City to establish the cost of the work and the value of the sign.

If a non-conforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity,
accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being
offered, or conducted, that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed (including
support structure) by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located or other
person having control over such sign within thirty (30) days after such abandonment.
If a non-conforming billboard remains blank for a continuous period of one hundred eighty (180)
days, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within thirty (30) days after such
abandonment, be altered to comply with this Article or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the
property where the sign is located or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of
this Section a sign is "blank" if:
It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or
activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted; or
The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in part or whole; or
The advertising copy has been removed.
Section 420.230. Non-Conforming Utility Structures.
[Ord. No. 1142 §14, 12-8-2004]
Subject to the remaining restrictions of this Section, non-conforming utility structures that were in
existence on the effective date of this Article may be continued provided documentation outlining
the size and location of the structures has been provided by the City prior to May 1, 2006.
Subject to the other provisions of this Section, non-conforming utility structures may be
maintained, repaired or replaced. A non-conforming utility structure may be altered or replaced
with an alternate structure in the same location, provided the resulting structure does not increase
the size of the pre-existing structure by more than twenty percent (20%) in volume and, further
provided, that no new non-conforming situations are created.
Non-conforming utility structures may not be moved, except to bring the structure into complete
conformity with this Article.

For all buildings or structures hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered, offstreet
parking in the form of garages or areas made available exclusively for parking or
loading/unloading purposes shall be provided. Such parking spaces shall be located entirely on private
property with no portion except the necessary drives extending into any street or other public way.
Parking shall be provided in quantities stated in the various zoning district regulations except that
certain occupancies which may have unusual parking needs are separately listed below.

All parking lots and drives leading thereto, except those serving single-family and two-family
dwellings, shall have curbs and drainage facilities approved by the City Engineer. Where greater
setback requirements do not prevail, the back of the curb of a paved parking area shall not be
closer than six (6) feet to a property line, except that in a planned zoning district, the Planning

adversely affect adjacent property by a wall, a fence or screen planting or a combination to a
height that the Commission deems adequate.
A portion of the parking area required under this Title may remain unimproved until such time as
the City Council deems it must be improved to serve the parking demand adequately. Such
delayed improvement may be permitted only after the Planning Commission is satisfied that the
initial occupancy of the premises will be adequately served by the lesser number of spaces and
only after approval of a final development plan indicating clearly the location, pattern and
circulation to and from the delayed parking spaces. The land area so delineated for future parking
shall be brought to finished grade, be landscaped and shall not be used for building, storage,
loading or other purposes.
Handicapped. Parking spaces shall be not less than twelve (12) feet wide and located as close as
possible to ramps, walkways and entrances. Such spaces shall be identified by handicapped
signs. For the number of spaces required see the Building Code.

around a parking lot shall be set back from a street if such setback will prevent adverse effects
upon the appropriate use of adjacent property or will prevent a traffic hazard, but provided that
such setback need not be greater than the respective front or side yard requirements in that
district.

Churches, schools, libraries, community centers or other public/semi-public facilities shall be
allowed two (2) wall signs with not more than one (1) on a facade. No such sign shall have an
overall area exceeding thirty-two (32) square feet. In lieu of one (1) of the wall signs, one (1)
monument sign shall be permitted. Such monument sign shall be located on the premises and not
less than ten (10) feet from the street right-of-way and each sign face shall not exceed fifty (50)
square feet in area. The height of such sign shall not exceed six (6) feet above the average grade
or six (6) feet above the nearest adjacent street grade, whichever is greater; provided that for each
two (2) foot setback from the street right-of-way in excess of ten (10) feet, an additional foot may
be added to the height of the sign to a maximum of eight (8) feet. These institutions shall be
exempt from the requirement of payment of fees as indicated in Section 103.040(C).
One (1) construction site identification sign of good quality may be permitted during the
development of any project. Such sign may identify the project, the owner or developer, future
tenants, the architects, engineers, realtors, contractors and subcontractors involved, funding
sources and may contain related information, including, but not limited to, sale or leasing
information. Such sign shall not exceed six (6) feet in height or thirty-two (32) square feet per face
with a maximum of two (2) faces and shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from the street rightof-
way. All such signs shall be removed prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy,
temporary or final, for the last building in each phase of the project. Sign permits shall not be
required for such signs.
One (1) directional sign shall be permitted at each entrance to a building site, at key intersections
within the site and at each entrance to a drive-through facility. Ground-mounted signs shall not

not be required for such signs.
Substitution Of Messages. Subject to the land owner's consent, a non-commercial message of
any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message or any duly
permitted or allowed non-commercial message, provided that the sign or sign structure is legal
without consideration of message content. This substitution of message may be made without any
additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent
favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech or favoring of any particular noncommercial
message over any other non-commercial message. This provision does not create a
right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel or land use, nor does it affect the
requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted. This provision does
not allow for the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial
message.
Penalties. Violations of the provisions of this Section shall be a civil infraction and punishable by a
minimum fine of fifty dollars ($50.00) and up to five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each day of a
continued violation shall constitute a separate violation for the purposes of applying the penalty
provision of this Section.
Severability. Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this Chapter. If any
Section, Subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Chapter is held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that decision shall not affect the validity
of the remaining portions of this Chapter.

No sign may be located such that it substantially interferes with the view necessary for motorists to
proceed safely through intersections or to enter onto or exit from public or private streets or
driveways. No detached sign shall be located in the sight distance triangle on a corner lot.
No sign may be erected such that by its location, color, size or shape, it would tend to obstruct the
view of or be confused with traffic signals or other signs erected by governmental agencies.
All signs shall be of sound structural quality, be maintained in good repair and have a clean and
neat appearance. Land adjacent to such signs shall be kept free from debris, weeds and trash. If
signs are not being maintained as described and the City deems them a public hazard or
nuisance, such signs shall be ordered repaired or removed.
No part of any sign shall be located closer than ten (10) feet from any side or rear property line.
Time and/or temperature instruments may be permitted provided they are designed in harmony
with the building and are architecturally compatible.
The dimensions of a backlighted sign, canopy or panel shall be measured by constructing a
rectangle from the highest, lowest and widest points of such object, display or surface which
displays a light source, except that the opaque surfaces immediately related to or a part of that
same sign or panel shall also be calculated in the dimensions of the sign. Provided further, in
calculating the dimensions of a continuous panel which spans at least eighty percent (80%) of any
one (1) facade of a single or common structure with multiple tenants, the continuous opaque areas
between, over and below the lighted areas for such independent operations shall not be calculated
to determine the dimensions of the signs, canopies or panels.
The dimensions of a sign shall be measured by constructing a rectangle from the highest, lowest
and widest points of such object, display or surface.
Section 430.120. Private Sign Criteria.
[Ord. No. 1091 §§1 — 3(App. A §430.120), 9-24-2003; Ord. No. 1456 § 11, 4-19-2017]
All hotels and motor hotels and shopping centers, business parks, office parks, industrial parks and
"MXD" developments shall be required to prepare a set of sign criteria governing all exterior signs in
the development to assure harmony and visual quality throughout the development. As an alternative
to the specific sign requirements of any commercial or industrial district, the owner may seek approval
of an alternate set of sign criteria. Such criteria shall be binding upon all subsequent purchasers or
lessees within the development. The size, colors, materials, styles of lettering, appearance of logos,
types of illumination and location of signs shall be set out in such criteria. Final development plans
shall not be approved until the Planning Commission has approved the sign criteria. No sign permit
shall be issued for a sign that does not conform to the criteria. For purposes of this Section, the terms
"shopping centers, business parks, office parks, industrial parks, or "MXD" developments" shall mean
a project of one (1) or more buildings that has been planned as an integrated unit or cluster on
property under unified control or ownership at the time that zoning was approved by the City. The sale,
subdivision or other partition of the site after zoning approval does not exempt the project or portions
thereof from complying with these regulations relative to the number of detached signs, harmony and

Section 430.130. Signs Of Historic Significance.
[Ord. No. 1480, 6-20-2018]
Purpose. The signs of historic significance regulations are intended:
To provide for the preservation of the City of Mission's unique character, history, and identity,
as reflected in its historic and iconic signs;
To preserve the sense of place that existed within the central business district and in areas of
the City with concentrations of surviving historic signs;
To protect the community from inappropriate reuse of non-conforming and/or illegal signs
while ensuring that the signs are safe and well maintained;
To allow the owner the flexibility to preserve historic and vintage signs. This classification
does not preclude owners from removing these signs.
Criteria For Identification Of A Sign Of Historic Significance.
To qualify for an application for identification as an historic sign, the sign shall comply with the
following criteria:
The sign shall have been installed at least forty (40) years prior to the date of application;
The sign is structurally safe or can be made safe without substantially altering its
historical appearance;
The sign retains the majority of its character-defining features (materials, technologies,
structure, colors, shapes, symbols, text and/or art) that have historical significance, are
integral to the overall sign design, or convey historical or regional context; and
The sign exemplifies the cultural, economic, and historic heritage of the City.
In addition, the following criteria may also be considered in the application process:
The sign is an example of technology, craftsmanship or design of the period when it was
constructed;
The sign may, include, but is not limited to, a detached sign, pole sign, a roof sign, a
painted building sign, or a sign integral to the building's design (fascia sign) or any other
type of sign that was permitted on the property at the time the sign was installed; and
The sign is unique, was originally associated with a local business or local or regional
chain, or it is a surviving example of a once common sign type that is no longer common.
Process For Approval Of Signs Of Historic Significance.
Application for approval of signs of historic significance may be made by the property owner
having control over a sign or may be initiated by the City.
Within sixty (60) days of submittal of an application, the Planning Commission shall determine
if the application is complete and if the sign meets the applicable criteria for classification, and
shall notify the property owner, in writing, whether or not the sign is eligible for classification
as a sign of historic significance.

If the Planning Commission determines that the sign is not eligible for classification, the
property owner may appeal the decision to the City Council within thirty (30) days after such
determination.
Exemptions, Restoration, Reuse.
Signs classified as a sign of historic significance are exempt from the sign regulations
regarding type, height, area, and location as set forth in the City Code.
Signs of historic significance that are non-conforming as to type, size, height, or location are
exempt from the regulations governing non-conforming signs and abandoned signs. However,
changes to the sign may not increase the non-conformity unless a variance is granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
A sign of historic significance that will be adaptively reused must retain, repair, or restore the
majority of the character-defining features (e.g., materials, technologies, structure, colors,
shapes, symbols, text, and/or artwork) that have historical significance, or are integral to the
overall design of the sign, or convey historical or regional context.
Demolition Of A Sign Of Historic Significance. Classification as a sign of historic significance does
not prevent the owner from demolishing the sign.

The site planning process generally shall consist of two (2) distinct stages including both
preliminary development plan and final development plan approvals. Applications fully satisfying
all preliminary development plan and final development plan requirements and procedures of
these regulations may be submitted for simultaneous processing and consideration. The
preliminary development plan may show development options or parameters which shall be
further defined at the time of final development plan approval. The final development plan shall
serve as the detailed site plan for the development of the site. No building permit may be issued
without a site plan review as required by this Chapter.
After the effective date of this Title (October 21, 2009), no property which has a zoning district
classification which requires approval may be developed, redeveloped, altered, replaced or
repaired without a site plan first having been submitted to and approved by the Planning
Commission, City Council or the Community Development Director or his designee. New
development or redevelopment, regardless of whether a zoning change is necessary, shall require
both preliminary and final development plan approval. Existing structures or developments being
altered, replaced or repaired and that contain "significant changes" as set forth in Section
440.175(A)(5) shall require preliminary and final development plan approval. Existing structures or
developments being altered, replaced or repaired that do not contain "significant changes" may be
approved administratively by the Community Development Director or his designee regardless of
whether a site plan is on file.
Disapproval of a site plan by the Community Development Director or his designee may be
appealed to the Planning Commission. Disapproval of a site plan by the Planning Commission
may be appealed to the City Council which may override the Planning Commission's decision by a
two-thirds (2\3) majority vote. An appeal to the Planning Commission's decision may be filed by
either the property owner or the Community Development Department by filing a notice of appeal
with the City Clerk within ten (10) days following the Planning Commission's decision. The
decision of the City Council shall be final.
The site plan shall be approved if it is determined that the following criteria are satisfied:
The site is capable of accommodating the building(s), parking areas and drives with
appropriate open space.
The plan provides for safe and easy ingress, egress and internal traffic circulation.
The plan is consistent with good land planning and site engineering design principles.
An appropriate degree of harmony will prevail between the architectural quality of the
proposed building(s) and the surrounding neighborhood.
The plan represents an overall development pattern that is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and other adopted planning policies.
Right-of-way for any abutting thoroughfare has been dedicated pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 455.

plan. Changes in the revised preliminary development plan which are not significant may be
approved by the Planning Commission and disapproval of such changes by the Community
Development Director or his designee. Significant changes in the revised preliminary
development plan may only be approved after rehearing by the Planning Commission and
City Council, such rehearing shall be subject to the notice and protest provisions set forth in

Plans For Non-Residential Uses In Residential District.
Consideration of a preliminary development plan for non-residential uses in a residential
district requires a public hearing before the Planning Commission, with publication notice and
notice to surrounding property owners as required by Section 440.060 and Section 440.070
respectively.
Following the close of the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall determine the
appropriateness of the proposed preliminary development plan according to the following
criteria:
The capability of the site to accommodate the building, parking and drives with
appropriate open space and safe and easy ingress and egress.
An appropriate degree of harmony shall prevail between the architectural quality of the
proposed building and the surrounding neighborhood.
The appropriateness of the minimum dimensions and areas of lots and yards contained
in the applicable zoning district regulations may be considered and increased. The
Planning Commission may approve the application, disapprove the application or
approve the application subject to modifications being made. Unless the Planning
Commission's action is appealed by the applicant, the Planning Commission's decision
shall be final.
In the event of disapproval of a preliminary development plan by the Planning Commission,
the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the
City Clerk within ten (10) days of the Planning Commission's decision. On appeal, the City
Council may approve the proposed plan, disapprove the proposed plan or approve the
proposed plan subject to modifications being made.

No. 1304 §22, 10-21-2009]
Plans Required.
Final development plans which contain no modifications or additions from the approved
preliminary development plan shall be approved by the Planning Commission if the
Commission determines that the landscaping and screening plan is adequate and that all
other submission requirements have been satisfied.
A final development plan which contains modifications from the approved preliminary
development plan, but is in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, may be
approved by the Planning Commission without a public hearing, provided that the
Commission determines that the landscaping and screening plan is adequate and that all
other submission requirements have been satisfied. For purposes of this Section, lack of
"substantial compliance" shall have the same meaning as "significant changes" as set forth in
Section 440.175(A)(5).
In the event of a determination that the proposed final development plan is not in substantial
compliance with the approved preliminary development plan, the applicant must submit a
combined revised preliminary and final development plan.
In the event of disapproval of a final development plan by the Planning Commission, the
applicant may appeal such determination to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with
the City Clerk within thirty (30) days following the Planning Commission's decision. Upon
appeal, the City Council may reverse the decision of the Planning Commission if it determines
that the proposed final plan conforms to the approved preliminary plan and that all other
submission requirements have been satisfied.
Final development plans may be combined with the preliminary development plan provided
that all information required by both processes is submitted with the plan. Where a combined
preliminary and final development plan is submitted, it shall be considered in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 440.170 and 440.180.
Revisions to approved final development plans which do not include "significant changes" may be
approved administratively by the Community Development Director or his designee. Existing
structures or development being altered, replaced or repaired that do not contain "significant
changes" may be approved administratively by the Community Development Director or his
designee regardless of whether an approved site plan is on file.

Procedure For Revocation.
Revocation proceedings may be initiated by a majority vote of the Governing Body.
Unless the permittee and landowner agree in writing that the permit may be revoked, the
Governing Body shall hold a public hearing to consider the revocation of the special use
permit.
The City shall give the permittee and landowner notice of the scheduled revocation hearing at
least five (5) days prior to the date scheduled for such hearing. If the permittee and landowner
are present at the meeting of the Governing Body at which the revocation proceedings are
initiated, no further notice shall be required; otherwise, notice shall be given by personal
service or certified mail, return receipt requested. If the notice cannot be delivered or is not
accepted, notice may be given by publishing a notice of hearing in the official City newspaper
and by posting a notice of hearing on the property at least five (5) days prior to the date
scheduled for the hearing.
At the hearing, City staff shall present the evidence known to the City which may justify
revocation of the special use permit. Testimony may be presented by members of the City
staff, Planning Commission or Governing Body, or by such other witnesses as may be called.
Following the presentation of evidence, any person having relevant evidence may present
such evidence to the Governing Body. The permittee, landowner or their attorney may pose
questions to any person giving evidence under such conditions as may be imposed by the
Mayor or Presiding Officer. Following the presentation of evidence by the City and any other
persons, the permittee and landowner shall be entitled to present evidence or testimony of
witnesses. Members of the Governing Body and City staff shall be allowed to pose questions
to the permittee, landowner and any witnesses called on their behalf. Following the receipt of
their evidence, the public hearing shall be closed. After closing the public hearing, the
Governing Body may hear closing statements from the City staff and the permittee and
landowner or their attorney. The Governing Body may render its decision following such
closing statements or may take the matter under advisement.
No special use permit shall be revoked unless a majority of the Governing Body is satisfied by
a preponderance of the evidence that grounds for revocation exist. Any motion for the
revocation of a special use permit shall clearly state the grounds for revocation. In addition,
where the basis for revocation is "changed conditions" pursuant to Subsection (B)(4) of this
Section, revocation may only occur upon an explicit finding that revocation is necessary for
the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Adoption of any motion to revoke a
special use permit may be made subject to subsequent adoption of written findings of fact and
conclusions of law at the discretion of the Governing Body.
An appeal of any decision of the Governing Body to revoke a special use permit may be filed
in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. Any appeal taken shall not suspend the
order of revocation during the pendency of the appeal unless so ordered by the District Court.

been approved by the City Engineer. All street construction shall conform to the specifications of
Mission and compliance therewith, shall be confirmed by the City Engineer prior to release of
surety by the Governing Body.
In cases where a proposed subdivision abuts an existing or proposed collector street or
thoroughfare that does not contain a paved surface conforming to the standards established for
such streets, then the following standards and procedures shall apply:
If the street or roadway surface consists of hot mix asphaltic concrete pavement or overlay or
Portland cement concrete with a pavement depth of three (3) inches and minimum width of
twenty-four (24) feet, the subdivider need not make further surface improvements on that
street.
If the street or roadway consists of seal coated surface, crushed rock or material other than
asphaltic concrete; or if the surface is less than twenty-four (24) feet in width and three (3)
inches in depth or has an irregular deteriorated surface, then the subdivider shall improve the
length of such roadway through or along or abutting the entire subdivision as part of the
subdivision development process. Such improvement shall consist of not less than a three (3)
inch overlay of hot mix asphaltic concrete twenty-four (24) feet in width. Plans and
specifications for said pavement shall be approved by the City Engineer in the same manner
as other street construction in the City.
When a plat is approved and prior to recording, the applicant shall pay to the City sufficient
funds to pay one-half (½) the cost of construction of a thirty-six (36) foot wide collector street
or streets abutting the plat. The amount of such funds is to be estimated by the City Engineer
and is to be based upon the work involved.
The developer may deposit either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit on a reputable bank
payable to the City due one (1) year from the date of recording of the plat. Said cash or
irrevocable letter of credit shall be deposited with the Director of Finance for the City. The funds
collected from the developer or from the irrevocable letter of credit shall be placed in an escrow
account set aside for the improvement of said street or streets to the standards established for
such streets. The escrow account will be the only financial contribution paid by the developer or
his/her successors in interest for collector or thoroughfare streets serving the platted land and the
improvements will be made when scheduled on the City's capital improvement program or in any
event within ten (10) years from the time the cash is placed into escrow or within nine (9) years
from the cashing of the irrevocable letter of credit. In the event the improvements are not made
within the time stated above, the cash or funds from the escrow account, together with actual
accrued interest, will be returned to the developer or his/her successors in interest.

Chapter 460. Floodplain Management
Article I. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and
Purposes
Section 460.010. Statutory Authorization.
[Ord. No. 1054 Art. 1 §A, 9-11-2002; Ord. No. 1091 §§1 — 3(App. A §460.010), 9-24-2003; Ord. No.
1288, 2-27-2009]
Approval Of Draft Ordinance By Kansas Chief Engineer Prior To Adoption. The following
floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the Chief Engineer
of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on February 19,
2009.
Kansas Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et
seq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and general
welfare. Therefore, the City Council of Mission, Kansas, ordains as follows.
Section 460.020. Findings of Fact.
[Ord. No. 1054 Art. 1 §B, 9-11-2002; Ord. No. 1091 §§1 — 3(App. A §460.020), 9-24-2003; Ord. No.
1288, 2-27-2009]
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of Mission,
Kansas, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a
series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on

the particular streams subject to this Chapter. The base flood is the flood that is estimated to
have a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one (1) year as
delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS and illustrative materials dated
August 3, 2009, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory
flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that
would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
Section 460.030. Statement of Purpose.
[Ord. No. 1054 Art. 1 §C, 9-11-2002; Ord. No. 1091 §§1 — 3(App. A §460.030), 9-24-2003; Ord. No.
1288, 2-27-2009]
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Article I, Section 460.020(A); to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined
in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR
60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.

Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, providing Subsections (B) through
(F) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places or Local
Inventory of Historic Places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude
the structure's continued historic designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood
discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

or changed so as to require additional plan review or when the project involves deferred submittal
items, an additional plan review fee shall be charged.
Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of application shall
expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to
the applicant or destroyed by the Building Code Official. The Building Code Official may extend
the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days on written request by the

required inspection within 180 days of either the issuance of the permit, or from the date of
the last inspection.
Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so,
and the fee therefore shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such
work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and
specifications for such work; and provided further that the untimely progress has not
exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit that has expired for a period
exceeding one year, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. The Building Code

[Ord. No. 1378 §61, 3-20-2013]
For the purposes of the International Fire Code, 2012 Edition, as adopted, the following words and
phrases shall have the following meanings:
The term "chief" and "fire code official" shall in all instances mean the Building Code Official of

regulation, or law; or
The suppression or extinguishment of dangerous or hazardous materials; or
The investigation of the cause, origin, and circumstances of fire and unauthorized releases of
hazardous materials; in which instances the term shall mean Fire District Fire Chief.
In those instances where the fire-flow requirements and subdivision guidelines contained within
this code refer to a "hydrant", it is intended that the hydrant be supplied by a conventional water
source such as a water line, and that the hydrant be located in close proximity to the residence. If
water is available from a non-conventional source, such as a pond or stream, the Building Code
Official may make a determination that the non-conventional source provides substantially
equivalent fire-flow to the residence.
The term "isolated building site" shall mean any parcel of land which is not within a platted
subdivision of two or more lots or is located on at least ten acres. If the building site is the only lot
within a subdivision and on at least ten acres, then, for the purposes of fire-flow guidelines, such
site shall be considered an isolated building site.
The term "platted subdivision" shall mean division or re-subdivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land
into two or more resulting lots, tracts or parcels of land.
The term "access road" shall be defined as a road not less than 20 feet in width with not less than
13 feet 6 inches of unobstructed vertical clearance and built and maintained to support the
imposed loads to allow passage of fire apparatus in all weather conditions.
The term "approved or certified automatic sprinkler system", "approved or certified automatic fireextinguishing
system" or "approved or certified fire alarm and detection system" shall mean one
that has been designed by a fire protection engineer who is licensed in the State of Kansas, and
installed by a contractor licensed to do so by the Johnson County Contractors Licensing Program.
The term "alternate water source" shall mean a source for fire-flow derived from a river, lake,
canal, bay, stream, pond, well, cistern, or other similar source of water that is available as suction
supply for fire department use and meeting all requirements set forth by the Building Code Official.
These are guidelines which are intended to apply to most situations. Minor accommodations and
adjustments may be made by the Building Code Official on a case-by-case basis for good cause
shown so long as there is no significant increase in the potential for a fire hazard.

The purpose of this Act shall be to prevent the discharge of pollutants from land and activities
within the City into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and/or into surface waters.
The Governing Body of the City hereby finds that pollutants are discharged into surface waters,
both through inappropriate non-stormwater discharges into the MS4 or the surface waters directly
and through the washoff and transport of pollutants found on the land and built surfaces by
stormwater during rainfall events.
Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that such discharge of pollutants may lead to
increased risks of disease and harm to individuals, particularly children, who come into contact
with the water; may degrade the quality of such water for human uses, such as drinking, irrigation,
recreation and industry; and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers, streams, lakes and
wetlands leading to a decline in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals.
Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that this Article will promote public awareness
of the hazards involved in the improper discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste,
wastewater, oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste,
sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system.
Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that such discharges are inconsistent with the
provisions and goals of the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) and other Federal and State requirements for water quality and environmental
preservation.
Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that a reasonable establishment of
restrictions and regulations on activities within the City is necessary to eliminate or minimize such
discharges of pollutants, to protect the health and safety of citizens, to preserve economic and
ecological value of existing water resources within the City and within downstream communities
and to comply with the provisions of the City's responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and the
NPDES program.

In addition to the enforcement provisions of this regulation, the Director may issue a stop work
order if the Director determines that work authorized by a LD permit is in violation of this regulation
or the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan or if any one (1) or more of the following conditions
exist:
Inspection by the Director reveals the site defined by the LD permit is not in substantial
compliance with the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan as determined by the Director; or
Failure to comply with a written order from the Director to bring the site into compliance with
the LD permit, correct a violation of this regulation or restore a disturbed area within the time
limits defined by the Director; or
Failure to pay any required fee; or
Failure to submit reports in accordance with the design manual.
If a stop work order is issued by the Director, the Director shall order and direct the site owner or
the site owner's agent and any party in possession of the site, including the contractor performing
work at the site, to immediately suspend work.
A stop work order shall be in writing, shall state the conditions under which the work may be
resumed and may be served upon a person to whom it is directed by any reasonable method
including by personal delivery, by posting at the site or mailing a copy of the same to the address
identified within the LD permit application for the LD permit holder, site owner or any party in
possession of such property. If the Director issues a stop work order, all persons shall cease all
work on the site, except work necessary to remedy the cause of the stop work order as expressly
authorized by the Director.
It shall be a violation of this regulation for a person to undertake, allow, consent or permit another
to undertake work upon a site subject to a stop work order.
If the cause of a stop work order is not cured within a reasonable period, the LD permit may be
revoked by the Director and thereafter no person shall continue any work described in the LD
permit without first obtaining a new LD permit and paying a new LD permit fee as required by this
regulation.
Section 500.540. Effective Date.
[Ord. No. 1320 §1, 2-17-2010]
The provisions of this regulation shall be effective on upon their adoption by the City Council and
publication in the official City newspaper. A LD permit shall not be required for any land-disturbing
activities upon sites for which a valid City building permit, grading permit or right-of-way construction
permit has been issued prior to the effective date. Any final plat or final site plan approved prior to the
effective date shall nonetheless be subject to this regulation except for sites within such prior plat or
site plan for which a building permit, grading permit or right-of-way construction permit has been issued

Article XVIII. Post-Construction Stormwater Quality
Treatment Regulation
Section 500.550. Legislative Background.
[Ord. No. 1321 §1, 2-17-2010]
The Congress of the United States has amended the Clean Water Act of 1972 to reduce pollutants
discharged into the waters of the United States by extending National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) requirements regulating stormwater runoff discharge from construction and
development activities to the City. The City is subject to the NPDES requirements as an operator of a
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4), and the City is therefore obligated by Federal law to
develop, implement and enforce minimum "post-construction" stormwater quality treatment standards
in compliance with the City's Kansas Water Pollution Control General MS4 Permit.
Section 500.560. Purpose and Intent of This Regulation.
[Ord. No. 1321 §1, 2-17-2010]
The purpose of this regulation is to establish post-construction minimum stormwater quality
management requirements and controls on any new development or redevelopment projects that
disturb greater than or equal to one (1) acre of land. This regulation also establishes a
requirement for the long-term maintenance of stormwater quality facilities following construction to
protect the City's drainage system, streamways and water bodies. This regulation has the
following objectives:
Minimize increases in stormwater runoff rate and volume from development in order to reduce
pollution, sediment, erosion and maintain the integrity of the City's drainage system,
streamways and water bodies;
Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
developments which would otherwise degrade local water quality, particularly if receiving
water bodies are classified as impaired on the current version of the 303d listing of impaired
waters in Kansas as identified by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE);
and to
Reduce post-development stormwater runoff rates, erosion, sediment and non-point source
pollution to pre-development conditions, wherever possible, through the use of stormwater
best management practices, including stormwater facilities, and to ensure these best
management practices are properly maintained and pose no injury or threat to public safety.
Section 500.570. Definitions.

Section 500.670. Timing of Stormwater Facility Construction.
[Ord. No. 1321 §1, 2-17-2010]
The sequencing and protection of stormwater facilities during construction is an important design
consideration to ensure the facilities will perform as designed. The final SQMP shall include a
schedule of construction activities that indicates the point at which the stormwater facilities will be
constructed. In addition, the SQMP shall indicate the protection measures necessary to ensure
runoff from construction operations, which typically includes an increased amount of sediment, will
not adversely impact the design, operation or maintenance of the stormwater facility. If the
construction sequence is not known, the plan shall indicate the construction activities required to
be completed prior to construction of the stormwater facility, and it shall indicate the protection and
maintenance measures to be provided during construction activities to ensure proper stormwater
facility function following completion of construction activities. The following provisions are
allowable for timing of such facility construction:
For a stormwater facility serving a single building lot, the facility may be constructed
concurrently with the development of the site and building, subject to exceptions set forward
in Section 500.650 of this regulation.
Any stormwater facilities which include plantings or infiltration practices shall not be
constructed until ninety percent (90%) of the tributary watershed has been developed and
permanently stabilized unless the Director approves a different schedule. Additionally,
stormwater facilities must be installed and certified within six (6) months of permanent
stabilization of the entire land area served by the facility. "Land area served by the facility"
shall mean only those areas within the common plan of development and shall not include offsite
areas even if they are tributary to the facility.
For stormwater facilities serving multiple development lots within a common plan of
development, a building permit or certificate of occupancy may be withheld for any building or
site unless a permit has been issued authorizing construction of required stormwater facility to
serve the building or site.

agreement, the form of which shall be approved by the City Attorney, to ensure that the
stormwater facility, whether located on a separate, legally described lot or tract designated for
such stormwater facility, or upon a lot or tract that is also used for other purposes, can be
accessed, inspected, repaired and maintained by public officials if necessary. The easement or
agreement shall include provisions for access from public right-of-way to the stormwater facility by:
Landowners legally responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater facility, and
The Director for periodic inspection and, if necessary, maintenance of the stormwater facility.
All easements and agreements shall be appurtenant and permanent and shall contain a
provision that the terms and conditions of such easement or agreement shall not be changed,
or shall the easement or agreement be terminated without the consent of the City.
The stormwater easement or agreement shall also provide that if, after notice by the Director to
correct a situation or violation requiring maintenance work of the stormwater facility, satisfactory
corrections are not commenced by the landowner within a reasonable period not to exceed thirty
(30) calendar days, the City may perform all necessary work to place the stormwater facility in
proper working condition. The owners of the lands served by the stormwater facility, excluding any
public right-of-way, shall be assessed the cost of the work, including administrative costs,
materials, personnel, and any penalties. If work is performed by a third (3rd) party, the contracted
cost of the work, including reasonable administrative costs by the City, will be assessed. Costs
shall be apportioned to each owner based on a ratio of the area of land owned to the total area of
land assessed. This assessment may be accomplished by placing a special assessment on the
owners' property, placed on the owners' tax bill, and collected in the same manner as ad valorem
real estate taxes.
Section 500.700. Repairs During Maintenance Period.
[Ord. No. 1321 §1, 2-17-2010]
The principal under the performance and maintenance surety required by this resolution shall make all
needed repairs arising out of defective workmanship or materials which, in the judgment of the Director
or the certifying professional engineer, become necessary within three (3) years following the date of
completion and acceptance of a facility by the Director. If within twenty (20) calendar days after the
mailing of a written notice the principal under the performance and maintenance surety shall fail to
make or undertake with due diligence necessary repairs, the City shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to make necessary repairs at such principal's expense without first making any claim
against such surety; provided however, that in case of an emergency where, in the judgment of the
Director, delay in making repairs would cause a serious or significant loss, create a hazard, or cause
damage to others' property, such repairs may be made without prior notice being sent to such principal,
and such principal nonetheless shall be responsible for the costs incurred by the City in making such
repairs.
Section 500.710. On-Going Maintenance Responsibility.

provided to the Director along with a proposed schedule of completion for any necessary repair,
restoration or maintenance.
If the landowner shall fail to properly inspect, maintain, repair or restore any stormwater facility as
required by this regulation, the Director may undertake such inspection, maintenance, repair, and
restoration at the landowner's expense and all costs incurred by the City shall be collectable from
the landowner and shall constitute a lien against the landowner's real estate located in Mission,

allowable limit on the ground vibration, one (1.0) inches per second. The Building Code Official
may specify a more restrictive limit in the interest of the public safety or the Building Code Official
may approve a higher limit if the blaster can demonstrate that damage will not occur to buildings
or structures.
The maximum ground vibration shall not exceed the following limits at the location of any building.
Distance Maximum Allowable Scaled Peak
Distance (D) from the blasting
site in feet
Particle velocity (Vmax) for
ground vibration in
inches/second
Factor to be applied without
seismic monitoring

Ground vibration shall be measured as the particle velocity. Particle velocity shall be recorded in
three (3) mutually perpendicular directions. The maximum allowable peak particle velocity shall
apply to each of the three (3) measurements.
Applicable to the scaled-distance equation.
A seismographic record shall be provided for each blast at locations designated by the Building
Code Official. A blaster may use the scaled-distance equation, W=(D/Ds), to determine the
allowable charge weight of explosives to be detonated in any eight (8) millisecond period, without
seismic monitoring; where W=the maximum weight of explosives, in pounds; D=the distance, in
feet, from the blasting site to the nearest protected structure; and Ds=the scaled-distance factor,
which may initially be approved by a licensed engineer using the values for scaled-distance factor
listed. The blaster may use the ground-vibration limits in Figure 1 of this Section to determine the
maximum allowable ground vibration.
If the Figure 1 limits are used, a seismographic record including both particle velocity and
vibration-frequency levels shall be provided for each blast. The Building Code Official shall
approve the method for the analysis of the predominant frequency contained in the blasting
records before application of this alternative-blasting criterion. The Building Code Official can
reduce the maximum allowable ground vibration beyond the limits otherwise provided for in this
Section, if determined necessary to provide damage protection.
The blaster shall conduct seismic monitoring of all blasts at locations approved by the Building
Code Official.

Section 510.100. Removal of Unsafe Structures — Salvage, Sale
— Assessment and Collection of Costs — Procedure.
[Code 1983; CC 2000 §8-1A10]
If the owner of any structure has failed to commence the repair or removal of such structure within
the time stated in the resolution or has failed to diligently prosecute the same thereafter, the City
may proceed to raze and remove such structure, make the premises safe and secure, or let the
same to contract. The City shall keep an account of the cost of such work and may sell the

cost of removing such structure and making the premises safe and secure. All monies in excess of
that necessary to pay such costs and the cost of publications of notice and any postage for mailing
of notice, after the payment of all costs, shall be paid to the owner of the premises upon which the
structure was located.
The City shall give notice to the owner of such structure by registered mail of the total cost
incurred by the City in removing such structure and making the premises safe and secure and the
cost of providing notice. Such notice also shall state that payment of such cost is due and payable
within thirty (30) days following receipt of such notice. If the cost is not paid within the thirty (30)

from the proceeds of any insurance policy in which the City has created a lien pursuant to K.S.A.
40-3901 et seq., and amendments thereto, are insufficient to pay the cost of such work, the
balance shall be collected in the manner provided by K.S.A. 12-1, 12-115, and amendments

the structure was located and the City Clerk at the time of certifying other City taxes shall certify
the unpaid portion of the costs and the County Clerk shall extend the same on the tax rolls of the
County against such lot or parcel of land. The City may pursue collection both by levying a special
assessment and in the manner provided by K.S.A. 12-1, 12-115, and amendments thereto, but
only until the full cost and any applicable interest has been paid in full.

proceeds of any insurance policy in which the City has created a lien pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3901
et seq., and amendments thereto, are insufficient to pay the costs of the work and the cost of
providing notice, such costs or any portion thereof in excess of that received from the sale of
salvage or any insurance proceeds may be financed, until the costs are paid, out of the general
fund or by the issuance of no-fund warrants. Whenever no-fund warrants are issued under the
authority of this act, the Governing Body shall make a tax levy at the first (1st) tax levying period
for the purpose of paying such warrants and the interest thereon. All such tax levies shall be in
addition to all other levies authorized or limited by law and shall not be subject to the aggregate
tax levy prescribed in Article 19 of Chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
amendments thereto. Such warrants shall be issued, registered, redeemed and bear interest in
the manner and in the form prescribed by K.S.A. 79-2940, and amendments thereto, except they
shall not bear the notation required by that Section and may be issued without the approval of the
State Board of Tax Appeals. All monies received from special assessments levied under the
provisions of this Section or from an action under K.S.A. 12-1, 12-115, and amendments thereto,
when and if paid, shall be placed in the general fund of the City.

Whenever a petition is filed with the public officer by at least five (5) residents of the municipality
charging that any structure is unfit for human use or habitation or whenever it appears to the
public officer, on his/her own motion, that any structure is unfit for human use or habitation, he/she
shall, if his/her preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be
served upon the owner, every mortgagee of record and all parties in interest in such structure
(including persons in possession) a complaint stating the charges in that respect. Such complaint
shall contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the public officer or his/her designated
agent at a place therein fixed not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the

consideration is unfit for human use or habitation, he/she shall state in writing his/her findings of
facts in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner
thereof an order which:
If the repair, alteration or improvement of the structure can be made at a reasonable cost in
relation to the value of the structure, which shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the fair
market value of such structure, the owner of the property shall within the time specified in the
order repair, alter or improve such structure to render it fit for human use or habitation or shall

If the repair, alteration or improvement of the structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost
in relation to the value of the structure, that is to say, under fifty percent (50%) of such fair
market value, which is hereby deemed to be a reasonable cost by the Governing Body, the
owner shall within the time specified in the order remove or demolish such structure.
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close the
structure within thirty (30) days from the date of such order, the public officer shall file with the

Each service provider shall, prior to the earlier of commencement of construction or
commencement of service, present to the City the name, address, telephone number and fax
number of a person familiar with the facilities who is responsible for satisfying the information
needs of the City and other users of the right-of-way on forms issued by the City Clerk.
Prior to construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or relocation of any facilities owned by
the service provider, the service provider shall first obtain the necessary right-of-way permit from
the Public Works Director pursuant to Article II of this Chapter 520.
Prior to providing service to the City and its residents or installing facilities, the service provider
shall first obtain the necessary franchise agreement from the City.

horizontally and vertically, of all facilities of the service provider within the City as provided
hereafter.
The service provider shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of its facilities or any
portion thereof or any right, title or interest in the same, or the transfer of any rights under this
license to any person either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or
otherwise, without prior approval of the City provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the City that the proposed licensee
lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to perform its obligations under the license. Any
attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose the license or its system not
conforming with the requirements of this Section shall be null and void. This provision shall not
apply to sale of property or equipment in the normal course of business. No consent from the City
shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or
in part, to secure an indebtedness or for a pro forma transfer to a corporation, partnership or other
entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the licensee. Any violation of this
Section shall enable the City to revoke or modify the license.
Section 520.060. Right-Of-Way Occupancy Fee.
[Ord. No. 1006 §6, 11-22-2000]

Section 520.070. Use of The Right-Of-Way.
[Ord. No. 1006 §7, 11-22-2000; Ord. No. 1306 §1, 10-21-2009]
The service provider's use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City's use
or occupation of the right-of-way. Without limitation of its rights, the City expressly reserves the
right to exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the City.
The service provider shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner which minimizes
adverse impact on any public improvement, as reasonably determined by the City. Where
placement is not regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public
improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public improvement as defined in the
City's Manual of Infrastructure Standards available in the office of the Public Works Director.
Pursuant to Article II of this Chapter, the service provider's facilities shall be located underground
and shall comply with all ordinances of the City relating to underground service, unless such
requirement is waived by the City.

All facilities shall be located and laid so as not to obstruct or interfere with any public or private
water pipes, drains, sewers or other structures or public improvements already installed. In
addition, the service provider shall, in doing work in connection with its said facilities, avoid, so far
as may be practicable, obstructing or interfering with the lawful use of the streets, alleys, avenues,
roads, easements or other public places of the City.
All facilities of the service provider shall be placed so that they do not interfere with the use of
right-of-way and public places by the City. The City, through its Public Works Director, shall have
the right to consult and review the location, design and nature of the facility prior to its being
installed. The City shall limit its review to matters pertaining to public safety and aesthetics and to
what extent adjoining property will be adversely affected.
The service provider shall keep and maintain and provide to the City accurate records and as-built
drawings depicting accurate horizontal and vertical location of all its facilities constructed,
reconstructed, relocated or abandoned in the right-of-way. Such information shall be provided to
the City in the form of a route map and as-built drawings of existing or constructed facilities,
electronically in an AutoCAD format compatible with the City's Geographical Information Systems
(GIS) and Johnson County Automated Integrated Mapping Systems (AIMS) showing and
describing the exact locations, both horizontal and vertical, of all facilities constructed and existing.
Underground facilities shall be differentiated from overhead facilities.
The service provider shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable
measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature
and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the right-of-way or private
easements, both underground and overhead, when requested by the City or its authorized agent
for a public project. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the service
provider without any expense to the City, its employees, agents or authorized contractors. The
service provider shall designate and maintain a local affiliate familiar with the facilities, who is
responsible for satisfying information needs of the City and other users of the right-of-ways.
The ROW user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in the right-of-way
as directed by the City for a public improvement or when reasonably required by the City by
reason of public health, safety and welfare. Such removal, relocation or adjustment shall be
performed by the ROW user at the ROW user's sole expense without expense to the City, its
employees, agents or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations
and schedules of the City pertaining to such. The ROW user shall proceed with relocations at due
diligence upon notice by the City to begin relocation.
The ROW user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in private easement
as directed by the City for a public improvement at City expense by moving such facilities to areas
within the expanded right-of-way or within remaining private easements or remaining portions of
such easements not condemned by nor disclaimed to the City to avoid conflict with the City
construction and improvements. The ROW user shall disclaim those parts of its easements which
lie within the expanded right-of-way, the cost of any such future relocation shall be borne by the
City.
All newly constructed facilities shall be located underground and the ROW user shall comply with
all requirements of the City relating to underground facilities. Exceptions to this rule are:
When otherwise specifically provided for in the City Code or Zoning Regulations;
When such requirement is waived by the Planning Commission as part of a development
plan; or
When the Governing Body grants a special exception to this requirement on a temporary or
permanent basis on such terms deemed appropriate in case of emergency, safety concerns,
unusual circumstances or some other good cause.
In addition, in cases where temporary electrical power of communication service is

reasonably required for emergencies or for building construction purposes, the City
Administrator or his agent may grant special permission for the temporary construction
and use of poles, wires and other above ground facilities for a period not to exceed one
hundred twenty (120) days; provided, in the event that resolving said emergency or
completing said construction cannot be concluded within said time period because of a
shortage of material, a natural disaster, strikes or other circumstances beyond the
control of the parties, or by unusual hardships, then the time may be extended to an
additional temporary period or periods necessary to allow completion of such
construction. When above ground facilities are allowed pursuant to this Section, said
facilities shall be located only as directed by the City including, but not limited to,
requirements regarding location and height.
It shall be the responsibility of the service provider to take adequate measures to protect and
defend its facilities in the right-of-way from harm and damage. The City shall not be liable for any
damage to or loss of any of the service provider's facilities within the right-of-way or private
easement as a result of or in connection with any construction, excavation, grading, filling or work
of any kind, including public project or public improvement by or on the behalf of the City, provided
such damage is not directly or proximately caused by the willful, intentional or malicious acts of the
City. The service provider shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives and
authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay of any kind arising out of
the failure of the service provider to perform any of its obligations under this Article unless the
damaged party is solely responsible for the harm or damage by its negligence or intentionally
caused harm. The City or its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable
precautionary measures including calling for facility locations.
The Public Works Director may grant permission to the service provider to trim trees upon and
overhanging right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with
the facilities of the service provider upon review and approval of a plan and details for trimming
trees in the rights-of-way.
All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use,
maintenance, and dismantling of service provider's facilities in the right-of-way shall be in
accordance with applicable Federal, State and local law and regulations, including those
promulgated by national trade associations commonly associated with the service provided by the
service provider. It is understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum
standards and the requirements established or referenced in this Article may be in addition to or
stricter than such minimum standards.
Joint Installation Notification.
Prior to constructing any new or additional underground conduit or above ground boxes or
pedestals within the rights-of-way, a franchisee shall certify in writing to the City Engineer that
it has made appropriate inquiry to all existing utilities and other entities possessing a right to
occupy the rights-of-way as to the availability of existing or planned conduit or box or pedestal
locations that the franchisee could reasonably utilize to meet its needs, and that no such
conduit or box or pedestal locations are available or planned within the next six (6) months.
All existing utilities, and entities granted a Franchise, with usable conduit within the rights-ofway
shall make such conduit available to other franchisees consistent with the Federal
requirements of Section 47 U.S.C. 224. All existing utilities and entities granted a Franchise
with box and pedestal locations shall, when feasible, accommodate collocation of facilities of
other franchisees. Each franchisee shall provide mapping of all existing facilities and excess
conduit except as may be waived by the City Engineer as unnecessary or unduly
burdensome. All new facilities shall require sufficient mapping in hard copy and electronic
format.
Once the City Engineer has made the determination that no such conduit or box or pedestal
locations are available and has reviewed the plans and provided preliminary approval of the

location of the facilities, the licensee (franchisee) must notify by registered mail all companies
on file with the City prior to being authorized to proceed with installation of new conduit or
boxes and pedestals (or overhead facilities if otherwise permitted).
The franchisee shall comply with the following notification requirements:
The franchisee shall provide written notification by restricted mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, of the proposed construction activity and locations (whether by
trenching, boring, overhead installation or otherwise) to all other existing and potential
users of the rights-of-way as designated on a provider list approved by the City. The
notice shall invite all other firms to join with the franchisee in placing their own conduit
and laterals and boxes and pedestals in the noticed locations on a cost-shared basis.
The written notification shall contain sufficient mapping and information as would be
reasonably necessary for potential users to assess the viability of joint installation. The
notice shall include a statement that the notification is pursuant to this policy and shall
include a copy of this policy. Such notices shall disclose where the licensee (franchisee)
intends to construct conduit and contain a clear map of the proposed route or locations,
including all proposed lateral or connecting conduit to specific locations.
All companies notified shall have twenty-one (21) calendar days from the receipt of such
notification to indicate in writing to the City and the franchisee as to whether they desire
to jointly undertake the construction of such conduit or otherwise co-locate their facilities
at such time. Any company electing to jointly construct or co-locate its facilities with that
of franchisee shall share in the pro rata costs of such construction or joint installation of
facilities. All interested companies shall enter into a participant agreement and shall
designate a lead company, normally the licensee. The City shall be given a copy of the
participant agreement and will work with the lead company in making all construction and
location determinations, in granting permits, in making inspections, and in all other
matters with regard to the construction of the joint underground facility. All City policies,
requirements, construction standards and ordinances will apply to the project. The lead
company shall be responsible for maintenance and management of the joint facility. All
such issues and requirements shall be covered in the participant agreement.
A company that is invited to participate in a joint construction project and decides not to
participate may not enter the right-of-way for the purpose of the construction of new facilities
for a period of five (5) years from the date of receipt of notification. This prohibition does not
apply to the repair of existing facilities or situations determined by the City Engineer to be in
the nature of an emergency, or where good cause is determined by the City Engineer
justifying a failure by the company to respond and warranting new disturbance contrary to
timeframe established by this provision.
The City Engineer may limit the number of conduit that may be installed by each provider to
ensure that no one (1) provider unreasonably consumes a disproportionate amount of the
available rights-of-way. Unless space considerations otherwise dictate, each location shall be
presumed to be capable of permitting each provider to install up to two (2) four (4) inch
conduits or their equivalent.
Excess Conduit Requirements.
Policy objectives. The City has determined that the influx of users of the rights-of-way
requires affirmative action by the City to coordinate the users of the rights-of-way and to
ensure that there are sufficient underground facilities for future and existing communications
users. By requiring initial installers of facilities to install additional conduit for use by other
providers and the City, the City desires to promote competition by available infrastructure,
maximize the useable space in the rights-of-way, lower cost to the industry as a whole,
reduce excavations, and most importantly maximize safety by reducing the potential for
excavation accidents.

When a franchisee installs any new conduit, the franchisee shall at the request of the City
Engineer install sufficient additional conduit or other related facilities ("excess conduit") to
meet the City's planned infrastructure needs for the City and the expected needs of other
users of the rights-of-way. Such additional excess conduit shall be required as provided for on
a designated conduit plan, if any, and additionally as determined based on the following
criteria:
All construction of underground conduit will require the construction of additional conduit.
Excess conduit shall not be required for uses that are not technically compatible or in
locations or circumstances where the policy objectives stated in this policy would not be
served.
The City will normally require no more than one (1) four (4) inch conduit as excess conduit
unless the City Engineer determines by an independent review or industry study that more
than one (1) four (4) inch conduit is required to accommodate projected future rights-of-way
use.
The additional conduit will be constructed and managed by licensee (franchisee) or if this is a
joint construction project by the lead company. The additional conduit will be owned by the
licensee (franchisee), or in the case of joint construction the lead company, and will be sold or
leased to a licensee or franchisee wanting to locate facilities in the right-of-way. The owner of
the additional conduit will not unreasonably withhold such conduit or unreasonably price such
conduit. An unreasonable price is one that substantially exceeds the pro rata share of
constructing and financing the underground facilities or exceeds the cost of newly
constructing such conduit. The City reserves the right to review each situation and refer
potential users of the additional conduit to the owner. The owner of the conduit is obligated to
maintain the additional conduit in good and serviceable condition and will notify the City of
any inquiry regarding its possible use.
The cost of the additional conduit will be born by the licensee or, in the case of a joint
construction project, by all participants in the project on a pro rata basis. The licensee, or in
the case of a joint construction project all participants, shall recoup their pro rata share of
costs and financing through the sale of additional conduit.
All of the terms and requirements for installation and maintenance shall be set out in advance
of construction and agreed to by all parties. The City Engineer may adopt approved
agreements, require mediation, or may adopt other procedures or regulations to effect this
policy and to otherwise ensure the timely coordination of parties as to the joint installation and
or excess conduit.
Box And Pedestal Construction.
Policy objectives. The City has determined that the influx of users of the rights-of-way
requires affirmative action by the City to coordinate the users of the rights-of-way and to
ensure that there are sufficient acceptable box and pedestal locations for future and existing
communications users. By requiring initial installers of facilities to accommodate the use by
other providers, the City desires to promote competition by facilitating interconnections and
minimize the disruption to the rights-of-way and visual blight to the community.
When a franchisee installs any new boxes or pedestals, the franchisee shall provide to the
City engineer the locations and descriptions of all such proposed facilities and at the request
of the City Engineer shall install sufficient additional capacity or other related facilities to meet
the expected needs of other users of the rights-of-way.
The service provider may permit and has authority to allow a third party, including the service
provider's subsidiary or affiliate, to occupy or acquire rights to occupy the right-of-way or private
easement under this Article, provided however, the third party registers and obtains the proper

license from the City. The service provider shall notify the City of the intended third party use.
Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the service provider from providing to any third party the
use of the service provider's facilities in the rights-of-way.
In case of failure on the part of the service provider to comply with any of the provisions of this
Article or applicable law, or should service provider do or cause to be done any act or thing
prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Article, the service provider shall forfeit all rights
and privileges granted under this Article and all rights shall cease, terminate and become null and
void, provided that such forfeiture shall not take effect until the City shall provide due process to
the service provider.
The Public Works Director shall assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular
segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is or, pursuant to current
technology, the Public Works Director expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All
right-of-way permits issued by the Public Works Director shall indicate the proper corridor for the
service provider's work. Any service provider whose facilities are in the right-of-way in a position at
variance with the designated corridors shall, no later than at the time of next reconstruction or
excavation of the area where its facilities are located, move the facilities to its assigned position
within the right-of-way, unless this agreement is waived by the Public Works Director for good
cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities,
public safety, user service needs and hardship to the service provider.
Section 520.080. Abandoned and Unusable Facilities.
[Ord. No. 1006 §8, 11-22-2000]
A service provider who has determined to discontinue its operations in the City must either:
Provide information satisfactory to the City Clerk that the service provider's obligations for its
facilities in the right-of-way have been lawfully assumed by another service provider, or
Submit to the City Clerk a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities
to the City. If a service provider proceeds under this Section, the City may, at its option
purchase the equipment, require the service provider, at its own expense, to remove it, or
require the service provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for
reasonable anticipated costs to be incurred to remove the facilities.
Facilities of a service provider who fails to comply with this Section, and which facilities for two (2)
years remains unused, shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be
a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity including, but
not limited to:
Abating the nuisance;
Taking possession of the facility and restoring it to a useable function; or
Requiring the removal of the facility by the service provider.
Section 520.090. Severability.
[Ord. No. 1006 §9, 11-22-2000]
If any Section, Subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Chapter is for any reason held
invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions thereof.

In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the City by this Article, the City reserves to itself
every right and power which is required to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance under any
license granted under this Article. The City shall have the right to waive any provision of this

and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the right-of-way, to protect the property and safety
of the other users of the right-of-way, and to minimize the obstruction and inconvenience to the
traveling public.
When a right-of-way permit is requested for purposes of installing additional facilities and the
posting of a restoration bond for the additional facilities is insufficient, the posting of an additional

Section 520.230. Right-Of-Way Repair and Restoration.
[Ord. No. 1002 §11, 8-9-2000]
The work to be done under the right-of-way permit and the repair and restoration of the right-ofway
as required herein must be completed within the dates specified in the permit. However, in the
event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was
prohibited by unseasonable or unreasonable conditions, the Public Works Director may increase
the dates for completion of the project by as many days as work was delayed.
All backfilling and restoration work will be conducted in accordance with the APWA specifications.
In addition to repairing its own work, the permittee must restore any area within ten (10) feet of the
new excavation that has previously been excavated, including the paving and its aggregate
foundations. The permittee must also inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to
maintain the same condition for a period of thirty-six (36) months following the acceptance by the
Public Works Director of the original restoration.
The permittee shall repair its own work at no expense to the City or any of the City's agents,
representatives or authorized contractors.
The permittee shall perform repairs and restoration according to standards and with the material
specified by the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director shall have the authority to
prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so in written procedures of general
application or on a case-by-case basis. In exercising this authority, the Public Works Director shall
be guided by the following standards and considerations:
The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, obstructions or damage to the rightof-
way;
The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way;
The character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way;
The remaining life expectancy of the right-of-way affected;
Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would
otherwise result from the excavation, obstruction or damage to the right-of-way; and
The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the
depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place.
During the thirty-six (36) months following the acceptance by the Public Works Director of the
original restoration, the permittee shall, upon request from the Public Works Director, correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary, using any method as required by the Public Works
Director. Said work shall be completed within five (5) days of the receipt of notice from the Public
Works Director (not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable).
The thirty-six (36) month guarantee period shall only be applicable to the pavement surface. The
permittee shall be responsible in perpetuity to repair any failure of the excavation below the
pavement surface.

event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing, the costs associated with
restoration of the right-of-way plus a sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00).
Payment of a degradation cost shall not relieve the permittee of the obligation to complete the
necessary right-of-way restoration.
The Public Works Director shall have the authority to extend the guarantee period for an additional
thirty-six (36) months from the date of the new restoration if the Public Works Director determines
any overt action by the permittee not to comply with the conditions of the right-of-way permit and
any restoration requirements.
Section 520.240. Protective Measures.
[Ord. No. 1002 §12, 8-9-2000]
The permittee responsible for the excavation and who leaves any debris in the right-of-way shall
be responsible for providing safety protection in accordance with the latest edition of the Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
If an excavation cannot be backfilled immediately, the permittee shall request approval of the
Public Works Director to secure and adequately cover the unfilled excavation with a steel plate if
in the roadway or by timbers and plywood if not in the roadway.

Section 520.270. Supplementary Applications.
[Ord. No. 1002 §15, 8-9-2000]

after the end date. If a permittee does not complete the work by the permit end date, the permittee
must apply for and receive a new permit or a permit extension for additional time. This
supplementary application must be submitted to the City prior to the permit end date.
Section 520.280. Other Obligations.
[Ord. No. 1002 §16, 8-9-2000]
Obtaining a right-of-way permit under this Chapter shall not relieve the permittee of its duty to
obtain all other necessary permits, licenses and authority and to pay all fees required by any other
City, County, State or Federal rules, laws or regulations. A permittee shall perform all work in full
accord with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the parties and in
accordance with applicable Statutes of the State of Kansas and the rules and regulations of the
Kansas Corporation Commission or any other local, State or Federal agency having jurisdiction
over the parties. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and
established rules and regulations and shall be responsible for all work done in the right-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who the work is done by.
Except in cases of emergency and with approval of the Public Works Director, no right-of-way
work may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such
work.
A permittee shall not obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water
through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles may not be parked
within or next to the permit area.
If the City engages in any construction project on its right-of-way which is owned by or under the
control of the City which makes it necessary to remove or relocate any portion of the facilities
owned by permittee, the permittee shall make any necessary relocation at no cost to the City. It is
the intent of this Section for both the City and the permittee to cooperate with one another so that
the need for facility relocation is minimized and, when required and feasible, relocations may be
completed prior to receipt of bids by the City for a public improvement project.
As soon as working drawings are available for City projects which will require the permittee to
relocate its facilities, the City shall provide the permittee with written notice of desired relocations
and the anticipated bid letting date of said project. The permittee shall respond with any conflicts
and a proposed construction schedule within thirty (30) days. Following notice by the City in the
form of the delivery of final design plans, the permittee shall remove and relocate its facilities in
accordance with the mutually agreed upon schedule, provided the project is not delayed by
adverse weather conditions and other factors beyond the control of the permittee.

any other event. In exercising this discretion, the Public Works Director shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the right-of-way and by the
considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare of the general public.

Upon suspension of a license pursuant to this Section, the court shall require the person to
surrender the license to the court, which shall transmit the license to the division of motor vehicles

the licensee may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has expired, the
person may apply for a new license, which shall be issued promptly upon payment of the proper
fee and satisfaction of other conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
suspension or revocation of the person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle is in effect.
As used in this section, "highway" and "street" have the meanings provided by K.S.A. 8-1424 and
8-1473, and amendments thereto.
In lieu of suspending the driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of
this State of any person convicted of violating this Section, as provided in Subsection (D), the
judge of the court in which such person was convicted may enter an order which places conditions
on such person's privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the highways of this State, a certified
copy of which such person shall be required to carry any time such person is operating a motor
vehicle on the highways of this State. Any such order shall prescribe the duration of the conditions
imposed, which in no event shall be for a period of more than one (1) year for a second (2nd)
violation.
Upon entering an order restricting a person's license hereunder, the judge shall require such
person to surrender such person's driver's license to the judge who shall cause it to be transmitted
to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of
vehicles shall issue without charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
have been imposed on such person's privilege of operating a motor vehicle and that a certified
copy of the order imposing such conditions is required to be carried by the person for whom the
license was issued any time such person is operating a motor vehicle on the highways of this
State. If the person convicted is a non-resident, the judge shall cause a copy of the order to be
transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it to the motor vehicle
administrator, of such person's State of residence. Such judge shall furnish to any person whose
driver's license has had conditions imposed on it under this Section a copy of the order, which
shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until such time as the division shall issue the
restricted license provided for in this Section.
Upon expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant to this
Subsection, the licensee may apply to the division for the return of the license previously
surrendered by such licensee. In the event such license has expired, such person may apply to
the division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the division upon payment of
the proper fee and satisfaction of the other conditions established by law, unless such person's
privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this State has been suspended or revoked
prior thereto. If any person shall violate any of the conditions imposed under this Subsection, such
person's driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this State shall
be revoked for a period of not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one (1) year by the judge of
the court in which such person is convicted of violating such conditions.
It shall be an affirmative defense to any prosecution under this Section that an occupant of the
vehicle other than the defendant was in exclusive possession of the alcoholic liquor.
The court shall report to the division every conviction of a violation of this Section or of a City
ordinance or county resolution that prohibits the acts prohibited by this Section. Prior to sentencing
under the provisions of this Section, the court shall request and shall receive from the division a
record of all prior convictions obtained against such person for any violations of any of the motor
vehicle laws of this State.
For the purpose of determining whether a conviction is a first (1st), second (2nd) or subsequent
conviction in sentencing under this Section:

of any County, which prohibits the acts that this Section prohibits;

convictions in determining the sentence to be imposed within the limits provided for a first
(1st), second (2nd) or subsequent offender, whichever is applicable; and
It is irrelevant whether an offense occurred before or after conviction for a previous offense.
This Section shall not be construed as preventing any City from enacting ordinances, or any
county from adopting resolutions, declaring acts prohibited by this Section as unlawful or
prohibited in such City or County and prescribing penalties for violation thereof, but such
ordinance or resolution shall provide for suspension or restriction of driving privileges as provided
by this Section and the convicting court shall be required to report convictions for violations of

Chapter 607. Sexually Oriented Businesses - Regulations
Section 607.010. Purpose and Findings.
[Ord. No. 1166 §I, 7-13-2005]
Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to
promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
sexually oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this Chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this
Chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment
to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Chapter to condone or legitimize
the distribution of obscene material.
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the
community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Council and on findings
incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986), Young
v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991),
City of Erie v. Pap's AM, TDA "Kandyland ", 529 U.S. 277 (2000) and City of Los Angeles v.
Alameda Books, Inc., 121 5. Ct. 1223 (2001) and on studies in other communities including, but
not limited to, Kansas City, Missouri; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier,
California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and
Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group
On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the
Council finds:
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful and unhealthy activities
that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is
presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises.
Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this Chapter as adult theatres
and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than
employees of other establishments.
Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented
businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for
viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
Offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy
conditions.
Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses
for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually
oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human

immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B
amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported
cases of AIDS caused by the human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) in the United States —
600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31,
1992.
Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons
testing positive for the HIV antibody test.
The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis in the United States reported
annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of
1990.
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high
level, with over one-half million (500,000) cases being reported in 1990.
The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the
American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact,
intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an
infected mother to her newborn.
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and
gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the
activities conducted there are unhealthy and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the
activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually
oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
The findings noted in Subparagraphs number (1) through (15) raise substantial governmental
concerns.
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that
reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore non-existent incentive on the
operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the
health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the
sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities
occurring therein.
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult
booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult theatres.
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current
employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of
criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by
preventing minors from working in such establishments.

The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-today
operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is
substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will
aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited
amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which
this Chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related
crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in
contravention of this Chapter.

state the names and contact information of the aggrieved person, the person(s) alleged to have
committed the unlawful discriminatory practice(s), and the respondent; shall describe the unlawful
act or discriminatory practice; and shall include all other information as may be required by the

all information requested has been provided to the extent such requested information is
reasonably available to the aggrieved individual.

practice, unless the act complained of constitutes a continuing pattern or practice of
discrimination, in which event it must be filed within sixty (60) days of the last act of discrimination.
On receipt of a completed complaint, the investigator shall notify the respondent of the complaint,
providing sufficient details related to the complaint so that the respondent may respond. The
investigator shall give the respondent a specific date by which to file an answer to the complaint
and provide any documentation or evidence related to the complaint. The investigator may, at the
respondent's request, extend the answer period to a date certain as the investigator deems
appropriate.
Following the conclusion of the answer period the investigator may initiate further investigation,

statements as needed to facilitate the investigation of the complaint. The investigator shall have
the power to issue process and compel the production of documents and information. Such

unlawful discriminatory practice. If the investigator finds that probable cause did not exist, then the
investigator shall notify the complainant and respondent, and no further action shall be taken by
the City. If the investigator finds that probable cause exists that an unlawful discriminatory practice

complaint between the parties. If a party refuses to participate in conciliation and settlement, or if a
settlement agreement is not executed within sixty (60) days of the date of the finding of probable

cause, the matter shall be referred to the hearing officer for a hearing. The investigator shall
maintain all evidence received during the investigation for a period of two (2) years after the
deadline for appeal or completion of appeal, whichever is later.
Upon referral to the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall schedule a hearing on the complaint.
The hearing officer shall have the power to administer oaths and to issue process and compel the
attendance of any party or witness. Such process shall be executed by the Chief of Police and
shall be enforced as in all cases of City ordinances. At such hearing, the parties and the
investigator shall be entitled to call witnesses and to present such other evidence as appropriate.
The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures as may be established by the
hearing officer, but the rules of evidence used in courts of law need not be strictly enforced.
Following the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer may announce a determination or may
take the matter under advisement for determination at a later date. Any determination of the
hearing officer shall be in writing, shall be based upon the preponderance of the evidence, and
shall set forth the essential elements of the determination.
If the hearing officer finds that a violation of this Chapter has occurred, the hearing officer may
award to the complainant actual damages, or a civil penalty in the amount of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00), whichever is greater, for each violation. In addition, the investigator's fees and the
hearing officer's fees shall be assessed to the non-prevailing party unless the hearing officer
determines that the circumstances warrant assessing the costs in some other manner.
Any individual aggrieved by a determination of the hearing officer under this Section or any
determination of insufficient evidence to warrant a hearing made by the Investigator, may appeal
that determination to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas, in accordance with K.S.A. 60-
2101(d), and amendments thereto. Within thirty (30) days of service of the notice of appeal
pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d), or within further time allowed by the court or by other provision of
law, the City shall transmit to the court the original or a copy of the written determination of the
hearing officer and all documents or evidence considered by the hearing officer in considering the
complaint or rendering the written determination. On appeal, the district court may enter such
order or judgment as justice shall require, and may award court costs and reasonable attorney
fees to the prevailing party.
The hearing officer shall preserve all evidence presented at the hearing for a period of two (2)
years after the deadline for appeal or completion of appeal, whichever is later.
The filing of a complaint for the alleged violation of this Chapter shall in no way preclude any
person from seeking other relief under state or Federal law. Further, due to the existence of state
and Federal legal processes to address allegations of discrimination based on race, religion, color,
sex, disability, familial status, national origin, ancestry, or military status, the City will direct those
seeking to file a complaint for the alleged violation of this Chapter arising out of discrimination
based on race, religion, color, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, ancestry, or military
status of the appropriate state or Federal agency in which such complaints may be filed.
Section 615.050. Severability.
Should any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Chapter, or the application thereof
to any individual or circumstance, be declared to be unconstitutional or invalid or unenforceable, such
determination shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Chapter.

Section 700.120. Storm Water Management Service Fee.
[Ord. No. 1125 §6, 8-25-2004]
Service Fee Established. Subject to the provisions of this Article, there is imposed on each and
every residential developed property and non-residential developed property, other than property
that is not serviced by the storm water management system or exempt property, a storm water
management service fee. This storm water management service fee shall be determined and set
by the provisions of this Article in accordance with the ERU and ERU rate, which is established by
ordinance or resolution of the City Council and which may be amended from time to time by the
City Council.
Storm Water Management Service Fee For Residential Developed Property. The storm water
management service fee for residential developed property shall be the ERU rate multiplied by the
number of individual residential units existing on the property. In the event of a newly constructed
residential unit, the charge for the storm water management service fee attributable to that
residential unit shall commence upon the issuance of the building permit for that residential unit, or
if construction is at least fifty percent (50%) complete and is halted for a period of three (3)
months, then that residential unit shall be deemed complete and the storm water management
service fee shall commence at the end of the three (3) month period.
Storm Water Management Service Fee For Non-Residential Developed Property.
The storm water management service fee for non-residential developed property shall be the
ERU rate multiplied by the numerical factor calculated by dividing the total impervious area of
a non-residential developed property by the number of square feet in one (1) ERU. The
minimum storm water management service fee for any non-residential developed property
shall be equal to one (1) ERU. In the event of newly developed non-residential property, the
charge for the storm water management service fee attributable to that development shall
commence upon the issuance of the building permit, or increase in the case of additional
development to property that is already developed property, upon the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy for that additional development, or in the event that no building permit
or certificate of occupancy, as the case may be, will be issued for that development, or in the
event development has halted, then on the date that the Director determines in reasonable
judgment that the development is substantially complete or has been halted for at least three
(3) months.
In the event of non-residential developed property with joint users of common impervious
areas, the Director shall calculate and allocate the pro rata storm water management service
fee among the users. Any owner user disagreeing with the Director's calculation or allocation
may appeal such determination to the Director as provided in Section 700.130.
Residential Unit And Impervious Surface Calculation. The Director shall initially, and from time to
time, determine the number of residential units located on residential developed property in order

information and data deemed pertinent by the Director.
Section 700.130. Appeal Procedure.
[Ord. No. 1125 §7, 8-25-2004]
Persons disagreeing with the calculation of the storm water management user fee or with whether
their property is served by the storm water utility or who believe they are entitled to a credit or to
the continuation of a credit, may appeal the calculation or finding to the City Administrator. The
appellant must file a written notice of appeal, including the basis of the appeal, with the City Clerk
within thirty (30) days following distribution of Johnson County ad valorem tax bills. Non-residential
property owners shall provide information including a land survey prepared by a registered
surveyor showing total property area, type of surface material, and impervious area. Based on the
information provided, the City Administrator shall make a determination as to whether the storm
water management user fee should be adjusted or eliminated for the subject property. The City
Administrator shall notify the appellant in writing of the decision.
A person shall have the right to appeal the decision of the City Administrator to the City Council.
Such appeal shall be made within ten (10) days of the date of the City Administrator's written
decision and shall be perfected in the same manner as the original appeal. The City Council shall
consider the appeal and issue a written decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days of the receipt
of the perfected appeal.
The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence,
that the determination of the user fee is erroneous.
The filing of a notice of appeal shall not stay the imposition, calculation or duty to pay the fee. The
appellant shall pay the storm water management user fee to Johnson County, Kansas stated in
the billing. If either the City Administrator or the City Council determines that the appellant should
not pay a fee, pay a fee amount less than the amount appealed, or receive a credit, the City shall
issue a check to the appealing party in the appropriate amount within ten (10) days of the date of
