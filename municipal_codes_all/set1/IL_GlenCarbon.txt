2617. The Chief will then advise the Village Administrator of the activities. If the activity involves the Village
Administrator, the Chief will then contact the Village Attorney or the Mayor. The Village Attorney or Mayor will then
notify the Village Board of Trustees. If the activity involves the Chief of Police the employee, official, or vendor will
contact the Village Administrator or Mayor. The Village Administrator or Mayor will then notify the Village Board of

to a specific cash flow, the Village will not directly invest in securities maturing more than five (5) years from the date of purchase.

nearly as practicable with the expected use of the funds.
L. Internal Control.

designed to insure that the invested assets of the Village are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall
be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The controls shall be designed to prevent the loss of
public funds arising from fraud, employee error, and misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets
and imprudent actions by authorized investment officers. The system of internal controls and operational procedures shall be
documented in writing and made available to individuals authorized to invest funds on behalf of the Village.
M. Performance Standards.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 31/338
1. Direct Communication And Documentation: Employees who either observe or believe they have observed harassment or any other inappropriate
conduct based on matters protected under this section are encouraged to deal with the incident as directly and firmly as possible by clearly
communicating to the offending employee, if possible or practical under the circumstances. The harassed employee is encouraged to directly and
clearly express any objection to unwelcome conduct and request that the behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages
are needed, they should be put in writing, with a copy given to a supervisor. Each incident should be documented, including what was said or done,
the date, time, and place, even if not taken immediately to a supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person
making a complaint.
2. Communication With Supervisor: In the event an employee is either not comfortable discussing directly with the offending employee, if direct
communication is not possible with the offending employee, or if prior communication with the offending employee was not successful, the employee
is encouraged to immediately report the matter either to: a) their department supervisor/manager; b) to any other supervisor/manager with whom the
employee feels comfortable; c) to Human Resources; or d) to the Village Administrator. If an employee is unsure of with whom to raise an issue of
harassment, or if an employee has not received a satisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting any incident of what the
employee perceives to be harassment, employees are encouraged to immediately contact Human Resources or the Village Administrator. If the
employee complaint involves the Village Administrator, the employee may contact either the Village Attorney or the Mayor. They will see that Village
Board of Trustees is made aware of the situation and that an investigation is immediately conducted. Every report of perceived harassment will be
fully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate.
3. No Retaliation: No person making a complaint under this section will be retaliated against, even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In
addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation. Accordingly, no elected or appointed official of the Village, or any Village employee,
supervisor, manager or agent shall take any retaliatory action against any Village employee due to the employee's:
a. Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this section;
b. The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of this
section; or
c. Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section.
For the purposes of this section, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
material and significant change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Village employee that is taken in retaliation for an employee's
involvement in protected activity pursuant to this section.
E. Retaliation Protections: Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act3 also provides
whistleblower protection to Village employees from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or
transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
1. Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or other
State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
2. Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or
regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State employee, or
3. Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act4, an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation5.
Pursuant to the Illinois Human Rights Act6, it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a
person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because
he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human
Rights Act.
F. Resolution Outside Department: The purpose of this section is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every report and
incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the Village. However, an employee has the right to contact the Illinois Department of
Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about filing a formal complaint. An IDHR complaint must be filed within one
hundred eighty (180) days of the alleged incident unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300)
days.
G. Consequences For Violation Of This Section: Violation of this section will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge for any employee
who violates this section. In addition, the Village prohibits any form of retaliation by any individual against individuals who report unwelcome conduct or
who cooperate in the investigation of such reports in accordance with this section and the Village will take appropriate disciplinary action for any such
retaliation.
H. Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report: A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment
report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this section shall be
subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements. (Ord. 2018-1, 1-9-2018)

occupations tax act.

the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or
local tax in this state.

prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this section shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is
recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department.
2. Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this section shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for
telecommunications.
D. Returns To Department: Commencing on February 1, 2003, the tax imposed under this section on telecommunication retailers shall be returned with
appropriate forms and information as required by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal telecommunications tax act (public act 92-
526, section 5-50) and any accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement this act.
E. Resellers:
1. If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax
authorized by this section on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require.
2. Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax
free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales.
3. Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.
F. Severability: If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision of this section, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such
occurrence shall not affect other provisions of this section, or their application, that can be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision
or its application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this section.
G. Effective Date: This section shall take effect on January 1, 2003. Copies of ordinance 2002-30 shall be certified and sent to the Illinois department of
revenue prior to October 1, 2002.

may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless
the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case, the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax
and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid
within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 2000-62, 12-12-2000)

local tax administrator shall:
A. Timely remove the lien at village's expense;

1-12-2: SCOPE:
This program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated by the village
(water, sewer, and refuse) by any and all personnel of the village, including management personnel. This program does not replace or repeal any
previously existing policies or programs addressing some or all of the activities that are the subject of this program, but rather it is intended to supplement
any such existing policies and programs. (Ord. 2009-08, 6-9-2009)

a different meaning:
COVERED ACCOUNT: An account that the village of Glen Carbon offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments of transactions (16 CFR 681.2(b)(3)(i)). A utility account is a "covered account". The term "covered account"
also includes other accounts offered or maintained by the village for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to the village or its customers from
identity theft (16 CFR 681.2(b)(3)(ii)).
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: Any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including any name, social security number, date of birth, official state or government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number. Additional examples of "identifying information" are set forth in 16 CFR

credit reporting act of 1970 (15 USC 1681 et seq.), as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 signed into law on December 4,
2003 (public law 108-159). (Ord. 2009-08, 6-9-2009)
1-12-4: POLICY:
A. Administration Of The Program: Issues to be addressed in the annual identity theft prevention report include:
1. The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts and
activity with respect to existing covered accounts.
2. Service provider arrangements.
3. Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response.
4. Recommendations for material changes to the program, if needed for improvement.
B. Identity Theft Prevention Elements:
1. Identification Of Relevant Red Flags: The village of Glen Carbon has considered the guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags
from the FTC's identity theft rules and has reviewed the village's past history with instances of identity theft, if any. The municipality hereby
determines that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this program given the relative size of the village and the limited nature and
scope of the services that the village provides to its citizens:
a. Alerts, Notifications, Or Other Warnings Received From Consumer Reporting Agencies Or Service Providers:
(1) A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
(2) A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report.
(3) A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in section 681.1(b) of the FTC's identity theft rules.
(4) A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer,
such as:
(A) A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
(B) An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
(C) A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or
(D) An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
b. The Presentation Of Suspicious Documents:
(1) Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or forged.
(2) The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
(3) Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
(4) Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the village, such as a signature
card or a recent check.
(5) An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
c. The Presentation Of Suspicious Personal Identifying Information, Such As A Suspicious Address Change:
(1) Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the village. For example:
(A) The address does not match any address in the consumer report or CRA ID check response; or
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 50/338
(B) The social security number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the social security administration's death master file.
(2) Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer.
For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.
(3) Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third party sources used by the
village. For example:
(A) The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or
(B) The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.
(4) Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third party sources
used by the village. For example:
(A) The billing address on an application is fictitious, a maildrop, or a prison; or
(B) The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.
(5) The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers.
(6) The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers.
(7) The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
(8) Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the village.
(9) If the village uses challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.
d. The Unusual Use Of, Or Other Suspicious Activity Related To, A Covered Account:
(1) Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the village receives a request for the addition of authorized users on
the account.
(2) A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated with known fraud patterns. For example: The customer fails to make the first
payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
(3) A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
(4) A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
(5) Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although usage of utility products or services continues in connection with the
customer's covered account.
(6) The village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.
(7) The village is notified of unauthorized usage of utility products or services in connection with a customer's covered account.
e. Notice Of Possible Identity Theft:
(1) The village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
2. Detection Of Red Flags:
a. The employees of the village of Glen Carbon who interact directly with customers on a day to day basis shall have the initial responsibility for
monitoring the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third party service provider in connection with the opening of new
accounts and the modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that
all employees who might be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with modifying or otherwise accessing an
existing account are properly trained such that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in this program, so as to be able
to recognize any red flags that might surface in connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to recognize the red
flags identified in this program shall not open a new account for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer with
access to information in an existing account without the direct supervision and specific approval of a management employee. Management
employees shall be properly trained such that they can recognize the relevant red flags identified in this program and exercise sound judgment in
connection with the response to any unresolved red flags that may present themselves in connection with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or accessing an existing account. Management employees shall be responsible for making the final decision on any such unresolved red
flags.
b. The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may
apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer with the application in verifying the customer's identity and the

a. If the responsible employees of the village of Glen Carbon as set forth in the previous subsection are unable, after making a good faith effort, to
form a reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing
account based on the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third party service provider, the village shall not open the
new account or modify or otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be. Discrimination in respect to the opening of new
accounts or the modification or access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the village and shall be grounds for immediate
dismissal.
b. The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an unresolved red flag
situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that
results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent individual or
website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity theft when a red flag is detected include:
(1) Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
(2) Contacting the customer.
(3) Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a covered account.
(4) Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
(5) Not opening a new covered account.
(6) Closing an existing covered account.
(7) Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt collector.
(8) Notifying law enforcement.
(9) Determining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances. (Ord. 2009-08, 6-9-2009)
1-12-5: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY:
A. Initial Risk Assessment; Covered Accounts: Utility accounts for personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the definition of
"covered account" in the FTC's identity theft rules. Therefore, the village of Glen Carbon determines that with respect to its residential utility accounts, it
offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The village also performed an initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or maintains any
other accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or the utility from identity theft. In making this determination the village
considered: 1) the methods it uses to open its accounts, 2) the methods it uses to access its accounts, and 3) its previous experience with identity theft,
and it concluded that it does not offer or maintain any such other covered accounts.
B. Program Updates; Risk Assessment: The program, including relevant red flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the program update include:
1. An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
2. Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or procedures.
3. Changes in methods of identity theft.
4. Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
5. Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
C. Training And Oversight: All staff and third party service providers performing any activity in connection with one or more covered accounts are to be
provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures
designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.
D. Other Legal Requirements: Awareness of the following related legal requirements should be maintained:
1. 31 USC 5318(g) - Reporting of suspicious activities;
2. 15 USC 1681c-1(h) - Identity theft prevention; fraud alerts and active duty alerts - limitations on use of information for credit extensions;
3. 15 USC 1681s-2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies;
4. 15 USC 1681m - Requirements on use of consumer reports. (Ord. 2009-08, 6-9-2009)
1-12-6: RESPONSIBILITY:
The initial adoption and approval of the identity theft prevention program shall be by ordinance of the village's board of trustees. Thereafter, changes to the
program of a day to day operational character and decisions relating to the interpretation and implementation of the program may be made by the village
clerk (program administrator). Major changes or shifts of policy positions under the program shall only be made by the village's board of trustees.
Development, implementation, administration and oversight of the program will be the responsibility of the program administrator. The program
administrator may, but shall not be required to, appoint a committee to administer the program. The program administrator shall be the head of any such
committee. The program administrator will report at least annually to the mayor regarding compliance with this program. (Ord. 2009-08, 6-9-2009)

Chapter 6
CABLE COMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY CODE
3-6-1: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the CABLE COMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY CODE. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A. Purpose: The village finds that further development of cable systems has the potential to be of great benefit to the village and its residents and
businesses. Cable technology is rapidly changing, and cable plays an essential role as part of the village's basic infrastructure. Cable systems
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 87/338
extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rights of way, in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them, and in a
manner reserved primarily for those who provide services to the public, such as utility companies. A cable company currently typically faces very
limited competition; thus, the grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and places the holder in a position of
public trust. Because of these facts, the village finds that public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory
powers vested in the village or such persons as the village so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in
the public interest. In light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter:
1. Cable service should be available to as many village residents and businesses as possible and provide the widest possible diversity of information
sources and services to the public.
2. A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cable related needs of the community.
3. A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum
extent possible into existing system facilities, taking into account all relevant factors including costs.
4. A cable system should grow and develop and be responsive to the needs and interests of the community.
B. Intent: The village intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes, and
that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof. (Ord. 96-
31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-3: APPLICABILITY TO EXISTING FRANCHISES AND AGREEMENTS:
To the extent permitted by law, this chapter shall apply to franchises and other agreements in effect at the time of adoption of this chapter. (Ord. 96-31, 10-
8-1996)
3-6-4: LANGUAGE AND DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words, and abbreviations shall have the meanings given herein, unless otherwise expressly
stated. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense and vice versa, words in the plural number include
the singular number and vice versa, and the masculine gender includes the feminine gender and vice versa. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory,
and "may" is permissive. Unless otherwise expressly stated or clearly contrary to the context, terms, phrases, words, and abbreviations not defined herein
shall be given the meanings set forth in title 47 of the United States code, chapter 5, subchapter V-A, 47 USC section 521 et seq., as amended, and
regulations issued pursuant thereto, and, if not defined therein, their common and ordinary meanings. For convenience, federal and state definitions are
set forth in the glossary attached to ordinance 96-31, which ordinance is on file in the office of the village clerk, which glossary may be revised by the
village attorney to reflect subsequent changes in federal law without the need for an amendment of this chapter.

subject to this chapter, the terms and conditions under which a franchise will be exercised.

FRANCHISE TRANSFER: A. "Franchise transfer" shall mean any transaction in which: 1) any ownership or other right, title, or interest of more than ten
percent (10%) in a franchisee or its cable system is transferred, sold, assigned, leased, sublet, mortgaged, or otherwise disposed of or encumbered
directly or indirectly, voluntarily or by foreclosure or other involuntary means, in whole or in part; or 2) there is any change in or substitution of, or
acquisition or transfer of control of, the franchisee or any person which has more than a ten percent (10%) interest in a franchisee or has responsibility for
or control over a franchisee's operations or over the system; or 3) the rights or obligations held by the franchisee under the franchise are transferred,
directly or indirectly, to another person.
B. "Control" means the legal or practical ability to direct the affairs of another person, either directly or indirectly, whether by contractual agreement,
majority ownership interest, any lesser ownership interest, or in any other manner.
C. A rebuttable presumption that a change, acquisition, or transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation of a ten
percent (10%) or larger ownership interest by any person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already have more than a fifty percent
(50%) ownership interest, alone or collectively.
D. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "franchise transfer" does not include:
1. Disposition or replacement of worn out or obsolete equipment, property or facilities in the normal course of operating a cable system, including the
renewal or extension of equipment or property leases and contracts; or
2. Acquisition, transfer, sale or other disposition of leases, licenses, easements, and other interests in real property in the normal course of operating
a cable system and not involving the relinquishment of any right or power affecting the franchisee's ability to provide services in whole or in part; or
3. Pledge or mortgage of a franchisee's assets to a financial institution in return for sums necessary to construct or operate (or both) the cable
system; provided, that such pledge or mortgage and related agreements obligate and limit such financial institution as follows: any foreclosure or
exercise of lien over the franchise or facilities shall only be by assumption of control over the entire cable system; prior to assumption of control,
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 88/338
the institution shall notify the village that it or a designee acceptable to the village will take control of and operate the system, and shall submit a
plan for such operation ensuring continued service and compliance with this chapter and all franchise obligations during the term the institution
exercises such control; and the institution shall not exercise control for longer than one year unless extended by the village for good cause and
shall, prior to the expiration of such period (as extended), obtain the village's approval of a franchise transfer for the remaining term of the
franchise or award of a new franchise to another qualified person pursuant to this chapter.
FRANCHISEE: A person that has been granted a franchise by the village in accordance with this chapter.
GROSS REVENUES: Any and all cash, credits, property or other consideration of any kind or nature, received directly or indirectly, by a franchisee or its

subscribers for any basic, optional, premium, per-channel, per-program, or other service; installation, disconnection, reconnection, and change-in-service
fees; leased channel fees; late fees and processing fees; fees or payments received from programmers for carriage of programming on the system (which
does not include contributions to joint marketing efforts); revenues from rentals or sales of converters or other equipment; studio rental and production
fees; advertising revenues; revenues from program guides; and revenues from home shopping and bank-at-home channels. "Gross revenues" shall not
include any franchise fees hereunder or any taxes on services furnished by a franchisee or other person which are imposed directly on any subscriber or
user by the United States, the state of Illinois, the village, or other governmental unit and which are collected by a franchisee or other person on behalf of
said governmental unit. "Gross revenues" shall not include revenues of another person to the extent already included in the "gross revenues" of one
person hereunder, or any proceeds from the sale or exchange of the system. "Gross revenues" shall not include revenues for goods and services which
are not provided over the system, even if such goods and services are ordered using the system. In the event a person receives revenues for operations
within and without the village of which no specific portion can be attributed to operations in the village, "gross revenues" with respect to such revenues
shall mean the portion thereof derived by multiplying such revenues by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of subscribers in the village and
the denominator of which is the total number of subscribers in the area generating such revenues.
NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS: Eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. to five o'clock (5:00) P.M. Monday through Friday.
NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS: Those service conditions that are within the control of a franchisee. Conditions that are not within the control of a
franchisee include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages in excess of two (2) hours in length, telecommunications
network outages, and severe or unusual weather conditions. Conditions that are within the control of a franchisee include, but are not limited to, special
promotions, rate increases, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, maintenance or upgrade of the cable system, and power outages of two (2) hours
or less in length.
PERSON: An individual, partnership, limited liability corporation or partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, organization, corporation, or other
entity, or any lawful successor thereto or transferee thereof, but such term does not include the village.
PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY: The surface, the air space above the surface, and the area below the surface of any public street, right of way, highway, lane,
path, alley, way for public service facilities, sidewalk, boulevard, drive, bridge, tunnel, park, parkway, waterway, easement, playgrounds, school grounds, or
similar property in which the village now or hereafter holds any property interest, which, consistent with the purposes for which it was dedicated, may be
used for the purpose of installing and maintaining a cable system. No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to a "public right of way" shall be
deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the village that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for
such purposes, and a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the village and as the village may have the undisputed
right and power to give.
RFP: Request for proposal.
SALE: Any sale, exchange, or barter transaction.
SERVICE INTERRUPTION: The loss of picture or sound on one or more cable channels.
SUBSCRIBER: Any person who legally receives any cable service delivered over a cable system and the village in its capacity as a recipient of such
service.

contrasted with the receipt thereof in the capacity of a subscriber.
VILLAGE: The village of Glen Carbon, Illinois, and its agencies, departments, agents, and employees acting within their respective areas of authority. (Ord.
96-31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-5: GRANT OF FRANCHISE:
A. Franchise Granted: The village may grant one or more cable television franchises containing such provisions as are reasonably necessary to protect
the public interest, and each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter. This chapter may be
amended from time to time, and in no event shall this chapter be considered a contract between the village and a franchisee such that the village would
be prohibited from amending any provision hereof; provided, no such amendment shall in any way impair any contract right or increase obligations of a
franchisee under an outstanding and effective franchise except the lawful exercise of the village's police power.
B. Franchise Required:
1. No person may construct, operate, or maintain a cable system or provide cable service over a cable system within the village without a franchise
granted by the village authorizing such activity. No person may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the
village pursuant to this chapter. For the purpose of this provision, the operation of part or all of a cable system within the village means the use or
occupancy by facilities of public rights of way within the village whether or not any subscriber within the village is served. A system shall be deemed
as using or occupying public rights of way even though such use or occupancy is solely by reason of use of distribution facilities furnished by a
telephone or other company pursuant to tariff or contract. A system shall not be deemed as operating within the village even though service is
offered or rendered to one or more subscribers within the village if no public right of way is used or occupied. The location within the village of a
microwave or similar relay, interconnection or program origination facility not involving the use or occupancy of public rights of way shall not be
deemed operation within the village. In all respects, franchise agreements shall be issued so as to provide equal protection under the law and to
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 89/338
prevent unlawful disparate treatment of persons which operate or construct cable systems or provide cable services over a cable system, including
as required by 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-42-11.
2. To the extent a common carrier (or any other person) is providing video programming to subscribers using radio communications, such common
carrier (or other person) must obtain a franchise as required pursuant to this chapter but shall not be subject to requirements imposed by the cable
act through this chapter. To the extent a common carrier is providing transmission of video programming on a common carrier basis, such common
carrier must obtain a franchise as required pursuant to this chapter but shall not be subject to requirements imposed by the cable act through this
chapter (but this section shall not affect the treatment of a facility of a common carrier as a cable system). To the extent a common carrier (or any
other person) is providing video programming by means of an open video system pursuant to certification approved by the FCC, such common
carrier (or other person) need not obtain a franchise pursuant to this chapter but shall be subject to requirements imposed by the cable act through
this chapter as permitted by federal law, and shall pay to the village fees on gross revenues for the provision of cable service equal to and in lieu of
the franchise fee imposed hereunder on cable operators in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. To the extent that a common carrier is
providing video programming to its subscribers in a manner other than that described in this subsection B2, such common carrier must obtain a
franchise as required pursuant to this chapter and shall be subject to requirements imposed by the cable act through this chapter.
C. Length Of Franchise: No franchise shall initially be granted for a period of more than twenty (20) years or less than four (4) years; except, that a
franchisee may apply for renewal or extension pursuant to this chapter.
D. Franchise Characteristics:
1. A franchise authorizes use of public rights of way for installing, operating, and maintaining cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit,
and other devices necessary and appurtenant to the operation of a cable system to provide cable services within a franchise area, but does not
expressly or implicitly authorize a franchisee to provide service to, or install a cable system on private property without owner consent through
eminent domain or otherwise (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to and consistent with section 621 of the cable act, 47 USC section
541[a][2]), or to use publicly or privately owned poles, ducts or conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.
2. A franchise shall not mean or include any franchise, license, or permit for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the village as
generally required by the ordinances and laws of the village other than this cable communications regulatory code, or for attaching devices to poles
or other structures, whether owned by the village or other person, or for excavating or performing other work in or along public rights of way. A
franchise shall not confer any authority to provide telecommunications services or any other communications services besides cable services. A
franchise shall not confer any implicit rights other than those mandated by federal, state or local law.
3. A franchise is nonexclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly: a) preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the
village; b) affect the village right to authorize use of public rights of way by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it
determines appropriate; or c) affect the village right to itself construct, operate, or maintain a cable system, with or without a franchise; provided,
however, that in considering whether to grant a franchise in addition to an existing franchise or to own, lease, and/or operate a municipal system, the
village shall comply with state law, including 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-42-11.
4. Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the village and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall constitute a valid and
enforceable contract between the franchisee and the village, and the terms, conditions, and provisions of such franchise agreement, subject to this
chapter and all other duly enacted and applicable laws, shall define the rights and obligations of the franchisee and the village relating to the
franchise.
5. All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the public rights of way, and the village reserves the
right to reasonably designate where a franchisee's facilities are to be placed within the public rights of way through its generally applicable permit
procedures without materially adding to the obligations of the franchisee.
6. A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to the original franchisee. No franchise transfer shall occur without the prior
written consent of the village upon application made by the franchisee pursuant to this chapter and the franchise agreement, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, and any purported franchise transfer made without application and prior written consent shall be void and shall be cause
for the village to revoke the franchise agreement.
E. Franchisee Subject To Other Laws, Police Power:
1. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including this chapter. A franchisee
shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the village including, but not limited to, all rights the village may have under 47
USC section 552, all powers regarding zoning, supervision of construction, assurance of equal employment opportunities, control of public rights of
way, and consumer protection.
2. No course of dealing between a franchisee and the village, or any delay on the part of the village in exercising any rights hereunder, shall operate as
a waiver of any such rights of the village or acquiescence in the actions of a franchisee in contravention of such rights except to the extent expressly
waived in writing or expressly provided for in a franchise agreement.
3. The village shall have full authority to regulate cable systems, franchisees, and franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully permissible. Except
where rights are expressly waived by a franchise agreement, they are reserved, whether or not expressly enumerated.
F. Interpretation Of Franchise Terms:
1. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and a franchise agreement, the provisions of the franchise agreement control except where the conflict
arises from the lawful exercise of the village's police power.
2. The provisions of this chapter and a franchise agreement will be liberally construed in accordance with generally accepted rules of contract
construction and to promote the public interest.
G. Operation Of A Cable System Without A Franchise: Any person who occupies public rights of way for the purpose of operating or constructing a cable
system or provides cable service over a cable system and who does not hold a valid franchise from the village shall be subject to all requirements of
this chapter including, but not limited to, its provisions regarding construction and technical standards and franchise fees. In its discretion, the village at
any time may by ordinance: 1) require such person to enter into a franchise agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written notice to such
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 90/338
person from the village that a franchise agreement is required; 2) require such person to remove its property and restore the affected area to a
condition satisfactory to the village within such time period; 3) grant a revocable permit to operate for a period not to exceed two (2) years, provided
such period begins on the expiration date of a franchise previously issued to such person; 4) direct village personnel to remove the property and
restore the affected area to a condition satisfactory to the village and charge the person the costs therefor, including by placing a lien on the person's
property as provided in connection with abating nuisances; or 5) take any other action it is entitled to take under applicable law. In no event shall a
franchise be created unless it is issued by ordinance of the village pursuant to this chapter and subject to a written franchise agreement.
H. Acts At Franchisee's Expense: Any act that a franchisee is or may be required to perform under this chapter, a franchise agreement, or applicable law
shall be performed at the franchisee's expense, without reimbursement by the village, unless expressly provided to the contrary in this chapter, the
franchise agreement, or applicable law.
I. Eminent Domain: Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the village's power of eminent domain.
The village may exercise its right of eminent domain on behalf of a franchisee consistent with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-42-11.
J. Exclusive Contracts And Anticompetitive Acts Prohibited:
1. No franchisee or other multichannel video programming distributor shall enter into or enforce an exclusive contract for the provision of cable service
or other multichannel video programming with any person, or demand the exclusive right to serve a person or location, as a condition of extending
service to that or any other person or location.
2. No franchisee or other multichannel video programming distributor shall engage in acts that have the purpose or effect of limiting competition for the
provision of cable service or services similar to cable service in the village, except for such actions as are expressly authorized by law.
3. Property owners, condominium associations, managing agents, lessees, and other persons in possession or control of any residential building within
a franchise area shall comply with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-42-11.1. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-6: APPLICATIONS FOR GRANT; RENEWAL, MODIFICATION OR TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE:

the future cable-related needs and interests of the community. Upon completion of that proceeding, or after receipt of the application if no such
proceeding is commenced, the board of trustees shall either evaluate the application or issue an RFP, which shall be mailed to the applicant and
made reasonably available to any other interested person. The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in an RFP shall be followed by
each applicant as if set forth and required herein. The village may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the
submission of such information. If the village issues an RFP, it shall evaluate all timely responses.
2. In evaluating an application for a franchise, including a response to an RFP, the village shall consider, among other things, the following factors:
a. The extent to which the applicant substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any franchises in other communities.
b. Whether the quality of the applicant's service under any franchises in other communities, including signal quality, response to customer
complaints, billing practices, and the like, was reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served.
c. Whether there is adequate assurance that the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable service in the village.
d. Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the village and is otherwise reasonably likely to meet the future cablerelated
needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.
e. Whether there is adequate assurance the applicant will provide suitable public, educational, and governmental access facilities.
f. Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted and in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights of way that
would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or
involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights of way.
g. Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or controls any other cable system in the village, or whether grant of the application may
eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the village.
3. If the board of trustees finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set forth above, the village shall prepare a final
written franchise agreement under this chapter that incorporates, as appropriate, the commitments made by the applicant and establish a deadline
for the applicant to sign it and submit it for approval. If the applicant signs the franchise agreement and timely submits it for approval, the village shall
issue a franchise by ordinance adopted no less than thirty (30) days after the filing of the original application.
4. If the board of trustees denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why the franchise was denied.

5. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the board of trustees shall hold a public hearing; however, the village may reject without hearing
any application that is incomplete or fails to respond fully to an RFP.
6. This chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant standing to challenge the issuance of a franchise to another person, or to limit such
standing.
7. If an application seeks authority for a franchise in addition to an existing franchise, the village shall comply with state law, including 65 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/11-42-11.
C. Application For Grant Of Cable Act Franchise Renewal: Applications for franchise renewal under the cable act shall be received and reviewed in a
manner consistent with section 626 of the cable act, 47 USC section 546. If neither a franchisee nor the village activates in a timely manner, or can
activate, the renewal process set forth in 47 USC section 546(a)-(g) (including, for example, if the provisions are repealed), and except as to
applications submitted pursuant to 47 USC section 546(h), the provisions of section B of this section shall apply, and a renewal request shall be
evaluated using the same criteria as any other request for a franchise. The following requirements shall apply to renewal requests properly submitted
pursuant to the cable act:
1. a. If the provisions of 47 USC section 546(a)-(g) are properly invoked, the board of trustees shall, in accordance with the time limits of the cable act,
commence and complete a proceeding to review the applicant's performance under the franchise during the then current franchise term and to
identify future cable-related community needs and interests. Upon completion of the proceeding, the board of trustees may issue an RFP. The board
of trustees, or its designee, shall establish deadlines and procedures for responding to the RFP, may seek additional information from the applicant,
and shall establish deadlines for the submission of such additional information. Alternatively, an applicant can submit a proposal for renewal on its
own initiative.
b. Following receipt of renewal proposals (and such additional information as may be provided in response to requests), the board of trustees will
provide prompt public notice of such proposals and thereafter either determine that the franchise should be renewed or make a preliminary
assessment that the franchise should not be renewed. This determination shall be made in accordance with the time limits established by the
cable act, including sufficient time to comply with the following procedures.
c. If the board of trustees preliminarily determines that the franchise should not be renewed, which determination can be made by resolution, and the
applicant that submitted the renewal proposal notifies the village clerk in writing within twenty (20) days after receipt of the preliminary
determination that it wishes to pursue any rights to an administrative proceeding it has under the cable act, then, if required, the board of trustees
shall commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt public notice thereof, in accordance with the cable act. The village may also
commence such a proceeding on its own initiative if it so chooses.
d. If the board of trustees decides to grant renewal, which decision shall be made by resolution, the village shall prepare a final written franchise
agreement that incorporates, as appropriate, the commitments made by the applicant in the renewal proposal and establish a deadline for the
applicant to sign it and submit it for approval. If the applicant signs the franchise agreement and timely submits it for approval, the village shall
issue a franchise by ordinance. If the franchise agreement is not so accepted and approved within the time limits established by 47 USC section
546(c)(1) and the village renewal shall thereupon be deemed preliminarily denied, and if the applicant notifies the village clerk in writing within
twenty (20) days after the expiration of the time limit established by 47 USC section 546(c)(1) that it wishes to pursue any rights to an
administrative proceeding it has under the cable act, then, if required, the board of trustees shall commence an administrative proceeding after
providing prompt public notice thereof, in accordance with the cable act. The village may also commence such a proceeding on its own initiative if
it so chooses.
2. If an administrative proceeding is commenced pursuant to 47 USC section 546(c), the applicant's renewal proposal shall be evaluated considering
such matters as may be considered consistent with federal law. The following procedures shall apply:
a. The board of trustees shall, by resolution, appoint an administrative hearing officer or officers (referred to hereafter as "hearing officer"). The board
of trustees may appoint itself or one or more of its members as hearing officer or any other qualified person.
b. The hearing officer shall establish a schedule for proceeding which allows for written discovery (requests for admissions, production of documents
and interrogatory responses), production of evidence, and subpoenaing and cross-examination of witnesses. Depositions shall not be permitted
unless the party requesting the deposition shows that written discovery and hearing subpoena will not provide it an adequate opportunity to require
the production of evidence necessary to present its case. The hearing officer shall have the authority to require the production of evidence as the
interests of justice may require, including to require the production of evidence by the applicant that submitted the renewal proposal and any
affiliate of such applicant. The hearing officer shall not prohibit discovery on the ground that evidence sought is proprietary or involves business
secrets, but rather shall issue protective orders which allow reasonable and necessary discovery without making such information available to
competitors. Any order of the hearing officer may be enforced by imposing appropriate sanctions in the administrative hearing or by action of the
board of trustees.
c. The hearing officer may conduct a prehearing conference and establish appropriate prehearing orders. The village and the applicant shall be the
only parties. The village may have special counsel to represent its interests at the hearing so that the village attorney may advise the board of
trustees as it makes its decision.
d. The hearing officer may require the village and the applicant to submit prepared written testimony prior to the hearing. Unless the parties agree
otherwise, the applicant shall present evidence first, the village shall present evidence second, and the applicant shall be allowed the opportunity
to present rebuttal evidence. Any reports or the transcript or summary of any proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 USC section 546(a) shall, for
purposes of the administrative hearing, be regarded no differently than any other evidence. The village and the applicant must be afforded full
procedural protection regarding evidence related to these proceedings, including the right to refute any evidence introduced in these proceedings
or sought to be introduced by the other party. Both shall have the opportunity to submit additional evidence related to issues raised in the
proceeding conducted pursuant to 47 USC section 546(a).
e. There shall be a transcribed proceeding during which each party will be allowed to present testimony (live, or written if so required) and crossexamine
the witnesses of the other party.
f. Following completion of any hearing, the hearing officer shall require the parties to submit proposed findings of fact with respect to the matters that
the board of trustees is entitled to consider in determining whether renewal ought to be granted. Based on the record of the hearing, the hearing
officer shall then prepare written findings with respect to those matters, and submit those findings, including a decision and the reasons therefor, to
the board of trustees and to the parties (unless the hearing officer is the board of trustees, in which case, the written findings shall constitute the
final decision of the village).
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 92/338
g. If the hearing officer is not the board of trustees, the parties shall have thirty (30) days from the date the findings are submitted to the board of
trustees to file exceptions to those findings. The board of trustees shall thereafter issue a written decision granting or denying the application for
renewal, consistent with the requirements of the cable act, based on the record of such proceeding, stating the reason for the decision. A copy of
the final decision of the board of trustees shall be provided to the parties.
h. The proceeding shall be conducted with due speed. Any decision to renew a franchise shall be made by ordinance enacted no less than thirty (30)
days after the filing of the application and subsequent to preparation of a written franchise agreement consistent with the decision by the village
and signature thereof by the applicant.
i. In conducting the proceeding, and except as inconsistent with the foregoing, the hearing officer will follow the Illinois administrative procedures
act1, as amended. The hearing officer may request that the board of trustees adopt additional reasonable and necessary procedures and
requirements by resolution.
3. This section does not prohibit any franchisee from submitting or the village from considering an informal renewal application pursuant to 47 USC
section 546(h), which application may be granted or denied in accordance with the provisions of 47 USC section 546(h). If such an informal renewal
application is granted, including during the course of formal renewal proceedings, then the steps specified in subsections C1 and C2 of this section
need not be taken, notwithstanding the provisions of those subsections. However, the village will provide the public with adequate notice before
making a decision on such an application, and will make any decision to renew by ordinance enacted no less than thirty (30) days after the filing of
the application, and subsequent to the preparation of a written franchise agreement by the village and signature thereof by the applicant. Unless
otherwise directed by the village, an informal renewal application shall contain the information required under subsection D of this section.
4. The provisions of this chapter shall be read and applied so that they are consistent with section 626 of the cable act, 47 USC section 546, as
amended.
D. Contents Of Franchise And Renewal Applications: An RFP for the grant of a franchise, including for a franchise renewal, shall require, and any
application submitted shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:

E. Application For Modification Of Franchise:
1. An application for modification of a franchise agreement shall include, at minimum, the following information:
a. The specific modification requested;
b. The justification for the requested modification, including the impact of the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the financial

that statute. If the request for modification is not subject to 47 USC section 545, the board of trustees will conduct its review and make its decision by
ordinance enacted no less than thirty (30) days after the application is filed, subsequent to preparation of a modified written franchise agreement by
the village and signature thereof by the applicant.
3. An extension of a franchise term by less than four (4) years shall constitute a modification. An extension of a franchise term by four (4) years or more

F. Franchise Transfers:
1. Village Approval Required: No franchise transfer shall occur without prior written application to and written approval of the board of trustees by
ordinance enacted after a public hearing, and only then upon such terms and conditions as the board of trustees reasonably deems necessary and
proper. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any purported franchise transfer made without such prior approval shall be void and shall be
cause for the village to revoke the franchise agreement. A grant of a franchise involves personal credit, trust, and confidence in the franchisee, and
franchise transfer without the prior written approval of the board of trustees shall be considered to impair the village's assurance of due performance.
The granting of approval for a franchise transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary the approval of any subsequent franchise transfer.
2. Application:
a. The franchisee shall promptly notify the village clerk in writing of any proposed franchise transfer. If any franchise transfer should take place
without prior notice to the village, the franchisee will promptly notify the village clerk in writing that such a franchise transfer has occurred.
b. At least one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the contemplated effective date of a franchise transfer, the franchisee shall submit to the
village clerk an application for approval of the franchise transfer. Such an application shall provide information on the proposed transaction,
including details on the legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, any waivers required from the village under applicable
law, and on the potential impact of the franchise transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a minimum, the following information must be included
in the application:
(1) All information and forms required under federal law.
(2) All information described in subsections D1 through D5, D9, D11 and D13 through D15 of this section regarding the transferee instead of the
applicant, and regarding the franchise transfer rather than initial or renewal franchise.
(3) A description of any business relationships or transactions of any kind, past, present, or anticipated, between the franchisee, or its owners or
affiliates, and the transferee, or its owners or affiliates, other than the proposed transaction.
(4) Any contracts, financing documents, or other documents that relate to the proposed transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits, or the
like referred to therein.
(5) A description of the sources and amounts of the funds to be used in the proposed transaction, indicating how the debt-equity ratio of the
system will change in the course of the transaction; what entities will be liable for repayment of any debt incurred; what interest, payment
schedule, and other terms or conditions will apply to any debt financing; any debt coverages or financial ratios any potential transferees will be
required to maintain over the franchise term if the proposed transaction is approved; what financial resources would be available to the system
under the control of the proposed transferee.
(6) Any other information necessary to provide a complete and accurate understanding of the financial position of the system before and after the
proposed franchise transfer including, but not limited to, projected income statements and cash flow statements, including capital investments,
for at least five (5) years after the proposed franchise transfer, assuming the franchise transfer is approved, stating specifically what
assumptions are being made with respect to any rebuild or upgrade of the system.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 94/338
(7) A statement that the franchisee is in compliance with its franchise obligations over the term of the franchise, or specific descriptions of any
noncompliance of which the franchisee or any potential transferee is aware.
c. For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a franchise transfer, the board of trustees and its agents may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee and such other matters as the board of trustees may deem necessary to determine whether the
franchise transfer is in the public interest and should be approved or denied. The franchisee and any prospective transferees shall assist the board
of trustees in any such inquiry, and if they fail to reasonably cooperate, the request for approval of franchise transfer may be denied. Proprietary
information shall be protected from disclosure to competitors to the extent permitted by law.
3. Determination By Village:
a. In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions an application for approval of a franchise transfer, the board
of trustees shall consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the system; whether any required waivers
under applicable law are in the best interests of the public; whether the franchisee is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this chapter
and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; and whether operation by the transferee on approval of the
franchise transfer would adversely affect the village's interest under this chapter, the franchise agreement, other applicable law, or the public
interest, or make it less likely that the future cable-related needs and interests of the community would be satisfied.
b. The village shall make its determination in accordance with any time limits imposed by federal law, including under 47 USC section 537.
c. Any purported franchise transfer made without the board of trustees's prior written approval shall be void and shall make a franchise subject to
revocation at the board of trustees's sole discretion and make any other remedies available to the village under the franchise or other applicable
law. Acceptance of filing of an application for approval of a franchise transfer later than one hundred twenty (120) days before the purported
effective date of the franchise transfer shall not validate the transaction or excuse the late filing, and in such an instance, the village shall retain the
right to make its decision regarding such a franchise transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days unless action is required sooner by law.
4. Transferee's Agreement: No application for approval of a franchise transfer shall be granted unless and until the proposed transferee submits an
agreement in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations and
liabilities, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee under this chapter and the franchise agreement for all purposes, including renewal, unless
the board of trustees approves a modification of the franchise agreement pursuant to subsection E of this section in conjunction with its approval of
the franchise transfer, in which case, the proposed transferee's agreement shall refer to the franchise agreement as so modified.
5. Approval Does Not Constitute Waiver: Approval by the board of trustees of a franchise transfer does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the
rights of the village under this chapter or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the franchise transfer; however, upon
approval of a franchise transfer, the former franchisee shall be released from prospective liability under the franchise.
G. Filing Fees And Deposits: To be acceptable for filing, an application under this section shall be accompanied by a filing fee in the following amounts to
cover the village's internal administrative costs incidental to the franchising process:
1. For an initial franchise: $1,000.00.
2. For renewal of a franchise under 47 USC section 546(a)-(g): $1,000.00.
3. For renewal of a franchise under 47 USC section 546(h): $500.00.
4. For modification of a franchise agreement: $500.00.
5. For approval of a franchise transfer: $500.00.
H. Public Proceedings: An applicant shall be notified of any public proceedings held in connection with the evaluation of its application and shall be given
an opportunity to be heard thereat. Notice of all public proceedings of the village shall be published and posted in accordance with its usual practices.
I. Intergovernmental Cooperation: By resolution of the board of trustees, any part or all of the process established by this section may be conducted in
concert with other political subdivisions served or to be served by the applicant. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-7: CONSTRUCTION PROVISIONS:
A. System Construction Schedule: Every franchise agreement shall specify the construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade,
or rebuild of the cable system. Failure on the part of a franchisee to commence and diligently pursue such requirements and complete the matters set
forth in its franchise agreement or to comply with the system design and construction plan submitted to the village, including by providing the
equipment specified (or its equivalent) and by following generally accepted installation practices (except insofar as those plans or practices, if carried
out, would result in construction of a system which could not meet requirements of federal, state or local law; and except for such minor modifications
as are typical in the industry), shall be grounds for revocation of its franchise under and pursuant to the terms of subsection 3-6-14E of this chapter;
provided, however, that the board of trustees in its discretion may extend the time for the completion of construction and installation for additional
periods by resolution in the event a franchisee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond its control and requests
such an extension in writing. A franchisee's failure to comply with provisions of the construction plan approved by the board of trustees shall also be
grounds for imposition of penalties pursuant to subsection 3-6-14H of this chapter.
B. Construction Procedures:
1. A franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain the cable system subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the village who have
jurisdiction in such matters, and in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations affecting the system.
2. The system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to periodic inspection by the village.
3. No construction, reconstruction or relocation of the system or any part thereof within the public rights of way shall be commenced until written
permits have been obtained from the proper village officials. In any permit so issued, such officials may impose such conditions and regulations as a
condition of the granting of the permit as are reasonably necessary for the purpose of protecting any structures or facilities in the public rights of way
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 95/338
and for the proper restoration of such public rights of way and structures and facilities, and for the protection of the public and the continuity of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
4. The board of trustees may, by resolution or ordinance, from time to time, issue such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the construction,
operation and maintenance of the system as are consistent with the provisions of this chapter and franchises issued pursuant to this chapter.
C. Construction Standards:
1. The construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of a cable system shall be in accordance with all applicable sections of the occupational safety
and health act of 1970; the national electrical safety code; the national electrical code; national cable television association standards of good
engineering practices; obstruction marking and lighting, federal aviation administration; construction, marking and lighting of antenna structures,
federal communications commission rules part 17; AT&T manual of construction procedures (blue book); franchisee's construction procedures
manual; other federal, state, or local laws and regulations that may apply to the operation, construction, maintenance, or repair of a cable system,
including, without limitation, local zoning and construction codes, and laws and accepted industry practices, all as hereafter may be amended or
adopted. In the event of a conflict among codes and standards, the most stringent code or standard shall apply (except insofar as that code or
standard, if followed, would result in a system that could not meet requirements of federal, state or local law). The village may adopt additional
reasonable standards as required to ensure that work continues to be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner, or to reflect changes in
standards which may occur over a franchise term.
2. All wires, cable lines, and other transmission lines, equipment, and structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the
rights and convenience of property owners, including the village.
3. All electronic equipment shall be of good and durable quality.
4. Without limiting the foregoing, antennas and their supporting structures (towers) shall be designed in accordance with the uniform building code and
electronics industry association RS-22A specifications, as amended, and shall be painted, lighted, erected, and maintained in accordance with all
applicable rules and regulations of the federal aviation administration and all other applicable federal, state, or local laws, codes, and regulations, all
as hereafter may be amended or adopted.
5. Without limiting the foregoing, all of a franchisee's plant and equipment, including, but not limited to, the antenna site, headend and distribution
system, towers, house connections, structures, poles, wires, cable, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, fixtures, and apparatuses, shall be installed,
located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained, and operated in accordance with good engineering practices,
performed by experienced and properly trained maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger any person or property or to
unreasonably interfere in any manner with the public rights of way or legal rights of any property owner, including the village, or unnecessarily hinder
or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
6. All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance, and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall install and
maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices to prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the
public.
7. A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment, or fixtures where they will interfere with any cable, gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer, or other
utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents and businesses in the village of their use of any public
rights of way.
8. Any and all public rights of way, public property, or private property disturbed or damaged during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation,
operation, maintenance, or construction of a system shall be repaired or replaced by the franchisee within a reasonable time specified by the village.
9. A franchisee shall, by a reasonable time specified by the village, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove discrete portions of its
property when required by the village by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right of way construction; public right of way maintenance or
repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public right of way grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes,
power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned communications system, public work or improvement or any governmentowned
utility; public right of way vacation; or for any other purpose where the convenience of the village would be reasonably served thereby;
provided, however, that the franchisee may abandon any property in place if approved by the village in writing; and provided further, that the
franchisee shall not be required to make permanent changes in its facilities to accommodate the installation of another cable system, nor should it be
required to make temporary changes solely to disrupt its business or otherwise provide an unfair advantage to a competitor. No action hereunder
shall be deemed a taking of the property of a franchisee, and a franchisee shall not be entitled to any compensation therefor. No location of any pole
or wire-holding structure of a franchisee shall be a vested interest.
10. If any action under subsection C9 of this section is reasonably required to accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of
another person that is authorized to use the public rights of way, a franchisee shall, after thirty (30) days' advance written notice, take action to effect
the necessary changes requested. The franchisee shall be reimbursed by such other person for costs reasonably incurred in taking such action. The
board of trustees may resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs associated with the removal, relaying, or relocation of facilities as among entities
authorized to install facilities in the public rights of way if the parties are unable to do so themselves, and if the matter is not governed by a valid
contract between the parties. All charges shall be consistent with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-42-11.
11. In the event of an emergency, or where a cable system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the village
may remove, relay, or relocate the pertinent parts of that cable system without prior notice. No charge shall be made by franchisee against the village
for restoration and repair.
12. A franchisee shall, on the request of the village or any person holding a permit issued by the village, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit
the moving of buildings or oversized vehicles. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person
requesting same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance, except in the case where the request is made by
the village on its own behalf, in which case, no such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall be given not less than forty eight (48) hours'
advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes unless the board of trustees has declared an emergency. All charges shall be consistent
with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-42-11.
13. A franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang a public right of way of the village so as to prevent the branches of such trees from
coming in contact with the wires and cables of the franchisee at its own expense, subject to the supervision and direction of the village. Trimming of
trees on private property shall require written permission of the property owner. All cut materials shall be properly disposed.
14. A franchisee shall use, with the owner's permission, existing underground conduits or overhead utility facilities whenever feasible and may not erect
poles in public rights of way without the express written permission of the board of trustees, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Copies of agreements for use of conduits or other facilities shall be filed with the village clerk as required by a franchise agreement or upon village
request.
15. Trunk, feeder and drop cable may be constructed overhead where poles exist and electric, cable television or telephone lines are overhead, but
where no overhead lines exist, all trunk, feeder and drop cable shall be constructed underground. Whenever and wherever all electric lines and
telephone lines are moved from overhead to underground placement, all cable system cables shall be similarly moved, and the cost of movement of
its cable shall be solely the obligation of the franchisee. In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed
underground, on request of franchisee, the developer or property owner shall give a franchisee reasonable notice of the particular date on which
open trenching will be available to franchisee for installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at the franchisee's
expense. The franchisee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring facilities
within the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except, that if the franchisee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or
vaults, and laterals within five (5) working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or property
owner, then should the trenches be closed after the five (5) day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by the franchisee.
16. The village shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge upon any poles or within any conduit owned by a franchisee any wire and pole
fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the franchisee.
17. Prior to construction or rebuild of a cable system, a franchisee shall first submit to the board of trustees for approval a concise description of the
cable system proposed to be erected or installed, including engineering drawings, if required by the board of trustees, together with a map and plans
indicating the proposed location of all such facilities, and obtain written approval therefor from the board of trustees, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
18. Any contractor or subcontractor used for work or construction, installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of system equipment must be properly
licensed under laws of the state and all applicable local ordinances, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same obligations with
respect to its work as a franchisee would have under the franchise agreement and applicable laws if the work were performed by the franchisee. The
franchisee must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all employees who will perform work for it are trained and experienced. The franchisee
shall be responsible for ensuring that the work of contractors and subcontractors is performed consistent with the franchise and applicable law, shall
be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of contractors or subcontractors, shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by any
contractor or subcontractor, and shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the work is properly performed.
19. Upon failure of a franchisee to commence, pursue or complete any work required by law or by the provisions of this chapter to be done in any
street, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of the village, the village may, at its option, after thirty (30) days' notice to
franchisee, cause such work to be done, and the franchisee shall pay to the village the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the village to
franchisee within thirty (30) days after receipt of such itemized report.
20. The franchisee shall make no paving cuts or curb cuts except after written permission has been given by the village, which permission shall not
unreasonably be withheld.
21. The franchisee shall install in conduit all cable passing under any major roadway.
D. Area Served: A franchisee shall build and maintain its system so that within a reasonable period of time, as established by the franchise, it is able to
provide service to all households desiring service located within the franchise area without any construction charges (other than standard connection
charges and drop charges as indicated in subsection E2 of this section). A franchisee must build and maintain its system so that it can extend service
to households desiring service located outside the franchise area in accordance with subsections E1 through E4 of this section. Connections to
commercial customers shall be governed by E5 of this section.
E. Line Extension Requirements:
1. Extension Without Charge To Customer:
a. For areas within the village but outside the franchise area, including areas annexed after the effective date of its franchise (subject to 55 ILCS 5/5-
1095), a franchisee shall, upon request of the board of trustees, extend its trunk and distribution system to serve households desiring service
without any construction charge (other than standard connection charges and drop charges as indicated in subsection E2 of this section), unless
the franchisee demonstrates to the board of trustees's satisfaction evidenced by written decision that circumstances justify a specific charge,
where: 1) the new subscriber requesting service is located within five hundred feet (500') from the termination of the cable system; or 2) the
number of potential subscribers to be passed by such extension is equal to or greater than six (6) potential households per quarter mile measured
from any point on the system.
b. In the event that the requirements set forth in the subsection E1a of this section are not met, the franchisee shall, on request of the board of
trustees, extend its cable system based upon the following cost-sharing formula: the franchisee shall contribute an amount equal to the
construction costs per mile multiplied by the length of the extension in miles, multiplied by a fraction where the numerator equals the number of
potential households per quarter mile at the time of the request and the denominator equals six (6). Households requesting service as of the
completion of construction can be required to bear the remainder of the total construction costs on a pro rata basis.
c. The "construction costs" are defined as the actual turnkey cost to construct the entire extension, including lines, materials, electronics, pole makeready
charges, and labor, but not the cost of drops, except as provided below. If the franchisee proposes to require a household requesting
extension to make a contribution in aid of extension, it must: 1) notify the board of trustees in advance; 2) send the board of trustees a copy of the
invoice showing the amount actually charged each household requesting extension; and 3) within thirty (30) days of completion of the extension,
furnish proof of the total cost of the extension and make any appropriate refunds if the total cost is less than the amounts charged in advance of
construction. At the end of each calendar year, the franchisee must calculate the amount any contributing person would have paid based on the
number of persons served at that time and pay back the difference between the amount actually collected from that person and the amount which
would then be owed. The franchisee shall report such calculations and refunds to the village clerk by the end of January of the following year.
2. Installation Of Drops: Except as federal rate regulations may otherwise require, the franchisee shall not assess any additional cost for service drops
of one hundred fifty feet (150') or less unless the franchisee demonstrates to the board of trustees' satisfaction, evidenced by written decision, that
circumstances justify a specific charge. Where a drop exceeds one hundred fifty feet (150') in length, a franchisee may charge the subscriber for the
difference between franchisee's actual costs associated with installing a one hundred fifty foot (150') drop and the franchisee's actual cost of
installing the longer drop; provided, that drop length shall be the shorter of: a) the actual length of installed drop; or b) the shortest practicable
distance to the point where the franchisee would be required to extend its distribution system.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 97/338
3. Location Of Drops: Except as federal rate regulations may otherwise require, in any area where a franchisee would be entitled to install a drop
aboveground, the franchisee will provide the subscriber the option to have the drop installed underground, but may charge the subscriber the
difference between the actual cost of the aboveground installation and the actual cost of the underground installation.
4. Time For Extension: A franchisee must extend service to any person who requests it: a) within seven (7) days of the request within the franchise
area or where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the existing distribution system; b)
within ninety (90) days of the request for service outside the franchise area where an extension of one-half (1/2) mile or less (but more than 150 feet)
is required; or c) within six (6) months for service outside the franchise area where an extension of one-half (1/2) mile or more is required.
5. Because existing conditions can vary dramatically, franchisee may in its discretion require commercial customers to pay all reasonable costs
(including time and materials) in excess of the average cost of connection for residential services.
F. System Tests And Inspections:
1. Tests: A franchisee shall perform the following tests to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the franchise and other performance
standards established by federal law. All tests shall be conducted in accordance with federal rules and in accordance with the most recent edition of
NCTA's "Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems", or if no recent edition exists, such other appropriate manual as
the parties may designate.
a. Preconstruction Quality Control On Cable And Equipment: A franchisee shall perform preconstruction quality tests on system components. In case
of passive components, this will include testing a significant sample of devices to verify compliance with manufacturer's specifications.
(1) All trunk and distribution cable shall be sweep-tested on the reels to verify compliance with manufacturer's specifications for frequency
response and loss.
(2) All trunk and distribution amplifiers shall be bench-tested to verify compliance with manufacturer's specifications.
(3) No component shall be used in the system which fails to meet manufacturer's specifications. A franchisee shall maintain in the county records
of all preconstruction tests which the village may inspect during normal business hours on reasonable notice.
b. Acceptance Tests: A franchisee shall perform acceptance tests prior to subscriber connection. The tests shall demonstrate that the system
components are operating as expected. The test results shall be submitted to the village clerk for review by the village. The franchisee shall have
the obligation, without further notice from village, to take corrective action if any system components are not operating as expected. Unless the
village determines test results are not adequate to demonstrate system compliance with the standards described above and objects within three
(3) working days of receipt of the test results, the portion of the system covered by the tests will be deemed approved for subscriber connection.
c. Continuing Tests:
(1) The franchisee shall select locations at the extremities of the system to install equipment to establish sufficient permanent test points in
accordance with federal law and sound engineering practices. The franchisee shall perform proof of performance tests at these locations at least
once every six (6) months through the life of the franchise, except as federal law otherwise limits its obligation, and at other times and points
where complaints indicate tests are warranted. The tests shall demonstrate system compliance with technical specifications established
pursuant to franchise, or other applicable law. If the village requests to witness the tests, it shall be notified in writing, delivered to the village
clerk, at least forty eight (48) hours in advance of any testing.
(2) A written report of all test results shall be kept on file by the franchisee and provided to the village clerk on request. If a location fails to meet
performance specifications, the franchisee shall take corrective action and retest the location. The village shall have the option of witnessing
such followup tests and shall be notified in writing, delivered to the village clerk, at least forty eight (48) hours in advance of any such followup
testing.
(3) At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the village may require additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, different test
procedures, or tests involving a specific subscriber's terminal. Requests for such additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints
received or other evidence indicating an unresolved controversy or significant noncompliance, and such tests will be limited to the particular
matter in controversy. The village may conduct such tests independently on three (3) days' advance notice to franchisee. The village will
endeavor to so arrange its requests for such special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the franchisee and the subscriber.
d. Contents Of Test Results: All reports of test results shall include executive summaries.
e. Types Of Test Procedures: Test procedures used in verification of the performance criteria set forth herein, if not as set forth in section 76.609,
subpart K of the FCC rules and regulations, shall be in accordance with good engineering practice and shall be fully described in an attachment to
the annual certificate filed with the village.
f. Acceptance Of Combined Reports: To the extent that the report of measurements as required above may be combined with any reports of
measurements required by the FCC or other regulatory agencies, the village shall accept such combined reports; provided, that all standards and
measurements herein or hereafter established by the village are satisfied.
2. Inspections: The village may conduct inspections of the system, including to assess compliance with the construction and installation practices
manuals and design plans. The franchisee shall be notified in writing of any violations found during the course of inspections. The franchisee must
bring violations into compliance within thirty (30) days of the date notice of violation is given, and must submit a report to the village clerk describing
the steps taken to bring itself into compliance. Inspection does not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to build in compliance with all provisions of
the franchise.
G. Use Of Public Property:
1. Should the grades or boundaries of the public rights of way which the franchisee is authorized to use and occupy be changed at any time during the
term of the franchise granted, the franchisee shall, if necessary, at its own cost and expense, relocate or change its system so as to conform with the
new grades or boundaries.
2. Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to any village, state or other public structures or facilities in the public
rights of way required on account of the construction of the system in the public rights of way shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the
franchisee. During any work of constructing, operating or maintaining the system, the franchisee shall also, at its own cost and expense, protect any

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 98/338
and all existing structures and facilities belonging to the village and any other person. All work performed by the franchisee pursuant to this section
shall be done in such manner prescribed by the village or other officials having jurisdiction thereover.
H. Interference With Public Projects: Nothing in this chapter shall be in preference or hindrance to the right of the village and any board, authority,
commission or public service corporation to perform or carry on any public works or public improvements of any description.
I. Publicizing Proposed Construction Work: Unless not possible due to emergency circumstances, franchisee shall publicize proposed construction work at
least ten (10) days prior to commencement of that work by causing written notice of such construction work to be delivered to the village clerk. In
addition, unless not possible due to emergency circumstances, before entering onto any person's property, a franchisee shall contact the property
owner or occupant at least one day in advance. If a franchisee must enter a private building, it must have permission of the owner or occupant.
J. System Maintenance:
1. Interruptions To Be Minimized: A franchisee shall schedule maintenance so that activities likely to result in an interruption of service are performed
during periods of minimum subscriber use of the system.
2. Maintenance Practices: In addition to its other obligations, a franchisee shall: a) use replacement components of good and durable quality, with
characteristics better or equal to replaced equipment; and b) follow the more stringent of maintenance standards specified in the franchise
agreement, cable televisions industry maintenance standards or franchisee's maintenance standards.
K. Continuity Of Service:
1. It shall be the right of all persons in a franchisee's franchise area to receive all available services from the franchisee as long as their financial and
other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied, and subject to reasonable construction standards and schedules, and subject to availability of legal
access to the location.
2. A franchisee shall make every reasonable effort to provide all subscribers with continuous uninterrupted service. At the village's request, a
franchisee shall operate its system for a temporary period under a revocable permit granted expressly by ordinance or tacitly following the
termination of its franchise or franchise transfer as necessary to maintain service to subscribers, and shall cooperate with the village to assure an
orderly transition from it to another franchisee or system operator (the "transition period"). The transition period shall be no longer than the
reasonable period required for another franchisee to commence service, and shall not be longer than two (2) years. During the transition period, the
franchisee shall continue to be obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of its franchise agreement and applicable laws and regulations, and
will thereupon continue to receive operating revenues during such transition period. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-8: SYSTEM FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES:
A. Compliance With Franchise Agreement: In addition to satisfying such requirements as may be established through the application process and
incorporated in its franchise agreement including, but not limited to, those pertaining to public, educational and governmental access facilities, every
franchisee shall comply with the conditions set forth in this section, except as prohibited by federal law.
B. Full Service To Village Buildings: A franchisee shall, on request of the village, install, at no charge, at least one service outlet at all municipal buildings
and all primary and secondary education public and private schools within the franchise area, and shall install and charge only its reasonable costs for
any additional service outlets requested for such locations, so long as such additional installations will not interfere with the quality and operation of the
franchisee's system or signal thereon, and the quality and manner of installation of such additional outlets shall have been approved by the franchisee
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and shall comply with all local, state and federal laws and regulations. The franchisee shall provide
basic cable service and expanded basic cable service to all outlets in such buildings free of charge. A franchise may specify other requirements
regarding the availability of facilities for municipal use.
C. Cable Channels For Commercial Use, Local Commercial Television Signals, And Noncommercial Educational Television: A franchisee shall designate
channel capacity for commercial and noncommercial use by persons unaffiliated with the franchisee as required by federal law, consistent with the
principle of fairness and equal accessibility to all persons and the village to the extent they have a legitimate use for such capacity.
D. Technical Standards:
1. Any cable system within the village shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 CFR section 76.601 et seq., and any other applicable
federal technical standards, including any such reasonable standards as hereafter may be amended or adopted by the board of trustees in a manner
consistent with federal law.
2. A franchisee shall use equipment generally used in high quality, reliable, modern systems of similar design, including, but not limited to, backup
power supplies at the fiber nodes and headends capable of providing power to the system for a minimum of two (2) hours in the event of an electrical
outage, plus adequate portable generators to cover longer outages. The obligation to provide backup power supplies requires the franchisee to
install equipment that will: a) cut in automatically on failure of commercial utility AC power; b) revert automatically to commercial power when it is
restored; and c) prevent the standby power source from powering a "dead" utility line. In addition, the design and construction of a system shall
include modulators, antennas, amplifiers, and other electronics that permit and are capable of passing through the signal received at the headend
with minimal alteration or deterioration.

3. The board of trustees may in writing grant reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or rescind its request to interconnect upon its own initiative
or upon petition by the franchisee to the board of trustees. The board of trustees shall rescind the request if it finds that the franchisee has negotiated
in good faith and the cost of interconnection would cause an unreasonable increase in subscriber rates.
4. No interconnection shall take place without prior written approval of the board of trustees. A franchisee seeking approval for interconnection shall
demonstrate that all signals to be interconnected will comply with FCC technical standards for all classes of signals and will result in no more than a
low level of distortion.
5. The franchisee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection authority or state or federal regulatory agency which
may be established for the purpose of regulating, facilitating, financing or otherwise providing for the interconnection of communications systems
beyond the boundaries of the village.

G. Retention Of Records; Relation To Privacy Rights: Each franchisee shall take all steps required, if any, to ensure that it is able to provide the village all
information which must be provided or may be reasonably requested under this chapter or a franchise agreement, including by providing appropriate
subscriber privacy notices. Nothing in this section shall be read to require a franchisee to violate 47 USC section 551. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)

3-6-10: CONSUMER PROTECTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVISIONS:
A. Telephone And Office Availability:
1. Each franchisee shall maintain an office at a convenient location to subscribers, not necessarily within the franchise area, that shall be open during
normal business hours to allow subscribers to request service, pay bills, and conduct other business. Each franchisee shall perform service calls,
installations, and disconnects at least during normal business hours; provided, that a franchisee shall respond to outages twenty four (24) hours a
day, seven (7) days a week. Outage reports should be addressed within twenty four (24) hours. Each franchisee shall establish a publicly listed local
toll-free telephone number. The phone must be answered by customer service representatives at least during normal business hours for the purpose
of receiving requests for service, inquiries, and complaints from subscribers; after those hours, a franchisee shall arrange for the phone to be
answered so that customers can register complaints and report service problems on a twenty four (24) hour per day, seven (7) day per week basis,
and so that the franchisee can respond to service outages as required herein.
2. Under normal operating conditions, telephone answering time shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds or four (4) rings, and the time to transfer the call to
a customer service representative (including hold time) shall not exceed an additional thirty (30) seconds. Under normal operating conditions, a
customer will receive a busy signal less than three percent (3%) of the time. These standards shall be met ninety percent (90%) of the time,
measured quarterly. When the business office is closed, an answering machine or service capable of receiving and recording service complaints and
inquiries shall be employed. The after-hours answering service shall comply with the same telephone answer time standard set forth in this section.
Upon request by the village, franchisee shall supply information demonstrating that it is meeting the standards set forth herein.
3. A franchisee must hire sufficient staff so that it can adequately respond to customer inquiries, complaints, and requests for service in its office, over
the phone, and at the subscriber's residence.
B. Scheduling Work:
1. All appointments for service, installation, or disconnection shall be specified by date. Each franchisee shall specify a specific time at which the work
shall be done, or offer a choice of time blocks, which shall not exceed four (4) hours in length, unless the subscriber agrees to a longer period of
time. Franchisee may also, upon request, offer service installation calls outside normal business hours, for the express convenience of the customer.
If at any time an installer or technician believes it impossible to make a scheduled appointment time, an attempt to contact the customer will be made
prior to the time of appointment and the appointment rescheduled at a time convenient to the customer.
2. Subscribers who have experienced two (2) missed appointments due to the fault of a franchisee shall receive installation free of charge if the
appointment was for installation. If an installation was to have been provided free of charge, or for other appointments, the subscriber shall receive a
fifty percent (50%) discount on one month of basic cable service tier or its equivalent.
3. With regard to mobility-limited customers, upon subscriber request, each franchisee shall arrange for pickup and/or replacement of converters or
other franchisee equipment at the subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent (such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer).
4. Under normal operating conditions, requests for service, repair, and maintenance must be acknowledged by a trained customer service
representative within twenty four (24) hours, or prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is earlier. A franchisee shall respond to all other
inquiries (including billing inquiries) within five (5) business days of the inquiry or complaint.
5. Under normal operating conditions, installations made within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the existing distribution system shall be completed within
seven (7) business days after the order is placed. Repairs and maintenance for service interruptions and other customer location repairs must be
completed within twenty four (24) hours, or if it is not possible to be complete such work within twenty four (24) hours, then work must have
commenced within such time period and be diligently continued thereafter until completed. Work on all other requests for service on franchisee's
facilities must be begun by the next business day after notification of the problem, and must be completed within three (3) days from the date of the
initial request, except installation requests; provided, that a franchisee shall complete the work in the shortest time possible where, for reasons
beyond the franchisee's control, the work could not be completed in those time periods even with the exercise of all due diligence; the failure of a
franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall not justify a franchisee's failure to comply with this provision. Except as federal law
permits, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for this service, unless required due to damage caused by a subscriber.
6. Franchisee shall not cancel a service or installation appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day preceding the
appointment.
7. The standards of subsections B4 and B5 of this section shall be met at least ninety five percent (95%) of the time, measured on a quarterly basis.
C. Notice To Subscribers:
1. A franchisee shall provide in writing to each subscriber at the time cable service is installed, and at least annually thereafter, the following
information:
a. Products and services offered;
b. Prices and options for programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other services;
c. Installation and service maintenance policies;
d. Instructions on how to use the cable service;
e. Channel positions of programming carried on the system;
f. Billing and complaint procedures, including the address and telephone number of the local franchise authority's cable office; and
g. Refund and credit procedures.
2. Upon request, copies of the materials specified in subsection C1 of this section shall be provided to the village. Franchisee shall provide all
subscribers and the village at least thirty (30) days' notice of any significant changes in the information required to be provided by this section. Such
notice shall be in writing and by announcement on the system. Franchisee may provide notice of service and rate changes to subscribers using any
reasonable written means at its sole discretion. Franchisee need not provide prior notice of any rate change that is the result of a regulatory fee,
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 102/338
franchise fee, or any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any federal agency, state, or franchising authority on the
transaction between the franchisee and the subscriber.
3. All franchisee promotional materials, announcements, and advertising of residential cable service to subscribers and the general public, where price
information is listed in any manner, shall clearly and accurately disclose price terms. In the case of pay-per-view or pay-per-event programming, all
promotional materials must clearly and accurately disclose price terms, and in the case of telephone orders, a franchisee shall take appropriate steps
to ensure that the customer service representatives clearly and accurately disclose price terms to potential customers in advance of taking the order.
4. Each franchisee shall maintain a public file containing all notices provided to subscribers under these customer service standards, as well as all
written promotional offers made to subscribers.
D. Interruptions Of Service: A franchisee may intentionally interrupt service on the cable system only for good cause and for the shortest time possible
and, except in emergency situations, only after a minimum of forty eight (48) hours' prior notice to subscribers and the village of the anticipated service
interruption; provided, however, that planned maintenance that occurs between the hours of twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight and six o'clock (6:00) A.M.
shall not require such notice to subscribers, so long as notice to the village is given no less than twenty four (24) hours prior to such an anticipated
service interruption.
E. Billing:
1. A franchisee's first billing statement after a new installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit.
2. A franchisee's billing statement must be clear, concise and understandable, must itemize each category of service and equipment provided to the
subscriber and must state clearly the charge therefor.
3. A franchisee's billing statement must be mailed on or before the first day of the month (or equivalent period) and must show a specific payment due
date not earlier than the fifteenth day of the month (or equivalent period) in which the service being billed is rendered. Any balance not received
within fifteen (15) days after the due date may be assessed a reasonable processing charge based on costs and/or a late fee. Late fees shall not
exceed 0.75 percent per month.
4. A franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit payment in person at the franchisee's office(s) and inform the subscriber of the
address of the office(s).
5. Subscribers shall not be charged a processing fee or late fee or be otherwise penalized for any failure by a franchisee, including failure to timely or
correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made.
6. On request, the account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated share of the monthly charge for the service if said subscriber is without
service or if service is substantially impaired for any reason for a period exceeding four (4) hours during any twenty four (24) hour period, except
where it can be documented that a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or impairment which that subscriber caused, or in the case of a planned
outage occurring between the hours of twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight and six o'clock (6:00) A.M., of which the village received the required prior
notice.
7. Franchisee shall respond to all written billing complaints from subscribers within thirty (30) days.
8. Refund checks to subscribers shall be issued no later than: a) the subscriber's next billing cycle following resolution of the refund request; or b) the
date of return of all equipment to franchisee, if service has been terminated.
9. Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle after the determination that the credit is warranted.
F. Disconnection/Downgrades:
1. A subscriber may terminate service at any time.
2. A franchisee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any subscriber who so requests by giving at least one day notice and reasonably cooperating
with the franchisee regarding the removal of the franchisee's equipment from the subscriber's location. No charge may be imposed for any voluntary
disconnection, and downgrade charges must comply with the requirements of federal law. No charge may be imposed by any franchisee for any
cable service delivered after the requested date of disconnection.
3. A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect a franchisee's equipment and return it to the nearest business office.
4. Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after the equipment has been recovered by
the franchisee. The refund process shall take a maximum of thirty (30) days from the date disconnection was requested to the date the customer
receives the refund.
5. If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber or other fee or charge, a franchisee may disconnect the subscriber's service outlet; however, such
disconnection shall not be effected until after thirty (30) days from the due date. If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before
the date scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect service. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all
fees or charges due, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, and any reasonable security deposit, the franchisee shall promptly
reinstate service on request.
6. A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or destroying the franchisee's cable system or equipment. After
disconnection, the franchisee shall restore service after the subscriber provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the practices that led to
disconnection and paid all proper fees and charges, including any reconnect fees and amounts owed the franchisee for damage to its cable system
or equipment and any reasonable security deposit.
7. A franchisee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal leakage in excess of federal limits. It may do so without notice; provided, that the
franchisee shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber.
8. Except as federal law may otherwise provide, a franchisee may remove its property from a subscriber's premises within sixty (60) days of the
termination of service, voluntarily or involuntarily. If a franchisee fails to remove its property in that period, the property shall be deemed abandoned.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 103/338
G. Changes In Service:
1. Before a franchisee unilaterally alters the service it provides to a class of subscribers, it must provide the village and each affected subscriber thirty
(30) days' written notice by any reasonable means, at its sole discretion, explain the substance and full effect of the alteration, and provide the
subscriber the right within the thirty (30) day period following notice to opt to receive any combination of services offered by franchisee. Except as
federal law otherwise provides, subscribers may not be required to pay any charge (other than the regular service fee), including an upgrade or
downgrade charge, in order to receive the services selected. No charge may be made for any service or product that the subscriber has not
affirmatively indicated it wishes to receive. Payment of the regular monthly bill does not in and of itself constitute such an affirmative indication.
2. If a franchisee plans to provide a premium channel without charge to subscribers who do not subscribe to such premium channel, the franchisee
shall, not later than thirty (30) days before such premium channel is provided without charge, notify all subscribers in writing by any reasonable
means, at its sole discretion, of its plans, including the time period involved, notify all subscribers they have a right to request that the premium
channel be blocked, and block the premium channel upon the request of a subscriber. For purposes of this section, the phrase "premium channel"
shall mean any pay service offered on a per-channel or per-program basis which offers movies rated by the motion picture association of America as
X, NC-17, or R.
H. Deposits: A franchisee may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory deposit on equipment provided to subscribers. Deposits shall be placed in an
interest-bearing account, and the franchisee shall return the deposit upon return of the equipment, plus interest earned to the date repayment is made
to the subscriber, less any deduction for damages to the equipment or unpaid charges.
I. Subscriber Control: A franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws regarding subscriber ability to block audio and/or video signals. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-
1996)
3-6-11: RATE REGULATIONS:
A. The village reserves the right to regulate service and equipment rates to the maximum degree permitted by applicable state and federal law. Each
franchisee shall comply with all such regulatory provisions that the village may adopt and all federal laws regarding rates. Failure to comply shall
constitute a material violation of a franchise. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
B. The village will follow the FCC rate regulations in its regulation of the basic service rates and charges of the company and any other cable television
system operating in the village notwithstanding any different or inconsistent provisions in the franchise. In connection with such regulation, the village
will ensure a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties. The mayor is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the
village and file with the FCC such certification forms or other instruments as are now or may hereafter be required by the FCC rate regulations in order
to enable the village to regulate basic service rates and charges. (Ord. 93-28, 12-14-1993)
3-6-12: FRANCHISE FEE:
A. Finding: The village finds that public rights of way of the village to be used by a franchisee or any other person for the provision of cable service over a
cable system are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the village at great expense to taxpayers. The village further finds that the grant
of a franchise to use public rights of way is a valuable property right without which a franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital.
B. Payment To Village: As compensation for use of the public rights of way, a franchisee and any other person providing cable service over a cable system
shall pay the village franchise fees. Every franchise agreement shall specify the amounts a franchisee is initially required to pay as a percentage of
gross revenues, but if the specified amount is less than the maximum or if the maximum amount permitted increases, the village may increase it to any
amount up to the maximum allowed by law after sixty (60) days' notice to the franchisee, so long as the increase may by law be passed on to
subscribers.
C. Not A Tax Or In Lieu Of Any Other Tax Or Fee:
1. The franchise fee is not a tax, license or fee subject to any requirement of voter approval, but rather is a rental charge for special and individualized
use of public property.
2. The franchise fee is in addition to all other fees and all taxes and payments that a franchisee or other person may be required to pay under any
federal, state, or local law, including any applicable property and amusement taxes, except to the extent that such fees, taxes, or assessments are a
franchise fee under 47 USC section 542.
D. Payments:
1. The franchise fees and any other costs or penalties assessed by the village against a franchisee or any other person shall be paid quarterly to the
village and shall commence as of the effective date of a franchise. The village shall be furnished at the time of each payment with a statement
certified by the franchisee's or other person's respective chief financial officer or an independent certified public accountant reflecting the total
amount of gross revenues for the payment period. Payments shall be made to the village no later than thirty (30) days following the end of each
calendar quarter.
2. In the event any franchise fee or other payment is not made on or before the date specified herein, the franchisee and any other person shall pay
interest charges computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the village's primary depository bank
during the period such unpaid amount is owed, plus two percent (2%) of the amount due to defray the village's additional expenses by reason of the
delinquency.
E. No Accord Or Satisfaction: No acceptance of any payment by the village shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the
village may have for further or additional sums payable as franchise fees under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of a
franchisee or other person.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 104/338
F. Audit:
1. The Village shall have the right to inspect all reasonably necessary records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under this chapter. The franchisee shall be responsible for providing the records to the village at an office located within the county. Such
records shall be maintained for at least five (5) years. The village's audit expenses shall be borne by the franchisee if the franchise fees paid during
the audit period are less than ninety eight percent (98%) of the amount owed according to the audit. Any additional amounts due to the village as a
result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the franchisee by the village of the underpayment, which notice shall
include a copy of the audit report. If recomputation results in additional revenue to be paid to the village, such amount shall be subject to interest as
specified in subsection D2 of this section. All costs incurred by a franchisee hereunder are not franchise fees and fall within one or more of the
exceptions set forth in 47 USC section 542(g)(2) and shall not be passed on to the subscribers in any form.
2. A franchisee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records and have all relevant fiscal and financial records maintained by others on its behalf in such
a manner as to enable the village to determine the cost of assets of the franchisee which are used in providing services within the village and to
determine gross revenues.
3. A franchisee shall report on a quarterly basis to the village clerk the name and address of each and every person providing telecommunications and
other communications services over the cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received by the franchisee, as well as
all such services being provided by the franchisee in addition to cable services unless franchisee already has a separate written franchise or license
from the village to provide such other services. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-13: INSURANCE; SURETY; INDEMNIFICATION:
A. Insurance Required:
1. A franchisee shall maintain and, by its acceptance of a franchise, specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the entire length of the franchise
period, at least the following liability insurance coverage insuring the village and the franchisee: worker's compensation and employer liability
insurance to meet all requirements of Illinois law and comprehensive general liability insurance with respect to the construction, operation, and
maintenance of the cable system, and the conduct of the franchisee's business in the village, in the minimum amounts of:
a. One million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for property damage resulting from any one accident;
b. Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for personal bodily injury or death resulting from any one accident; and
c. Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for all other types of liability.
2. These insurance requirements shall not be construed to limit the liability of a franchisee for damages under any franchise issued hereunder.
B. Qualifications Of Sureties: All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business in the state, with a B+7 or better rating of insurance by
"Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition", and in a form approved by the village.
C. Policies Available For Review: All insurance policies shall be available for review by the village, and a franchisee shall keep on file with the village
certificates of insurance.
D. Additional Insureds; Prior Notice Of Policy Cancellation: All general liability insurance policies shall name the village, its officers, boards, board
members, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees as additional insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in
coverage shall not be effective unless thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof has been given to the village clerk. A franchisee shall not cancel any
required insurance policy without submission of proof that the franchisee has obtained alternative insurance reasonably satisfactory to the board of
trustees which complies with this chapter.
E. Failure Constitutes Material Violation: Failure to comply with the insurance requirements set forth in this section shall constitute a material violation of a
franchise.
F. Indemnification:
1. A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the village, its officials, boards, board members, commissions,
commissioners, agents, and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments for damages or equitable
relief arising out of the construction, maintenance, or operation of its cable system; copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure
consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be delivered by the cable system; the conduct of the franchisee's
business in the village; or in any way arising out of the granting of a franchise or a franchisee's enjoyment or exercise of a franchise granted
hereunder, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this chapter or a franchise agreement.
2. Specifically, but not by way of limitation on the scope of subsection F1 of this section, a franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the village, and in their capacity as such, the officers, agents, and employees thereof, from and against any and all
claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments for damages or otherwise subject to section 638 of the cable act, 47 USC section 558, arising out of or
alleged to arise out of the installation, construction, operation, or maintenance of its system including, but not limited to, any claim against the
franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name,
service mark, or patent, or of any other similar right of any person. This indemnity does not apply to programming carried on any channel set aside
for public, educational, or government use, or channels leased pursuant to 47 USC section 532, unless the franchisee was in any respect engaged in
determining the editorial content of the program, or prescreened the programming for the purported purpose of banning or regulating indecent or
obscene programming.
3. The indemnity provision includes, but is not limited to, the village's reasonable attorney fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or
proceeding prior to franchisee assuming such defense. The village shall notify a franchisee of claims and suits as soon as practicable, but failure to
give such notice shall not relieve a franchisee of its obligations hereunder. Once a franchisee assumes such defense, the village may at its option
continue to participate in the defense at its own expense.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 105/338
4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, the village shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any amounts
attributable to the village's own negligence, wilful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts, including in the performance of its obligations under this
chapter or a franchise agreement. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
3-6-14: PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES AND REMEDIES:
A. Security Fund:
1. Prior to a franchise becoming effective and on each anniversary date thereafter during the franchise term, including the date of termination, the
franchisee shall post with the village clerk sufficient funds to serve as a cash security deposit to be used as a security fund to ensure the franchisee's
faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this chapter, the franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance with all
orders, permits, and directions of the village, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the village which arise by
reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system. The amount of the security fund on deposit shall be equal to three percent (3%)
of the franchisee's projected annual gross revenues for the upcoming year, or in the instance of the final deposit, three percent (3%) of the actual
gross revenues for the preceding year.
2. In lieu of a cash security fund, a franchisee may file and maintain with the village clerk an irrevocable letter of credit with a surety acceptable to the
village in the amount specified in the subsection A1 of this section to serve the same purposes as set forth therein. Said letter of credit shall remain in
effect for the full term of the franchise plus an additional six (6) months thereafter, or longer if there is any outstanding obligation or default on the part
of the franchisee, as determined by the board of trustees. The franchisee and its surety shall be jointly and severally liable under the terms of the
letter of credit for the franchisee's failure to ensure its faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this chapter, the franchise
agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance with all orders, permits, and directions of the village, and the payment by the franchisee of any
claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the village which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system. The letter of credit
shall provide for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the village of any intention on the part of the franchisee to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise
materially alter its terms. Neither the filing of a letter of credit with the village, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the village thereunder,
shall be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by the franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under the terms of its franchise for
damages, either to the full amount of the letter of credit or otherwise.
3. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this chapter or
authorized by other law or a franchise agreement, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund or letter of
credit will affect any other right the village may have.
4. The following procedures shall apply to drawing on the security fund and letter of credit:
a. If the franchisee fails to make timely payment to the village of any amount due as a result of a franchise, fails to make timely payment to the village
of any amounts due under a franchise agreement or applicable law, fails to make timely payment to the village of any taxes due, or fails to
compensate the village within ten (10) days of written notification that such compensation is due for any damages, costs, or expenses the village
suffers or incurs by reason of any act or omission of the franchisee in connection with its franchise agreement or the enforcement of its franchise
agreement, the village may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security fund or from funds available under the
letter of credit.
b. Within three (3) days of a withdrawal from the security fund or under the letter of credit, the village shall mail, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, written notification of the amount, date, and purpose of such withdrawal to the franchisee.
c. If at the time of a withdrawal from the security fund and under the letter of credit by the village, the amounts available are insufficient to provide the
total payment towards which the withdrawal is directed, the balance of such payment shall continue as the obligation of the franchisee to the
village until it is paid.
d. No later than thirty (30) days after mailing of notification to the franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a withdrawal under the
security fund or letter of credit, the franchisee shall deliver to the village for deposit in the security fund an amount equal to the amount so
withdrawn or shall restore the letter of credit. Failure to make timely delivery of such amount to the village or to restore the letter of credit shall
constitute a material violation of the franchise.
e. Upon termination of the franchise under conditions other than those stipulating forfeiture of the security fund, the balance then remaining in the
security fund shall be withdrawn by the village and paid to the franchisee within six (6) months of such termination; provided, that there is then no
outstanding obligation or default on the part of the franchisee.
5. In addition to or in lieu of a security fund or letter of credit, a franchise may require such guarantees as the village deems to be in the public interest.
B. Performance Bond:
1. Prior to any cable system construction, upgrade, or other such work in the public rights of way, a franchisee shall establish in the village's favor a
performance bond to ensure the franchisee's faithful performance of the construction, upgrade, or other work. The amount of such performance bond
shall be equal to ten percent (10%) of the total cost of the work unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement.
2. In the event a franchisee subject to such a performance bond fails to complete the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public
rights of way in a safe, timely, and competent manner, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, there shall be recoverable, jointly and
severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the village as a result, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee, or the cost of completing or repairing the
system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights of way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney fees, up to the full amount of the
bond. The village may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a security fund where such amount exceeds that available
under a security fund.
3. Upon completion of the system construction, upgrade, or other such work in the public rights of way and payment of all construction obligations of
the cable system to the satisfaction of the board of trustees, the board of trustees shall eliminate the bond after a time appropriate to determine
whether the work performed was satisfactory, which time shall be established considering the nature of the work performed.
4. The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with a B+7 or better rating of insurance in "Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition",
shall be subject to the approval of the village attorney, and shall contain the following endorsement:

This bond may not be cancelled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty (60) days after receipt by the village, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew.
C. Failure Constitutes Material Violation: Failure to maintain a required security fund, letter of credit, or performance bond shall constitute a material
violation of a franchise.
D. Remedies: In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the village may apply any one or a combination of the following remedies in the
event a franchisee violates this chapter, its franchise agreement, other applicable ordinances, or applicable state or federal law:
1. Revoke the franchise or shorten the term pursuant to the procedures specified in this chapter.
2. Impose penalties available under subsection H of this section and other applicable state and local laws for violation of village ordinances.
3. In addition to or instead of any other remedy, seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
4. Apply any remedy provided for in a franchise agreement, including enforcing provisions, if any.
E. Shortening, Revocation, Or Termination Of Franchise:
1. The village shall have the right to shorten the term of a franchise to a term not less than thirty one (31) months from the date of the action shortening
the franchise term, or to revoke the franchise, for a franchisee's substantial and ongoing failure to construct, operate, or maintain the cable system as
required by this chapter or a franchise agreement; for defrauding or attempting to defraud the village or subscribers; if the franchisee is declared
bankrupt; or for any other substantial and ongoing material violation of this chapter or substantial and ongoing material violation of a franchise
agreement. To invoke the provisions of this section, the board of trustees shall give the franchisee written notice of such intent. If within thirty (30)
calendar days following such written notice from the village to the franchisee, the franchisee has not completed corrective action or corrective action
is not being actively and expeditiously pursued to the satisfaction of the board of trustees, the board of trustees may give written notice to the
franchisee of its decision to commence a proceeding to consider shortening the term of or revoking the franchise, stating its reasons; provided, that
no opportunity to cure shall be afforded in the event the franchisee is declared bankrupt. Revocation for bankruptcy shall be governed by subsection
E3 of this section.
2. Prior to shortening the term of or revoking a franchise, the board of trustees shall hold a public hearing, after giving at least fifteen (15) calendar
days' notice by posting and publication, at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the public
hearing, the board of trustees may determine whether to shorten the franchise term or to revoke the franchise based on the information presented at
the hearing, and other information of record. If the board of trustees determines to shorten a franchise term or revoke a franchise, it shall make such
decision by ordinance setting forth the reasons for its decision. The village may make such decision conditional on a franchisee's failure to resolve
outstanding problems or take appropriate steps to resolve such problems within a specific period of time. A copy of such decision shall be provided
to the franchisee.
3. Any franchise may, at the option of the board of trustees following a public hearing, be revoked by ordinance one hundred twenty (120) calendar
days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether
in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one hundred
twenty (120) day period:
a. Such assignment, receivership, or trusteeship has been vacated; or
b. Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the existing franchise agreement and has
executed an agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
chapter and the existing franchise agreement.
c. In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of a material portion of the facilities, equipment, or property of a franchisee (other than pursuant to
a pledge or mortgage which qualified as an exception to the definition of a "franchise transfer" and after which the franchise transfer was ultimately
approved), the board of trustees may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the board of trustees, by serving notice on the
franchisee and the successful bidder, in which event, the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate
thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless:
(1) The board of trustees has approved the franchise transfer; and
(2) The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the village to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise
agreement and this chapter.
4. If the board of trustees revokes a franchise, if a franchise expires, or if for any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or
maintain service to its subscribers after notice and reasonable opportunity to cure of at least thirty (30) days, the following procedures and rights are
effective:
a. The board of trustees may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former
franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the board of trustees may have the removal done at the former franchisee's or surety's
expense. In removing its plant, structures, and equipment, the franchisee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it
and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as prevailed prior to the franchisee's removal of its equipment and appliances
without affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires, or attachments. The village shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and
public places, and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance as provided herein shall continue in
full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by the franchisee with the terms and conditions of this subsection E4a
and this chapter. In the event of a failure by the franchisee to complete any such work or any other work required by village law or ordinance within
the time as may be established and to the reasonable satisfaction of the village, the village may cause such work to be done and the franchisee
shall reimburse the village the reasonable cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs.
b. At the expiration of the term for which any franchise is granted (if renewal is either not sought or denied), the village, at its election, shall have the
right to purchase and take over all or any part of a cable system located within the village upon the payment to the franchisee of a sum equal to the
fair market value of the system or the part taken (based on system value as a going concern). In the event of revocation, as provided for in this
chapter, the village, at its election, shall have the right to purchase and take over all or any part of a cable system located within the village upon
payment to franchisee of a sum equal to an equitable price for the system or the part taken. If the village elects to purchase only a part of the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 107/338
system, the fair market value shall include both the fair market value of the part purchased together with the diminution in value of the part not
purchased. The price for the cable system or the part taken shall not include, and the franchisee shall not receive, anything for the value allocated
to the franchise itself unless such valuation is now or subsequently provided for by the cable act or in the franchise itself. Upon the exercise of the
option by the village and its service of an official notice of such action upon the franchisee, the franchisee shall immediately transfer to the village
possession and title to all of the purchased facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable system, with any existing liens and
encumbrances (provided the village can require application of purchase price to such liens and encumbrances at closing); and the franchisee shall
execute such warranty deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the village as shall be reasonably necessary for this purpose. Each contract
entered into by franchisee with reference to its operations under the franchise shall be subject to the exercise of this option by the village.
c. If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee during the franchise term, or if the franchisee fails to operate its system in accordance with this
chapter during any transition period, or the franchisee otherwise terminates the franchise, upon decision of the board of trustees made after
providing the franchisee reasonable notice of at least thirty (30) days and an opportunity to be heard, the ownership of all portions of the cable
system in public rights of way shall revert to the village, and the village may sell, assign, or transfer all or part of the assets of the system, or the
board of trustees, at its option, may operate the system, designate another entity to operate the system temporarily until the franchisee restores
service under conditions acceptable to the village or until the franchise is revoked and a new franchisee selected by the village is providing service,
seek an injunction requiring the franchisee to continue operations, and/or seek to recover all damages sustained as a result of such abandonment
or failure to operate. A franchisee retains all rights to contest such actions and all rights to compensation provided by law. A franchisee shall be
deemed to have abandoned its system or failed to operate its system during any transition period if:
(1) The franchisee fails to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial portion of the cable system for ninety six (96)
consecutive hours, unless the board of trustees authorizes a longer interruption of service in writing; or
(2) The franchisee, for any period, wilfully and without cause refuses to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial
portion of the cable system.
5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, where the village has issued a franchise requiring the completion of construction, system
upgrade, or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, or to comply with such
other specific obligations as may be required, within such time limits, as same shall be extended by the board of trustees for good cause shown by
the franchisee, will result in the forfeiture of the franchise upon decision of the board of trustees made after providing the franchisee with reasonable
notice of at least thirty (30) days and an opportunity to be heard.
F. Remedies Cumulative: All remedies under this chapter and the franchise agreement are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of
one remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of penalties relieve a franchisee of its obligations to
comply with its franchise. Remedies may be used alone or in combination as permitted by law; in addition, the village may exercise any rights it has at
law or equity.
G. Relation To Insurance And Indemnity Requirements: Recovery by the village of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond, a security fund or
letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a franchisee's duty to indemnify the village in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a franchisee of its
obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the village, or in any respect prevent the village from exercising any other right or remedy it
may have. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
H. Penalties: For violation of provisions of this chapter, subject to judicial procedures, penalties shall be chargeable to the franchisee as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996; amd. 2001 Code)

Code)
2. A franchisee shall not unreasonably discriminate among similarly situated persons or take any retaliatory action against a person because of that
person's exercise of any right it may have under federal, state, or local law, nor may the franchisee require a person to waive such rights as a
condition of providing service.
3. A franchisee shall not deny access to cable service or levy different rates and charges on any group of potential residential cable subscribers
because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.
4. A franchisee is prohibited from unreasonably discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential
subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional
discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of
subscribers throughout the village; and a franchisee may offer reasonable discounts for senior citizens or the economically disadvantaged, discounts
or customer specific pricing for bulk rate customers, and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts
are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, and all
executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)
B. Equal Employment Opportunity: A franchisee shall not refuse to employ, discharge from employment, or discriminate against any person in
compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital
status, or age. A franchisee shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunities, as the same
may be from time to time amended including, but not limited to, 47 USC section 554. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996; amd. 2001 Code)
C. Subscriber Privacy: A franchisee shall at all times abide by and protect the privacy of all subscribers pursuant to the provisions of section 631 of the
cable act, 47 USC section 551. A franchisee shall not condition subscriber service on the subscriber's grant of permission to disclose information
which, pursuant to federal or state law, cannot be disclosed without the subscriber's explicit consent. (Ord. 96-31, 10-8-1996)

such noncompliance; provided, that the franchisee takes prompt and diligent steps to bring itself back into compliance and to comply as soon as
reasonably possible under the circumstances with its franchise without unduly endangering the health, safety, and integrity of the franchisee's
employees or property, or the health, safety, and integrity of the public, public rights of way, public property, or private property.
F. Public Emergency: In the event of a public emergency or disaster as determined by the village, acting through such officials as may be available given
the emergency conditions, a franchisee immediately shall make the cable system, employees, and property, as may be reasonably necessary,
available for use by the village or other civil defense or governmental agency designated by the village for the term of such emergency or disaster for
emergency purposes. In the event of such use, a franchisee shall waive any claim that such use by the village constitutes a use of eminent domain;

administrative hearing in accordance with the provisions of this section.
H. Administrative Hearing: At the time a motor vehicle is seized, removed or impounded or within five (5) business days after a motor vehicle is seized,
removed and impounded by order or direction of a police officer of the village of Glen Carbon, the village of Glen Carbon shall notify by personal
service or by certified mail the owner or owners of record of the owner's right to request an administrative hearing to challenge whether violation of this
chapter has occurred or to contest the administrative fee imposed in connection with the seizure or impoundment of the motor vehicle. The owner of
record or his or her attorney seeking a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the office of the chief of police of the village of Glen Carbon
no later than ten (10) business days after the aforesaid notice was mailed or personally served, whichever first occurred. Upon the request of a
hearing, in writing filed with the office of the chief of police of the village of Glen Carbon within the aforesaid time allowed, a hearing date must be
scheduled no more than twenty (20) business days thereafter. The person seeking a hearing shall have the burden of proof establishing that a request
for an administrative hearing was timely filed with the office of the chief of police. Any interested person shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. The hearing may be
continued once commenced to a subsequent time and date certain. The chief of police shall serve as a hearing officer, or he may designate another
individual to serve as a hearing officer on a case by case basis. No person involved in the particular seizure, removal or impoundment decision or
process may serve as a hearing officer.
If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence presented that the motor vehicle was properly subject to
seizure, removal and impoundment by order of a member of the village of Glen Carbon police department, then the hearing officer shall enter a written
order finding the owner or owners of record of the respective motor vehicle civilly liable to the village of Glen Carbon for the applicable administrative
fee as provided by this chapter.
If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle was properly subject to seizure
and impoundment by order of a member of the village of Glen Carbon police department, then the hearing officer shall enter a written finding for the
record owner and grant such relief as may be appropriate, including waiver of all or a portion of the administrative fee and the return of the motor
vehicle to the record owner.
If the owner or owners of record request a hearing but fail to appear at the hearing, or if the owner or owners of record fail to request a hearing in
writing in a timely manner, the owner or owners of record shall be deemed to have waived his or her rights to an administrative hearing and the hearing
officer may enter a default order in favor of the village of Glen Carbon in the amount of the appropriate administrative fee.
The owner or owners of record may elect to pay the administrative fee deemed necessary to redeem the motor vehicle without constituting a waiver of
the right of the owner or owners of record to request an administrative hearing in writing and in a timely manner as provided by this chapter and upon
payment of the appropriate administrative fee, together with any towing and storage fees incurred, the motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner or
owners of record without further bond. The action of the Glen Carbon police department shall be subject to administrative review as provided herein.
The final written decision of the village of Glen Carbon police chief or his designated hearing officer shall constitute a final administrative order and be
subject to judicial review under the provisions of the administrative review act of the state of Illinois.

works or stream.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 157/338
Population Equivalent: A term used to evaluate the impact of industrial or other waste on a treatment works or stream. One population
equivalent is 100 gallons (380 l) of sewage per day, containing 0.17 pounds (77 g) of BOD5 (5 day biochemical oxygen demand) and 0.20 pounds
(91 g) of suspended solids. The impact of a treatment works is evaluated as the equivalent of the highest of the three parameters. Impact on a
stream is the higher of the BOD5 and suspended solids parameters.
b. State of Illinois rules and regulations title 35, subtitle c, part 370, design standards for sewage works, appendices A and B, contain resident
occupancy criteria and commonly used quantities of sewage flows for various types of facilities. If the type of facility to be connected is not listed,
documentation from similar type facilities will be used to determine wastewater population equivalent (PE). This criterion will be used to calculate
the tap-on fees for each permit as furnished with the IEPA application for the construction permit for users with greater than one thousand five
hundred (1,500) gallons per day wastewater discharges to the sanitary sewer system. (Ord. 2000-15, 3-14-2000)
c. Tap-on fees based on population equivalents (PE) are based on the chart below, effective May 1, 2013.
PE Rate
1 - 10 $2,725.00
11 - 20 3,275.00
21 - 100 5,775.00
101 - 500 8,275.00
501 - 999 9,775.00
C. Sewer Service Rates: The net rate for wastewater collection and treatment services, in addition to other fees and charges provided in this chapter is as

convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare. It is not intended by this title to interfere with or abrogate or annul any ordinances, rules,
regulations or permits previously adopted or issued, and not in conflict with any of the provisions of this title, or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant
to law relating to the use of buildings or premises and likewise not in conflict with this title, nor is it intended by this title to interfere with or abrogate or
annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; except, that if this title imposes a greater restriction, this title shall control. (Ord.
96-21, 9-10-1996)
10-1-4: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
Except as may be provided otherwise by statute or ordinance, no official, board member, agent, or employee of the village shall render himself or herself
personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his or her duties

ARTICLE B. ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES
10-9B-1: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
A. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens
of the village, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses
within the village. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
B. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the village board of trustees, and on findings related in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American
Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Erie v. Pap-92s A.M., TDA-93 Kandyland-94, 529 U.S.
277 (2000), City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 121 S. Ct. 1223 (2001), Northend Cinema, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 90 Wash.2d 709 (1978), City
of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002), Barnes v. Glen Theatre Inc., 501 U.S. 560, and studies in "Report To The American
Center For Law And Justice On The Secondary Impact Of Sex Oriented Business", Environmental Research Group, March 31, 1996, "Report Of The
Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Business", Hubert H. Humphrey, III, attorney general for the state of
Minnesota, June 6, 1989, and "Appendix D. Summaries Of Secondary Effects Reports", preface to the second edition, community defense counsel, the
village board of trustees finds:
1. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on
their premises.
2. Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types
of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
3. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
4. Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
5. Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
6. At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis,
gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections.
7. Since 1981, and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test.
8. The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
9. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
10. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part,
because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and
maintain those facilities.
11. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films.
12. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
13. Reasonable zoning and licensing procedures are appropriate mechanisms to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the
operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such procedures will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented
business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the village. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
14. The general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this article.
15. The findings noted in subsections B1 through B14 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.
16. The findings and opinions of the cases and studies as related in the opening of this subsection B are the findings of the village board of trustees as
if set forth verbatim herein. (Ord. 2007-17, 7-24-2007)

A. Purpose And Intent:
1. The purpose of this section is to ensure that an adequate, safe and convenient arrangement of pedestrian circulation facilities, roadways, driveways,
off-street parking and loading spaces are provided on every site requiring site plan approval. Such roads, pedestrian walks and off-street parking and
loading facilities shall be designed as an integral part of an overall site design and shall be properly related to existing and proposed buildings and
appropriate landscaping. Parking facilities shall be landscaped and screened to the extent necessary to eliminate unsightliness and monotony of
large concentrations of parked cars. Parking facilities shall be designed with careful regard to orderly arrangement, topography, landscaping, and
ease of access and shall be developed as an integral part of an overall site design. Any aboveground loading facility shall be screened from public
view to the extent necessary to eliminate unsightliness.
2. Off-street parking spaces shall be required for all uses in all zoning districts. Off-street loading facilities shall be provided as required by subsection H
of this section. Within this chapter, references to parking facilities include parking lots and parking garages.
B. Procedure: Every site plan application for the construction or improvement of a parking and/or loading facility shall include therewith a concept
landscape plan, drawn to scale, showing any off-street parking or loading facilities and related site improvements and landscaping.
C. Increased Or Decreased Parking Demand:
1. Increased Parking Demand: When any building, structure or site undergoes a change of use or any increase in the number of dwelling units, floor
area, seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified hereinafter as a means for determining required off-street parking or loading facilities,
and when such a change or increase would, through application of the provisions of these standards thereto, result in a requirement for greater total
off-street parking and/or loading spaces, such off-street parking and/or loading facilities shall be increased to equal or exceed the off-street parking
and loading requirements resulting from application of the provisions of these standards to the entire building, structure or site as modified in use or
capacity.
2. Decreased Parking Demand: When a building, structure or site undergoes a decrease in the number of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity or
other unit of measurement specified hereinafter as a means for determining required off-street parking and loading facilities, or when the application
of the standards herein would result in a requirement for fewer total off-street parking and/or loading spaces than are provided on the subject site, the
available off-street parking and/or loading facilities may be so reduced accordingly; provided, that existing off-street parking and loading remaining
would equal or exceed the off-street parking and loading requirements resulting from application of the provisions of these standards to the entire
building, structure or site as modified.
D. General Provisions:
1. Repair, Service Or Sales Use Of Parking Facilities Prohibited: No required off-street parking or loading facilities shall be utilized for motor vehicle
repair work, service, display or sales of any kind, except as expressly permitted elsewhere in this title.

and zoning commission by site plan approval in accordance with this chapter in order to ensure the smooth and safe circulation of vehicles to and
from the public street system. The number of entrances and exits shall be limited to one entrance and one exit or one combined entrance and exit
per three hundred (300) linear feet of street frontage unless additional entrances and/or exits are deemed necessary by the planning and zoning
commission. Except for single-family residential dwellings and duplexes, all parking access shall be designed to prevent the need to back directly
onto a public road or right of way.
4. Location Of Parking And Loading Spaces: All required off-street parking or loading spaces shall be provided on the same parcel of land occupied by
the use or building to which it is appurtenant; provided, however, that where there are, in the judgment of the planning and zoning commission,
practical difficulties in satisfying the requirement for parking space and/or if the public safety or convenience would be better served by another
location, the planning and zoning commission may authorize an alternative location for any portion of the required parking for a nonresidential use
which will adequately serve the public interest, subject to the following conditions:
a. Required accessory off-street parking facilities may be provided elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is located and shall
not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total parking required; provided, that the property occupied as parking is in the same possession, either by
deed, by easement, or by long-term lease which has a term equal to or exceeding the projected life of the facility occupied by the principal use;
and further provided, that the owner shall be bound by covenants filed on record in the office of the county recorder of deeds, requiring the owner
and his or her heirs and assigns, as well as subsequent owners, heirs or assigns, to maintain the required number of off-street parking spaces
during the existence of such principal use.

may, with fifteen (15) days' prior written notice, be rescinded by the village board of trustees, and additional parking shall be obtained by the
owners in the event that the village board of trustees determines that such joint use is resulting in a public nuisance or is otherwise adversely
affecting the public health, safety or welfare.
d. Land uses which do not meet the criteria of subsection D5 of this section but which can clearly demonstrate the ability to successfully provide joint
parking facilities to the satisfaction of the planning and zoning commission may be permitted to share up to fifty percent (50%) of their required
parking spaces; provided, that written agreement assuring the retention for such purpose shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties
concerned, approved as to form and execution by the village attorney, and shall be filed and made part of the application for a building permit.
Such approval may, with fifteen (15) days' prior written notice, be rescinded by the village board of trustees, and additional parking shall be

activities, except to the extent that existing bicycle parking exceeds such requirement for any existing facilities. The required amount of new bicycle
parking shall be provided at a minimum of two (2) bicycle parking spaces for each commercial use.
2. Standards For Required Bicycle Parking And Types Of Required Bicycle Parking:
a. Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall consist of a bicycle rack or racks and is meant to accommodate visitors, customers, messengers, and others

10-13-2: SITE PLAN REVIEW:
A. Applicability Of Provisions:
1. Applicable Zoning Districts: An approved site plan is required in the A-1, RS-10, RT and RM districts for the development or redevelopment of any
parcel of land proposed for any land use except single-family dwellings, uses customarily accessory to a single-family dwelling and agricultural uses
which do not involve additional impervious surfaces. All proposed developments in the MED, CN, CG, CM, IL and OP districts shall be required to
submit a site plan. The purpose of the site plan review procedures is to enable the village to consider potential impacts upon the area in the vicinity of
the property, consistency with good planning practices, and to ensure high standards of site and building design for the general welfare of the village
and its residents.
2. Types Of Site Plans:
a. Site plans shall be divided between major and minor site plans.
(1) Major site plans shall follow the procedures outlined in this section. A "major site plan" is defined as a plan for the development of a parcel of
land that contains no buildings or for which the existing buildings are to be removed and a new building or buildings constructed. In addition, a
major site plan shall be required for any development that is adding more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of new impermeable surface to
a site. A major site plan must be approved by the planning and zoning commission.
(2) "Minor site plans" shall be defined as plans for the expansion, change in use, or redevelopment of a site that already contains a building or
buildings and shall not consist of any development which adds more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of new impermeable surface to a
site. A minor site plan may be approved by the building and zoning administrator if it meets all of the requirements of this title.
b. Within this section, references to site plans include requirements for both major and minor site plans. Requirements that deal specifically with
major site plans or minor site plans are so indicated.
c. The procedure for obtaining approval of a major site plan includes: 1) the filing of an application with the site plan; 2) the review and comments by
village departments; 3) review of the site plan and comments from village departments by the planning and zoning commission; and 4) approval of
the site plan by the planning and zoning commission.
3. Relationship To Other Ordinance Requirements: The requirements, procedures and standards contained in this section are in addition to the
requirements, procedures and standards contained in other sections of this title which shall remain applicable to the parcel for which the application
is filed. In case of conflict between the general provisions and district regulations of this title with provisions of this section, the more restrictive
requirement shall control.
B. Application, Review And Approval Of Site Plan:
1. Application:
a. An applicant shall confer with the building and zoning administrator, or the administrator's designee, to become familiar with the village's
regulations and requirements affecting the district in which the parcel in question lies and shall obtain copies of all provisions of the village
ordinances pertaining to procedures and requirements for site plan approval.
b. An application may be made by the owner or by any person with a contractual interest in the property. Written consent of the owner shall be
required if the applicant is not the owner. All owners must join if more than one.
c. The written application for review and approval of the site plan shall be filed on a form supplied by the building and zoning administrator and shall
be accompanied by a site plan as described in subsection C of this section. The application shall be signed by the applicant and shall state the
name and address of the applicant and of the owner. If the applicant is not the owner, the application shall identify the applicant's specific
contractual interest in the property. A fee for reviewing the site plan shall be paid to the village at the time of filing the application.
2. Review Of Application:
a. Upon receipt of an application completed in satisfactory form, the building and zoning administrator shall deliver a copy of the application and
accompanying papers, including the site plan, to the appropriate village departments for their review and comments on the impact of the proposed
development on health, safety, traffic, public services or facilities and other relevant considerations, in both the area of the project, and other areas
of the village which may be affected. Such comments shall be sent to the building and zoning administrator and forwarded to the applicant within
twenty one (21) days of the receipt of the completed application.
b. Within twenty one (21) days from the forwarding of comments to the applicant, the applicant shall advise the building and zoning administrator of
the applicant's desire to revise the application and site plan based on the village's comments or proceed to a review by the planning and zoning
commission if the application is for a major site plan. If the applicant opts to proceed to a review of the major site plan by the planning and zoning
commission, the application shall be placed on the agenda of the next available meeting of the commission. If the applicant opts to revise the
major site plan, the previously outlined review periods will be repeated.
3. Major Site Plan Approval: The planning and zoning commission shall review the major site plan at a regular meeting, and the major site plan shall be
approved, disapproved, or approved with conditions. In determining whether to approve, disapprove, or approve the major site plan with conditions,
the planning and zoning commission shall consider:
a. All relevant information, including the comments of village officials, the major site plan's consistency with good planning practices, its compatibility
with adjacent developments and uses, and its effect on the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents of the area in the vicinity of
the property subject to the major site plan and upon the residents of the village generally.
b. The likely effect of the major site plan on vehicular or pedestrian traffic, fire hazards, fire, police and utility services, municipal expenditures,
surface water drainage and control facilities and environmental aspects.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 248/338
4. Minor Site Plan Approval, Disapproval And Appeal: The building and zoning administrator may approve a minor site plan if the site plan complies
with all requirements of this title. If the building and zoning administrator denies approval of a minor site plan, including the provision of written
comments as to the reason for such denial, the denial may be appealed by the applicant to the planning and zoning commission for review. The
planning and zoning commission shall then approve the minor site plan, approve the minor site plan with conditions, or deny the site plan.
5. Validity Of Site Plan: Approval of a site plan shall be valid for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of approval by the village. If no building
permit is obtained during that period, the approval shall terminate. The planning and zoning commission may grant extensions of time not to exceed
twelve (12) months each, upon written request of the applicant for a substantially similar major site plan; provided, that the request is filed prior to the
expiration date. The planning and zoning commission may attach new conditions when an extension is granted. If, in the opinion of the planning and
zoning commission, the application contains substantial changes to the originally approved plan, a new major site plan review process must occur
including the payment of a new application fee. The same procedure shall be followed by the building and zoning administrator for minor site plans.

are located, it shall include a schedule for bringing into conformance, within three (3) years, all signs not conforming to the proposed amended plan or
to the requirements of the ordinance in effect on the date of submission.
J. Binding Effect: After approval of a common signage plan, no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such
plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this title. In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan and
any other provision of this title, this title shall control. (Ord. 2019-06, 1-22-2019)
10-15-16: AUTOMOBILE SERVICE STATIONS:
This section is intended to apply to all zoning districts where an automobile service station exists or is permitted. This section is intended to allow a

feet in gross sign area except, that the total gross sign area per street frontage may increase by twelve and one-half (12.5) square feet for each fifty
feet (50') an individual business or use is set back from the edge of street pavement up to a maximum of one hundred twenty five (125) square feet
in area, provided said individual business or use has the required street frontage to accommodate such an increase. The content of this sign shall be
limited to the name of the firm, the business being conducted on the premises, or the principal product being offered for sale on the premises, or a
combination of same. A business logo may appear as a part of this wall sign.
2. Additional Wall Signs: In instances where the incidental washing of motor vehicles is an accessory service being offered on a property used for an
automobile service station, one additional wall sign shall be permitted. This wall sign shall not exceed ten (10) square feet in area. The content of this
sign shall be limited to the product being offered for sale on the premises. One sign designating the entrance to and one sign designating the exit
from the washing area shall be affixed directly to the structure near such entrance or exit. The gross sign area of such signs shall not exceed twelve

or other symbols, may appear on this canopy sign as part of the gross sign area allowable for said sign.
4. Pump Signs: Signs shall be allowed on gasoline pumps so as to provide the required information to the public regarding "octane rating", "price", and
"type of fuel". As the trade name of the business is often incorporated into the different types of fuels, said trade name and any associated symbols
shall be permitted on the sides of the pumps as flat signs located no more than three feet (3') above the ground and not to exceed two (2) square
feet in area per sign face (4 square feet in aggregate) per pump. "Self-service" or "full-service" signs shall identify each pump island on the service

10-15-17: VARIANCES:
A. Standards For Variance:
1. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this chapter, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may vary or modify the application of specific regulations for any permitted form of signage so that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
2. A variance from this chapter may be granted for any permitted form of signage where it is found that because of the limitations on character, size,
number, or dimensions of signs, or the regulations controlling the erection or installation of a sign, the applicant would be subject to practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardship. Unnecessary hardship is not considered the loss of possible advantage, economic loss or gain, or mere

may not be located within buffer zones determined by the village, county or state.

11-1-7: INTERPRETATION; SEVERABILITY:
A. Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion
of the public health, safety, and general welfare. These regulations shall be construed broadly to promote the purposes for which they are adopted.
1. Public Provisions: These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other
provision of law except as provided in these regulations. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed
by any other provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, the provision which is more restrictive
or imposes higher standards shall control.
2. Private Provisions: These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction; provided,
that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other
private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall govern.
B. Severability: The phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this title are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, or
section of this title shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful by the valid judgment, decree, or injunction order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, such ruling shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this title. In the event that,
contrary to the policies, interests, and values of the village, a court of competent jurisdiction issues a judgment, decree, or injunction order that this title,
or any part thereof, is unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful because of any omission or prohibition in this title, then all provisions of this title not
specifically declared to be unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that judgment, decree, or injunction
order declaring all or a portion of this title to be unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful is reversed or vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
provisions contained in this title shall remain in full force and effect. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-1-8: SAVING PROVISION:
These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or as
waiving any right of the village under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights

obtained by any person, firm, or corporation by lawful action of the village, except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-
13-2012)
11-1-9: AMENDMENTS:
A. Initiation And Filing Amendment: Amendments to these regulations may be proposed by the building and zoning administrator, any member of the
board of trustees, any planning and zoning commission member, or any party in interest. Every amendment proposal shall be filed on a prescribed form
in the building and zoning administrator's office. The building and zoning administrator shall promptly transmit each proposal, together with any
comments or recommendations he may wish to make, to the village planning and zoning commission for a public hearing.
B. Public Hearing: The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on every amendment proposal within a reasonable time after said
proposal is submitted to them. At the hearing any interested party may appear and testify, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney.
Notice indicating the time, date, and place of the hearing, and the nature of the proposed amendment shall be given not more than thirty (30) and not
less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within Glen Carbon.
C. Advisory Report; Action By Board Of Trustees: Within ninety (90) days after the public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall submit an
advisory report to the board of trustees. The board of trustees shall act on the proposed amendment at their next regularly scheduled meeting following
submission of this report. Without another public hearing, the board of trustees may either pass or reject the proposed amendment or may refer it back
to the planning and zoning commission for further consideration. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-1-10: DUTY TO COMPLY WITH PROVISIONS:
Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated by the
state to the village. The subdivider/developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the board of trustees for design,
dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land to conform to the physical and economic development of the village and to the health, safety, and
general welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-1-11: VARIANCES:
A. Application For Variance: Any subdivider/developer desiring a variance from the requirements of this title shall file a written application therefor with the
building and zoning administrator at the same time that he files his preliminary plat. The application shall fully explain the grounds for the variance
request, and specify the sections of this title which, if strictly applied, would cause great practical difficulties or hardship.
B. Advisory Report: The building and zoning administrator shall prepare an advisory report on every variance application and submit it, together with the
completed application, to the planning and zoning commission.
C. Review By Planning And Zoning Commission: The planning and zoning commission shall review the variance application and the building and zoning
administrator's comments, perform on site review when appropriate, and submit their advisory report as part of the staff report submitted to the village
board of trustees together with their recommendation on preliminary plat approval. The planning and zoning commission's advisory report shall be
responsive to all the variance standards set forth in subsection D of this section.
D. Action By Board Of Trustees; Variance Standards: At the same meeting at which they take action on the application for preliminary plat approval, the
board of trustees shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny the requested subdivision variance. A copy of their decision, clearly stating their
reasons therefor and the exact terms of any variance granted, shall be attached to both the preliminary and final plats. The board of trustees shall not
grant any subdivision variance unless, based upon the information presented to them, they determine that:
1. The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of these regulations; and
2. Strict application of the subdivision requirements would result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, not a mere inconvenience;
and
3. The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the subdivision requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship; and
4. The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of his own making; and
5. The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not applicable to other tracts, and a variance would be a more appropriate remedy
than an ordinance amendment; and
6. The variance, if granted, will not materially interfere with implementation of the Glen Carbon comprehensive plan including the official map.
E. Conditions Of Variance: In approving variances, exceptions, or waivers of conditions, the Board of Trustees may require such conditions as will, in its
judgment, secure substantially the purposes described in section 11-1-3 of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-1-12: ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
A. Enforcement Officials: It shall be the duty of the Building and Zoning Administrator and Director of Public Works to enforce these requirements and to
bring to the attention of the Village Attorney or designee any violations of these regulations. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)

A. Classification Of Subdivisions: Before any land is subdivided, the owner of the property proposed to be subdivided, or his authorized agent, shall apply
for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedures, which include two (2) principal steps for a minor
subdivision, and two (2) principal steps for a major subdivision:
1. Minor subdivision:
a. Approval by building and zoning administrator.
b. Final plat.
2. Major subdivision:
a. Preliminary plat approval.
b. Final plat.
B. Subdivision Process: All preliminary plats for major subdivisions shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for review and
recommendation, then shall be reviewed by the board of trustees. The planning and zoning commission's review shall conclude with a
recommendation for approval, recommendation for approval with conditions, or recommendation for disapproval.

D. Coordination Of Flexible Zoning Application With Subdivision Approval:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 285/338
1. Intent: It is the intent of these regulations that subdivision review be carried out simultaneously with the review of flexible zoning applications under
the zoning ordinance. The plans required for flexible zoning applications shall be submitted in a form to satisfy the requirements of this title.
2. General Requirement: Whenever the zoning ordinance authorizes flexible zoning applications which permit density of buildings and structures
different from those which are allowed as of right within the zoning district in which the land is situated, and the application entails the division of land
into two (2) or more lots, subdivision approval shall be required in addition to all other procedures and approvals required in the zoning ordinance.
Flexible zoning applications shall include, but not be limited to, all special uses and planned development procedures, and shall apply to all such
applications, whether before the board of trustees, board of zoning appeals, planning and zoning commission or an administrative officer.
3. Procedure To Be Followed:
a. Preliminary Plat Approval Required: Whenever a flexible zoning application is submitted which involves a subdivision of land as set forth in
subsection D2 of this section, the application shall be submitted first to the official authorized to accept the application under the zoning ordinance.
The application shall be made on the forms required for a plat and shall include all information required of a preliminary plat application. The
building and zoning administrator shall then refer the application to the planning and zoning commission for preliminary plat review. The planning
and zoning commission shall also, when applicable under the provisions of the zoning ordinance, make such reviews of use, density, and bulk
standards as are required under the flexible zoning regulation. The preliminary plat shall then be forwarded to the board of trustees for review and
approval.
b. Referral Back For Zoning Approval: After completing its review, the planning and zoning commission shall refer the preliminary plat with its
recommendation of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval, together with such recommendations and reviews of use, density, and bulk
standards as it was required to make under the flexible zoning regulation of the zoning ordinance, to the appropriate body or official, as indicated in
the zoning ordinance. Application shall then be made to the planning and zoning commission for final plat review. The final plat then will be
forwarded to the board of trustees for review and final approval. No building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued for the project until
the zoning application has been finally approved and the final plat is recorded with the county recorder of deeds.
4. Resubdivisions Of Flexible Zoning Developments:
a. A flexible zoning development or land use plan may be subdivided or resubdivided for purposes of sale or lease after the project plan has been
finally approved and development completed or partially completed.
b. If the subdivision or resubdivision of a flexible zoning development will create a new lot line, the applicant shall make application to the planning
and zoning commission for review of the subdivision or resubdivision. The planning and zoning commission shall recommend approval of the
subdivision to the board of trustees only if an amended zoning application also is approved for the flexible development plan, by the appropriate
body or official as indicated in the zoning ordinance, for all provisions governing use, density, and bulk standards. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-3-2: MINOR SUBDIVISION1:
If a preliminary plat constitutes a minor subdivision, the building and zoning administrator shall review the plat, approve it, disapprove it or conditionally
approve it within thirty (30) days from the date of submission of a complete application and plat. Subsequent to an approval or conditional approval by the
building and zoning administrator, the applicant may proceed directly to the filing of an application for approval of a final plat as provided in these
regulations. If the preliminary plat of a minor subdivision is disapproved by the building and zoning administrator, the applicant may appeal to the board of
trustees as provided in subsection 11-3-4F of this chapter. The applicant shall have one year from the date that the preliminary plat is approved by the
building and zoning administrator (or board of trustees upon appeal) to submit a final plat, after which time a new preliminary plat must be submitted for
approval. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-3-3: PRELIMINARY PLAT CONCEPT PLAN:
A. General Procedure: Before preparing a proposed plat for an area, the owner, developer, or their representative should have a preapplication meeting
with the building and zoning department and public works department to determine applicable ordinance regulations and standards which must be
addressed. After the preapplication meeting(s), the subdivider should then prepare a concept plan for the proposed subdivision. The concept plan shall
be submitted to the building and zoning department. After concept plan review the subdivider should then prepare the preliminary plat or plan, as
defined in this subdivision control ordinance. The preliminary plat cannot be considered as filed until all required data is submitted. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-
2012)
11-3-4: PRELIMINARY PLAT (MAJOR AND MINOR):
A. Application Procedure And Requirements: Following the approval of the preliminary plat concept plan, the applicant, if he wishes to proceed with the
subdivision, shall file with the building and zoning administrator an application for approval of a preliminary subdivision plat. The application shall:
1. Except as specifically provided otherwise below, every person who proposes to subdivide any land located within the subdivision jurisdiction of this
municipality shall file sixteen (16) copies of the preliminary plat of said subdivision with the building and zoning department.
2. Whenever a tract is to be developed in stages and only a portion of that tract is to be submitted for final plat approval, nonetheless, a preliminary plat
or plan of the entire tract shall be submitted. All preliminary plats shall be reviewed and acted upon in accordance with Illinois statutes.
3. Be made on forms available at the office of the building and zoning administrator, together with a fee as set by the board of trustees.
4. Include all land which the applicant proposes to subdivide and all land immediately adjacent, extending one hundred feet (100') from the subject
property, or of that directly opposite the subject property, extending one hundred feet (100') from the street frontage of land opposite, with the names

acceptance by the Board of Trustees of the dedication of the last completed public improvement. The applicant (subdivider) shall promptly correct all
deficiencies occurring in the improvements in the subdivision during the two (2) year warranty period. The subdivision improvement guarantee shall
contain such other terms and conditions agreed to by the applicant and the Board of Trustees.
2. Covenants To Run With Land: The subdivision improvement shall provide that the covenants shall run with the land and bind all successors, heirs,
and assignees of the subdivider.
3. Security: The applicant shall provide a letter of credit or cash escrow as security for the subdivision improvements. Either security shall be in an
amount equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements, including lot
improvements. The issuer of the letter of credit or the escrow agent, as applicable, shall be acceptable to the Village Treasurer.
a. Letter Of Credit: If the applicant posts a letter of credit as security for its promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the credit
shall: 1) be irrevocable; 2) be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods in subsection B1 of this section; and
3) require only that the government present the credit with a sight draft and an affidavit signed by the Village Attorney attesting to the Village's right
to draw funds under the credit and be from a bank approved of and insured by the FDIC designating the Village of Glen Carbon as beneficiary.
b. Cash Escrow: If the applicant posts a cash escrow as security for its promises contained in the subdivision improvement plans, the escrow
instructions shall provide: 1) that the subdivider will have no right to a return of any of the funds except as provided in subsection C3 of this
section; and 2) that the escrow agent shall have legal duty to deliver the funds to the Village whenever the Village Attorney presents an affidavit to
the agent attesting to the Village's right to receive funds whether or not the subdivider protests that right. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015)
C. Release Or Reduction Of Security:
1. Certificate Of Satisfactory Completion: The Board of Trustees will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce the
amount of any security posted by the subdivider until the Public Works Director or his designee has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until:
a. The applicant's licensed professional engineer or surveyor has certified to the Public Works Director or his designee, through submission of a
detailed as built survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the Public Works
Director or his designee, that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements are in accordance with construction plans for the
subdivision; and
b. A title insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the Village Attorney indicating that the improvements have been completed, are
ready for dedication to the Village, and are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. Upon such approval and recommendation by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, Public Works Director or his designee, and Village Attorney, the Board of Trustees shall thereafter accept the
improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
2. Submittal Of As Built Drawings: Upon satisfactory submission, review and approval of as built drawings, the developer's engineer shall provide the
Village with as built drawings in an electronic computer aided drafting (CAD) format acceptable to the Village.
3. Reduction Of Escrowed Funds And Security: If the security posted by the subdivider was a cash escrow, the amount of that escrow shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which
dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall a cash escrow be reduced below twenty
five percent (25%) of the principal amount. Funds held in the escrow account shall not be released to the subdivider, in whole or in part, except upon
express written instructions of the Village Attorney. At the end of the maintenance and warranty periods, all escrowed funds, if any, shall be released
to the subdivider. If the security provided by the subdivider was a letter of credit, the Village Attorney shall execute waivers of the Village's right to
draw funds under the credit upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public
improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall waivers be
executed that would reduce the security below twenty five percent (25%) of its original amount.
D. Temporary Improvement: The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the Board of Trustees and shall
maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by the Board of Trustees. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or
improvement, the developer shall file with the Village a separate subdivision improvement plan and a letter of credit or cash escrow in an appropriate
amount for temporary facilities, which agreement and credit or escrow shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained,
and removed.
E. Costs Of Improvements: All required improvements shall be made by the developer, at its expense, without reimbursement by the Village.

F. Resolution Or Ordinance By Governmental Units: Governmental units to which these contract and security provisions apply may file, in lieu of the
contract and security, a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the
provisions of this chapter.
G. Failure To Complete Improvements: In those cases where a subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and
required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the agreement, the Village may then: 1) declare the agreement to be in
default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the agreement is declared to
be in default; 2) suspend final plat approval until the improvements are completed and record a document to that effect for the purpose of public notice;
3) obtain funds under the security and complete improvements itself or through a third party; 4) assign its right to receive funds under the security to
any third party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that
subsequent owner's promise to complete improvements in the subdivision; 5) exercise any other rights available under the law.
H. Acceptance Of Dedication Offers: Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance of the
Board of Trustees. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. Maintenance
requirements associated with Federal, State, and local laws or permits shall be appropriately noted on the plat.
I. Defective Improvements:
1. If at any time prior to final inspection and release of the maintenance security, as provided in subsection C3 of this section, the improvements are
found by inspection to be defective, they shall be repaired or replaced at the subdivider's expense to the satisfaction of the Village. The Village shall
have their option to either cause the improvements to be repaired or replaced and charge the costs thereof to the subdivider or to make demand
upon the subdivider to cause the improvements to be repaired or replaced at the subdivider's expense. If the subdivider fails to pay costs or make
repairs or replacements within sixty (60) days after demand is made upon the subdivider by the Village or other governmental entity, the
maintenance security shall be sued to make the required repairs or replacements. If the costs of the repairs or replacements exceed the amount of
security, the subdividers shall be personally liable for said excess costs.
2. Further, the excess costs shall constitute a lien on all unsold lots in the subdivision and no building permits shall be issued until all defects are
corrected to the satisfaction of the Village. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015)
11-4-2: INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:
The subdivider/developer shall notify the Director of Public Works not less than one week in advance of both the start and completion of construction.

construction and provide to the Public Works Director a statement that all public improvements are in compliance with this Code.
B. Public Works Department Inspection: The Public Works Department shall inspect said improvements and review on site reports by the consulting
engineer while improvements are under construction. If the Director determines that improvements are being built in violation of this Code, he shall
immediately notify the subdivider/developer. The subdivider/developer shall stop work and correct the deficiencies before resuming additional
construction.
C. Compliance With Code Verified Before Acceptance: The Public Works Department or its consultant shall inspect improvements during construction and
upon completion. The Village shall not accept any completed improvement until the Public Works Director or their consultant has stated in writing that it
complies with this Code.
D. Subdivider Responsible For Construction: The Director of Public Works is not responsible for direction of the subdivider/developer's construction work
or that of his contractors. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
11-4-3: ESCROW DEPOSITS FOR LOT IMPROVEMENTS:
A. Acceptance Of Escrow Funds: Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvements required by the subdivision regulations cannot be
performed, the Building and Zoning Administrator may issue a certificate of occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety or general welfare,
upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the Public Works Director or his designee for the cost of the lot
improvements. The subdivision improvement agreement and security covering the lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect. (Ord. 2015-17,
4-14-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
B. Procedures On Escrow Fund: All required improvements for which escrow monies have been accepted by the Building and Zoning Administrator at the
time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the subdivider within a period of nine (9) months from the date of deposit and
issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If the improvements have not been properly installed at the end of the time period, the Building and Zoning
Administrator shall give two (2) weeks' written notice to the developer requiring it to install the improvements, and if they are not then installed properly,
the Building and Zoning Administrator may request the Board of Trustees to proceed to contract out the work for the installation of the necessary
improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow
monies are being deposited with the Building and Zoning Administrator, the developer shall obtain and file with the Building and Zoning Administrator
prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a notarized statement from the purchaser or purchasers of the premises authorizing the Building and
Zoning Administrator to install the improvements at the end of the nine (9) month period if the improvements have not been duly installed by the
subdivider. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015)

The developer shall be required to maintain all required public improvements on the individual subdivided lots, if required by the Public Works Director or
his designee, until acceptance of the improvements by the Board of Trustees. If there are any certificates of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the
Village, the Village may, on twelve (12) hours' notice, plow the street or effect emergency repairs and charge those costs to the developer. Following the
acceptance of the dedication of any public improvement by the Village, the Village may, in its sole discretion, require the subdivider to maintain the
improvement for a period of one year from the date of acceptance. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
11-4-5: DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:
A. The Board of Trustees may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all public improvements
as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of the
inadequacy or nonexistence of connecting facilities. Any determination to defer or waive the provision of any public improvement must be made on the
record, and the reasons for deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record.
B. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Board of Trustees to defer the construction of any improvement required under these regulations because of
incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or nonexistent connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his share of the
costs of the future improvements to the Village prior to signing of the final plat by the President of the Board of Trustees, or the developer may execute
a separate subdivision improvement agreement secured by a letter of credit guaranteeing completion of the deferred improvements upon demand of
the Village. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015)
11-4-6: ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY:

the Village, as required in the Board of Trustees' approval of the final plat, except as provided in this chapter.
B. The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant(s) and by police and fire equipment prior to the
issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall, at the time of the offer of dedication, submit monies in escrow to the Village in a sum required in
this chapter for the necessary final improvement of the street. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for lots where the
provisions of title 12, chapter 1 of this Code have not been met. (Ord. 2015-17, 4-14-2015)
11-4-7: CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATUTES:
A. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or issued if a developer or its authorized agent has violated any Federal, State or local
law pertaining to: 1) consumer protection; or 2) real estate land sales, promotion, or practices; or 3) any applicable conflicts of interest legislation with
respect to the lot or parcel of land which is the subject of the permit or certificate until a court of competent jurisdiction so orders.
B. With respect to any lot or parcel of land described in subsection A of this section, if a building permit or certificate of occupancy has been granted or
issued, it may be revoked by the Village until a court of competent jurisdiction orders otherwise; provided, that in no event shall the rights of intervening
innocent third parties in possession of a certificate of occupancy be prejudiced by any such revocation.
C. Any violation of a Federal, State, or local consumer protection law, including, but not limited to: Postal Reorganization Act of 1970; the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1970; Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act; the Truth in Lending Act; the Uniform Commercial Credit Code; State "Blue Sky"

subject to all of the penalties and proceedings as set forth in section 11-1-12 of this title. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-4-8: VACATION OF PLATS:
In accordance with State law, any plat or part thereof may be vacated by the owner of the tract, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written
vacation instrument to which a copy of the plat is attached. If there are public service facilities in any street, other public way, or easement shown on said
plat, the instrument shall reserve to the Village or other public entity or public utility owning such facilities the property, rights-of-way, and easements
necessary for continuing public service by means of those facilities and for maintaining or reconstructing the same. The vacation instrument shall be
approved by the Village Board in the same manner as the final plats of subdivision and shall also be approved by all persons and agencies as required by
the Plat Act. If utility easements are also to be vacated the representative of the affected utility companies shall also sign, as shall the current owners of all
lots to be vacated. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-4-9: VACATION OF STREETS:

D. The planning/zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed vacation. At least fifteen (15) days prior to such a hearing, notice of time,
place and subject matter shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation. At the hearing, all interested persons shall be heard concerning the
proposed vacation.
E. Within a reasonable time after the hearing, the planning/zoning commission shall submit their advisory report to the village board. The report shall state
the planning/zoning commission's recommendations regarding the vacation and their reasons thereof.
F. The village board may adopt an ordinance providing that it shall become effective when all owners of property abutting upon the street, alley or part
thereof so vacated shall pay compensation in the amount to be determined in the following manner:
1. Determine the most recent equalized assessed value (EAV) of the petitioner's unimproved land abutting the street, alley or part thereof which is to be
vacated.
2. Establish a cost per square foot of the unimproved land by dividing the EAV by the square footage of the petitioner's land.
3. Apply this rate per square foot to the number of square feet to be vacated by the village.
G. If there are any public service facilities in such street, alley or part thereof, the ordinance may also reserve the village or public utilities' rights of way or
easements which are necessary for continuing public service. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)

drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features that will reasonably be harmful to
the health, safety, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or
developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, upon recommendation
of the Public Works Director or designee, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall
not involve any danger to public health, safety, and welfare. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)

11-5-2: LOTS:
A. Lot Arrangement: The building lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions,
in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning ordinance and health regulations and in providing driveway access to
buildings on the lots from an approved street or an existing access easement that was approved prior to the effective date of these regulations. Lot
arrangement shall also consider the requirements of subsections 11-5-9F and G of this chapter concerning bike paths and bike path accessways.
B. Lot Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to
street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large

out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off street parking and loading facilities required for the type of
use and development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance.
C. Lot Orientation:
1. Front Line: The lot line common to the street right-of-way shall be the front line. All lots shall face the front line and a similar line across the street.
Wherever feasible, lots shall be arranged so that the rear line does not abut the side line of an adjacent lot.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 298/338
2. Corner Lots: Corner lots shall be configured to accommodate front yards on each street, and may need to be larger than the minimum lot size to
accommodate such yards and maintain a sufficient building envelope.
3. Flag Lots: The use of flag lots are normally prohibited everywhere in the Village. There may be certain circumstances and instances where the use
of flag lots are required due to physical limitations or other factors out of the control of the developer including wasted or damaging building areas in
areas of environmental sensitivity. Flag lot usage within a subdivision development may be permitted by requesting a variance to the subdivision
control ordinance, following the procedures and requirements listed herein:
a. Variation Procedure And Criteria: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall first determine the following criteria before any flag lots shall be
permitted as an approved lot subdivision method:
(1) Property Values:
(A) Flag lots shall not significantly reduce property values in the neighborhood areas adjoining and within the proposed development. The
Planning and Zoning Commission among other things, shall consider the size of nearby lots in comparison to the proposed flag lots when
considering whether property values have been reduced; and
(2) Physical And Geographical Restraints:
(A) The physical terrain, or the configuration of the land to be subdivided and the location of nonaccessible streets or any combination of the
above, is such that subdivision of said area into standard lots in accordance with regular subdivision standards are not feasible.
(B) Conventional division would result in greater erosion hazard, loss of trees, or other environmental damage which could be prevented by the
use of a flag lot.
The subdivider or their assignee must make application for a variation to permit flag lots within their development on the subdivision application
forms as provided for in the Department of Building and Zoning.
b. Use Of Flag Lots: If flag lots are requested and approved as a variation to the subdivision control ordinance, the following criteria will be utilized as
minimal design standards to permit flag lots within a subdivision development.
(1) Standards And Use: Minimum standards for usage of flag lots:
(A) Minimum lot size is fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet, exclusive of the area of the "flagpole" or "panhandle" with a width at the
established building line of not less than seventy five feet (75') and not less than one hundred feet (100') in average depth.
(B) The minimum panhandle width shall be thirty feet (30') and shall only serve the lot to which it is connected. The entrance to a flag lot may not
be located within five hundred feet (500') of an entrance to another flag lot.
(C) Minimum access paving width of the driveway used for access shall be twelve feet (12'). (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
(D) Driveways and parking areas shall be constructed of at least six inches (6") thick PC concrete driveway pavement, or equal, as approved by
the Public Works Director. Driveway portions of a flag lot must be constructed prior to final plat approval of the subdivision, unless at the
developer's election, money is escrowed for construction of the driveway. No occupancy permit shall be issued without construction of the
driveway to stated standards.
(E) Subbase and base course of driveways and parking areas shall be inspected and be acceptable to the Public Works Director prior to final
surfacing. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
(F) Whether or not the panhandle is used for access, it shall remain free of structures and be available for possible future access to a public
street.
(G) Each rear lot or parcel shall have two (2) unenclosed parking spaces plus at least two (2) enclosed with sufficient turnaround area to
eliminate the necessity for a vehicle to back out onto the street. The parking spaces shall not be located in the panhandle portion of the
driveways.
(H) The lot size, yard areas, dwelling standards, and conditions of use shall be the same for flag lots as for any other lot in a particular zoning
district. (See also subsection C3b(1)(N) of this section.)
(I) If public utility easements are located on the flagpole or panhandle portion of the lot, then the pole portion of the lot shall be a minimum of
thirty five feet (35') in width.

2. Access From Major And Secondary Arterials: Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a major or secondary street. Where driveway
access from a major or secondary street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require that such
lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards on the street. Lots shall be designed and arranged so that
driveways constructed will not require vehicles to back into traffic on arterial streets.
E. Erosion, Sedimentation, Grading, And Seeding:
1. Improvements Plan Compliance: No proposed subdivision/development shall be approved unless the improvements plan indicates compliance with
the principles, standards, and specifications of this subsection. Said principles, standards and specifications shall be applicable during all phases of
any clearing, stripping, excavating, filling, grading, construction, or other activity involving the disturbance of the natural terrain or vegetative ground
cover.
2. General Principles:

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 301/338
a. Roads shall be related appropriately to topography. Local access roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance.
All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many building sites as possible at or above the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall
conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are
contained in the design standards of these regulations.
b. All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on the
official map and the thoroughfare plan map contained in the comprehensive plan.
c. All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping
centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
d. Local access streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to
require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
e. The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern is not recommended for residential areas. The use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped
streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout.
f. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions
or unless, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts of land.
g. In business and industrial developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location
of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
6. Blocks:
a. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.
b. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but block
lengths in residential areas shall not exceed one thousand four hundred feet (1,400'), nor be less than five hundred feet (500') in length. Wherever
practicable, blocks along major arterials and collector streets shall be not less than one thousand feet (1,000') in length.
c. In long blocks, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require the reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities,
drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic.
d. Walkways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet (10') wide, may be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission through the center of blocks
more than eight hundred feet (800') long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation, or other community facilities. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require screening, fencing, or additional setbacks from
such walkways. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the Planning and Zoning
Commission for prospective users.
7. Access To Principal Arterials: Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed principal arterial, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
a. Lots shall back onto the principal arterial and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the principal arterial, and screening
shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots.
b. A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loop streets entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with
the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the principal arterial.
c. A marginal access or service road (separated from the principal arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access at suitable points).
8. Road Names: Road names shall be sufficiently different in sound and spelling from other road names in the Village so as not to cause confusion. A
road which is (or is planned as) a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name. The subdivider/developer shall consult with the County

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 302/338
a. Construction Of Roads: The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when the
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and where the continuation is
in accordance with the Village thoroughfare plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must temporarily be a dead end street, the
right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead end streets, with
the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abuttors whenever the street is continued. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may limit the length of temporary dead end streets in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
b. Dead End Roads (Permanent): Where a road does not extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the
Planning and Zoning Commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than fifty feet (50').
However, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities,
pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead end street with a minimum right-of-way
radius of fifty four feet (54') and a minimum pavement radius of forty three feet (43'). For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead end streets shall be limited in length to a maximum of five hundred feet (500'). (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
13. Alleys: Alleys may be allowed in single-family residential districts only with Planning and Zoning Commission approval. Alleys may be required in
multiple-family districts and in commercial and industrial districts unless other adequate provisions for service access are made. When required or
provided, alleys shall be at least ten feet (10') wide, and shall be paved in accordance with specifications maintained by the Public Works Director or
designee. Alleys normally shall not intersect with one another nor change sharply in alignment and shall be paved in accordance with specifications
maintained by the Public Works Director or designee. Adequate vehicular turnaround space shall be provided at the terminus of any rear end alley.

a. Any private access easement or noncompliant private road existing upon the effective date hereof shall be permitted to continue and be
maintained so as to provide access to the lots served by the private access easement or noncompliant road upon the effective date hereof.
b. No subdivision creating a new lot or parcel which is to be served only by a private access easement or noncompliant private road shall be
permitted after the effective date hereof unless the private access easement or noncompliant private road necessary to serve a lot or parcel to be
created meets the requirement of a private street in effect at the time the proposed subdivision is considered by the Plan Commission. (Ord. 2016-
32, 11-22-2016)
B. Design Standards: In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient
system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for roads are hereby required:
1. Minimum Right-Of-Way And Pavement Widths: Every right-of-way established for subdivision purposes is to be separate and distinct from the lots or
parcels adjoining such right-of-way and not included within the dimensions or areas of such lot or parcels. All rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the
public by the subdivider. The minimum pavement widths shall be as noted in table 5-1 of this section.
2. Excess Right-Of-Way Widths: Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to
topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess of three to one (3:1). (Ord. 2015-18,
4-28-2015)
3. Road Surfacing And Improvements: After sewer and water utilities have been installed by the developer, the developer shall construct curbs and
gutters and shall surface or cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations. All surfacing shall be of a character as is
suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding areas. Types of pavement shall be as determined by
the Public Works Director or designee. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage
improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted by the Public
Works Director or designee or Board of Trustees and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for
plat approval. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
4. Railroads And Limited Access Highways: Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways, where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
a. In residential districts, a buffer strip at least twenty five feet (25') in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the
plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures on this land is prohibited."
b. In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad right-ofway
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance from the railroad right-of-way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
c. When streets parallel to the railroad right-of-way intersect a street which crosses the railroad right-of-way at grade, they shall, to the extent
practicable, be at a distance of at least one hundred fifty feet (150') from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
5. Intersections:
a. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of less
than seventy five degrees (75°) shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be
approximately at right angles for at least one hundred feet (100') therefrom. Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point.
b. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty feet (150') shall not be permitted, except where the
intersected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment
shall be continuous. Intersection of major streets shall be at least eight hundred feet (800') apart.
c. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) local streets shall be at least twenty five feet (25'), and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a collector street shall be at least thirty five feet (35'). Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the
corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement.
d. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall
be provided having not greater than a two percent (2%) rate at a distance of fifty feet (50'), measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 303/338
intersecting street.
e. Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the
extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
f. The cross slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
6. Pavement Structure: All streets and alleys shall be paved across the entire surface width. All streets and alleys shall be paved as indicated below,
with the Village Board of Trustees or the Public Works Director or designee reserving the right to select the most appropriate option; likewise,
equivalents to the minimum street construction standards found in table 5-2 of this section may be approved by the Public Works Director or
designee depending on engineering and traffic volume considerations. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
a. Concrete Designs: Bituminous and/or concrete roadway designs shall be at a minimum based on Illinois Department of Transportation Pavement

(5) Cut sections shall be proof rolled and tested to verify subgrade strength and density. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
(6) Where the bearing strength of subgrade soils is determined to be weak based on boring data, County soils surveys, field observations or test
results, the Public Works Director or designee reserves the right to require pavement designs based on the pavement design procedures for
nonfederal aid local streets as presented in the IDOT Administrative Policy Manual to determine proper subgrade treatment. Such treatment
may include, but is not limited to, lime modification, lime stabilization or removal and replacement of unsuitable materials. Recommendations for
subgrade treatment shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and submitted to the Public Works Director for review. (Ord. 2015-18,
4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
(7) Suitable subgrade/subbase underdrain systems shall be installed at all pavement locations subject to a high water table based on boring data,
County soils surveys, field observations or previous history.
d. Rigid Pavements: Rigid pavements are specified as either reinforced or unreinforced portland cement concrete to be constructed either on the
earth subgrade or on a crushed stone subbase.
(1) Contraction joints are to be provided at the spacing shown in table 5-2 of this section for each of the various alternates. These transverse joints
are to be sawed joints that are one-eighth inch (1/8") to one-fourth inch (1/4") wide with a depth equal to one-fourth (1/4) of the pavement
thickness. Sawed construction joints are to be sawed as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to permit sawing without excessive
raveling, usually four (4) to twenty four (24) hours. All joints shall be sawed to the full depth required before shrinkage cracking takes place, and
if necessary, the sawing operations shall be carried on both during the day and night regardless of weather conditions. All contraction joints are
to be doweled. Dowel sizes and spacing shall comply with the following requirements:
Pavement
Thickness
Min. Dowel
Diameter
Min. Dowel
Length
Min. Dowel
Spacing
8" 3/4" 36" 15"
10" 3/4" 36" 15"
The dowel units are to be smooth, plain and round bars held in position parallel to the surface and centerline of the slab by metal devices that meet
the approval of the director of public works.
A light coating of oil shall be uniformly applied to the bars prior to placing the concrete. The welds in the assembly shall be securely made. A broken
weld will be sufficient cause for the rejection of the length or section of the assembly in which it occurs.
The dowel bar assembly shall be completely assembled before being placed in position. The assembly shall be installed so that the dowel bars are
parallel to the proposed pavement surface and to each other and so that the assembly is at right angles to the centerline of the pavement. All
shipping tie wires shall be cut after the assembly is secured in place.
When the dowel bar assembly is in place on the subgrade or subbase, the assembly shall act as a rigid unit with each component part securely held
in position relative to the other members of the assembly. The entire assembly shall be held securely in place during consolidating and finishing of
the concrete by means of metal stakes which shall penetrate the base at least three hundred millimeters (300 mm) (12 inches).
The contractor shall check the horizontal alignment of the dowel bars by an approved means and the vertical alignment of each dowel bar by means
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 304/338
of a leveling device so constructed that it may be adjusted to the correct grade. Any deviation from correct alignment greater than three millimeters
(3 mm) (1/8 inch) in three hundred millimeters (300 mm) (12 inches) shall be corrected before any concrete is placed.
Care shall be exercised in depositing the concrete at the dowel bar assemblies so that the horizontal and vertical alignment will be retained.
(2) Longitudinal joints shall be constructed no closer than eight feet (8') and no farther apart than twenty feet (20'). The longitudinal joints may be
either "construction" joints or "sawed" joints. In either case, there shall be transverse #4 epoxy coated formed steel tie bars, thirty inches (30")
long, spaced at thirty inch (30") centers along all longitudinal joints. This includes the joint between the pavement and curb/gutter.
(A) Longitudinal "Sawed" Joints: Epoxy coated deformed steel tie bars of specified length, size, spacing and material shall be placed
perpendicular to the longitudinal sawed joints. They shall be firmly supported on support pins, or rigidly supported on approved joint
assemblies to prevent displacement.
Longitudinal sawed joints shall be constructed along the centerline of 7.2 meters (24 feet) wide pavements, and along the lane lines of
pavements 10.8 meters (36 feet) or more in width that are paved full width in a single operation.
Longitudinal sawed joints shall be formed by cutting the surface of the pavement by means of approved concrete saws. These longitudinal
joints are to be sawed joints that are one-eighth inch (1/8") to one-fourth inch (1/4") wide with a depth equal to one-fourth inch (1/4") of the
pavement thickness.
Sawing of the longitudinal joint shall commence as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to permit sawing without excessive
raveling, usually four (4) to twenty four (24) hours. All joints shall be sawed to the full depth as shown on the plans before uncontrolled
shrinkage cracking takes place. If necessary, the sawing operations shall be carried on both during the day and night regardless of weather
conditions.
When multiple land pavement is being placed in more than one operation, all required sawing or longitudinal joints shall be performed on the
pavement in place before additional lanes are constructed. Sawing of a longitudinal joint shall be continuous across all transverse joints.
Whenever sawing is discontinued, the cut shall terminate at a transverse joint. Water supply equipment for the sawing operations may be
permitted on the pavement provided individual axle loads do not exceed eighteen (18) kN (4,000 pounds) and wheel loads are not applied
within 1.8 meters (6 feet) of the pavement edges.
(B) Longitudinal "Constructed" Joints: When adjacent lanes of pavement are constructed separately, epoxy coated deformed steel tie bars of
specified length, size, spacing and material shall be placed across the longitudinal construction joint to tie the lanes together. The epoxy
coated tie bars shall be installed in preformed or drilled holes along the vertical edge of the first lane placed as specified on the plans. The tie
bars shall be installed with an approved nonshrink grout or chemical adhesive to provide a minimum pull requirement of: 1) thirty five (35) kN
for no. 15 bars (7,750 pounds for no. 5 and 5,000 pounds for no. 4 bars); 2) forty nine (49) kN (11,000 pounds) for no. 20 (no. 6) bars; 3)
eighty eight (88) kN (19,750 pounds) for no. 25 (no. 8) bars. Holes shall be blown clean and dry prior to placing the grout or adhesive. The
installation shall be with methods and tools conforming to the grout or adhesive manufacturer's recommendations.
An alternative method of installing the epoxy coated steel tie bar of specified length, size, spacing and material shall be by use of a header
board drilled to accept the tie bars (using proper dowel diameter and spacing). The header board, with appropriate tie bars, will be in place as
the first lane is poured. The header board will be removed after the first lane concrete has set sufficiently for the tie bar to remain firmly in
place. The tie bars will be placed midway between the top and bottom thickness of the first lane.
All tie bars shall be installed and approved prior to placement of any concrete in the adjacent lane and all tie bars will be tight and secure.
Sawed longitudinal joints shall be sawed within twenty four (24) hours of concrete placement and prior to any traffic or vehicle traveling on the
surface.
(3) Transverse construction joints shall be constructed at the end of each day's run or at locations where a cold joint will occur due to a delay or
interruption in placement operations. All transverse construction joints shall be tied with #6 reformed bars, thirty six inches (36") long, spaced at
twelve inch (12") centers. Construction joints must be at least ten feet (10') from a contraction joint.
(4) Pavement reinforcement shall be used in all rigid pavements designated as SRPCC in table 5-2 of this section. Reinforcement shall be welded
wire fabric (6 inches x 12 inches) with W 4 wire transversely and W 5.5 wire longitudinally weighing approximately fifty four (54) pounds per one
hundred (100) square feet. The fabric shall be lapped twelve inches (12") on transverse laps and six inches (6") on longitudinal laps.
Reinforcement shall be placed on the subgrade and supported by proper wire chairs and spacers, prior to paving, at the heights specified below:
Pavement Thickness
Depth Below
Pavement Surface
8" 21/2" minimum, 31/2" maximum
10" 3" minimum, 4" maximum
e. Techniques: Materials and construction techniques shall be in accordance with the applicable sections of the "Standards And Specifications For
Road And Bridge Construction", latest edition, as published by the Illinois department of transportation.
f. Standards And Specifications: In the event of dispute, Illinois department of transportation standards and specifications shall prevail.
g. Reports: An Illinois licensed professional engineer responsible for the design construction review services for the subdivider/developer shall be
required to certify any pavement design reports, compaction reports, etc., that are required for the improvements.
7. Curb And Gutter:
a. All streets, except alleys, private drives, access easements, arterial or industrial, shall be constructed with portland cement concrete vertical curb
and gutter and/or V-type gutter in accordance with the dimensions and specifications shown in the Village construction specifications, unless
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 305/338
otherwise approved by Village Board of Trustees. Only vertical curb and gutter shall be constructed in industrial or commercial streets.
b. Curb and/or gutter may be constructed either integrally or separately in conjunction with portland cement pavement. If constructed separately, the
gutter flag shall be "tied" to portland cement concrete pavement with thirty inch (30") long no. 4 reinforcing bars spaced at thirty inch (30") centers.
(Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
c. Once a street right-of-way is dedicated to the Village, no person may place or install any structure over or into the curb and gutter portion of any
Village maintained street right-of-way without written permission from the Public Works Director or designee. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015; amd. Ord.
2018-07, 4-24-2018)
C. Road Dedications And Reservations:
1. New Perimeter Streets: Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing
half street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within
its own subdivision boundaries.
2. Widening And Realignment Of Existing Roads: Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the comprehensive plan or official map
indicates plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to
dedicate those areas for widening or realignment of those roads. The costs of improving the realignment or widening of the road may be shared
between the Village and the developer upon determination by the Board of Trustees that the cost of the realignment or widening exceeds the cost of
providing necessary access to the subdivision. Frontage roads shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at their own expense to the full
width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements
of the zoning ordinance whether the land is to be dedicated to the Village in fee simple or an easement is granted to the Village.

11-5-4: DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS2:
A. General Requirements: The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend approval of any plat of subdivision that does not make adequate
provision for storm and flood water runoff channels or basins. The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent of any wastewater
sewer system.
B. Nature Of Stormwater Facilities:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 307/338
1. Location: The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the board of trustees may require the applicant to carry away by pipe or open
ditch any spring, surface water or stormwater runoff that may exist either previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision to protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements
of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with approved construction plans.
2. Accessibility To Public Storm Sewers: The applicant shall be responsible for constructing adequate facilities for the control, collection, conveyance,
acceptable discharge of stormwater, other surface water and subsurface water which may be detrimental to the safe and convenient use of any
portion of the area. The storm drainage system shall provide for runoff from the entire area of the subdivision. It shall take into account land outside
the subdivision limits, which normally drains across the area of the subdivision as well as the effects of the subdivision upon downstream drainage
systems. As primary focus, the drainage system for the subdivision shall make use of, protect, and improve, as needed, the natural drainage system.
Drainage facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards and procedures specified in these regulations. (Ord. 2015-18,
4-28-2015)
3. Accommodation Of Upstream Drainage Areas: A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The subdivider's engineer shall calculate the necessary size
of the facility, based on current engineering standards assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development permitted by the
comprehensive plan or zoning ordinance. Such calculations shall be submitted to the Public Works Director or designee for approval. (Ord. 2015-18,
4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
4. Effect On Downstream Drainage Areas: The flow rate and velocity of postdevelopment stormwater runoff from the site shall not exceed the flow rate
and velocity of predevelopment runoff from the site. Stormwater detention, retention, or other BMP structures shall be designed, constructed, and
maintained to achieve this. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
5. Areas Of Poor Drainage: Whenever a plat is submitted for an area that is subject to flooding, the Board of Trustees may approve such subdivision;
provided the area is located outside of floodway limits, and that the applicant fills the affected area of the subdivision to an elevation sufficient to
place the elevation of streets and lots at a minimum of twelve inches (12") above the elevation of the 100-year floodplain, as determined by the
Public Works Director or designee. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
6. Floodplain Area: The Board of Trustees may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future population of the
area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage, and wastewater facilities, prohibit the development of a subdivision of any portion of the
property that lies within the 100-year floodplain of any stream or drainage course, unless the land elevations are changed to remove or elevate the
land above the 100-year floodplain elevation. These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from
clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste material, or stumps, except at the discretion of the Board of Trustees.
7. Drainage Improvement Plans: Plans must include drainage, streets, and utility locations to be installed in or in conjunction with a subdivision. Overall
stormwater drainage/management plan and an erosion control plan and its impact on contiguous land and source of effluent or discharge are also
required. The developer shall furnish two (2) copies of the stormwater computations sealed by an Illinois licensed professional engineer. The plans
and specifications shall be signed and sealed by the Illinois licensed professional engineer responsible for their preparation. The stormwater
drainage/management plan, associated stormwater system design calculations and the soil erosion control plans shall be submitted to the Madison
County Soil and Water Conservation District for their review. If a development exceeds one acre, a stormwater permit for the proposed development
is required from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The plans must be designed to comply with floodplain regulations, critical infrastructure
requirements and hazardous mitigation regulations.
C. Dedication Of Drainage Easements:
1. General Requirements: When a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width and construction as will be adequate
for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width
for maximum potential volume of flow.
2. Drainage Easements:
a. Perpetual, unobstructed easements at least twenty feet (20') in width for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside road lines
and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall extend from the road to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
b. When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
c. Easements shall also be provided for storm drainage facilities that may need to be installed in the future to serve underdeveloped land within the
watershed that normally drains across the area of a proposed development.
d. The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by a drainage or conservation easement, land on both sides of an existing defined watercourse
having a bed and top of bank to a distance of sixty feet (60') back from the top of bank to the lot line.
e. Low lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall
be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainageways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be utilized for average
density procedures or for computing the area requirement of any lot.
D. Design Criteria: A stormwater management plan shall be required for any new residential, commercial, industrial, institutional or utility subdivision
having a gross aggregate area of one acre or more. The following rules shall govern the design of improvements with respect to managing stormwater
runoff:
1. Design Storm: All storm drainage facilities shall be designed with sufficient capacity and freeboard where necessary to convey the peak rates of
runoff from storms with the average return frequencies listed below:
a. 2-year: All detention/retention basins (in addition to 100-year).
b. 10-year: All drainage facilities within road and easements from catch basins grates to outlet structures. Pavement encroachment, or maximum instreet
spread, for drainage should be designed according to section 1-304.01 of the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual.

c. 25-year: All cross culverts under drives, minor and local streets, as well as improved streams, swales and ditches. Pavement encroachment, or
maximum in-street spread, for drainage should be designed according to section 1-304.01 of the Illinois department of transportation drainage
manual.
d. 50-year: All cross culverts and bridges constructed under residential collector and arterial streets.
e. 100-year: All detention/retention basins and bridges.
(1) The lowest opening elevation in all habitable buildings shall be the 100-year hydraulic grade line (HGL) elevation plus one foot (1').
(2) Drainage ditches, open channels, and natural drainageways shall have zero created head compared with predevelopment conditions at the
upstream property line along said drainageway up to the 100-year flood frequency if any increase in flooding up to the 100-year frequency storm
affects upstream structures or collector roads (or higher category roads), unless the developer acquires permanent flood easements to cover the
area with increased flooding levels up to the 100-year flood event from the parties upstream whose structures and/or roads (collector level or
higher) will experience an increase of flooding.
(3) Drainage ditches, open channels, and natural drainageways which have no potential to increase flooding upstream of structures or collector
roads (or higher category roads) up to the 100-year event, shall not have a created head greater than 0.1 foot at the upstream property line of
the project property along said drainageway unless easements are obtained from the upstream property owner to cover the increases of flooding
up to the 100-year event, or unless there is a storm sewer, culvert, bridge, dam or other drainage structure within two hundred feet (200')
downstream of the upstream property line on said drainageway in which case the created head shall not be greater than 0.5 foot at the upstream
property line of the project property along said drainageway unless easements are obtained from the upstream property owner to cover the
increases of flooding up to the 100-year event.
2. Storm Sewers:
a. Storm sewer systems shall be designed according to chapter 8 of the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual (latest edition). In the
event there is contradictory language between this chapter and the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual (latest edition), the
language of this chapter shall govern.

approximately twenty feet (20') of the pipe constructed at 0.5 percent slope at the outlet and shall have an erosion control system provided.
g. Curb inlet and catch basin spacing shall not exceed a maximum gutter drainage flow distance of two hundred fifty feet (250'). Inlet and basin
spacing shall also be provided as needed to conform IDOT gutter spread requirements.
3. Culverts:
a. Culverts shall be designed according to chapter 6 of the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual (latest edition). In the event there is
contradictory language between this chapter and the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual (latest edition), the language of this
chapter shall govern.
b. The hydrologic methodology for the culverts shall be in accordance with table 4-002 of the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual
(2011 edition).
4. Bridges:
a. Bridges shall be designed according to chapter 7 of the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual (latest edition). In the event there is
contradictory language between this chapter and the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual (latest edition), the language of this
chapter shall govern.
b. The hydrologic methodology for the bridges shall be in accordance with table 4-002 of the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual
(2011 edition).
5. Stormwater Detention: If detention basins are necessary, they must be designed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and currently
accepted engineering design practices. The design submission must include the following:
a. Map showing site, its location within the watershed, and the watershed limits. All detention facilities shall be analyzed with hydrograph and storage
routing techniques.
b. Examination must be made of the routing of stormwater through the site and its flow path as it is discharged from the site. Subdrainage basin limits
within the watershed must be delineated.
c. Designation of the location(s) of the proposed detention basin(s). Provide analysis for the stormwater runoff from those areas tributary to the
proposed detention facility. Existing and proposed conditions must be evaluated. Peak storms with return frequencies for the 2-, 10-, 25-, and 100-
year events shall be analyzed as follows:
(1) For detention basins with drainage areas less than one hundred (100) acres, the engineer shall use the rational method for detention storage
as described in the Illinois department of transportation drainage manual under chapter 4, hydrology and chapter 12, detention storage and as
further defined below:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 309/338
(A) Existing and proposed "C" factors for agricultural, pastures, or wooded areas shall be 0.20 or less unless an extensive survey of soil types
and land slopes is presented to verify that a higher value is justified.
(B) Existing and proposed "C" factors for paved and building areas shall be 0.90 or more. This excludes aggregate surfaces which should be
evaluated based on the condition and slope of the aggregate surface.
(C) Existing and proposed "C" factors for lawns shall be 0.20 or more unless an extensive survey of soil types and land slopes is presented to
verify that a lower value is justified.
(D) For commercial developments, "C" factors for the proposed development shall be calculated by a full tabulation of the proposed surface
areas in the development when known, or by calculating the road "C" factor within the right of way and by calculating a composite "C" factor
based on the maximum allowed coverage (pavement and building area) per lot for the development.
(E) For residential developments, "C" factors for the proposed development shall be calculated by a composite section of the typical road and lot
configuration showing the average amount of paved and building areas per lot, and a full tabulation of the park, other green spaces, and lakes
within the development.
(F) Please note that the engineer may also use one of the unit hydrograph methods as described below for drainage areas under two hundred
(200) acres if they can demonstrate that subwatersheds have significantly nonhomogeneous land use or significantly different subwatershed
timing that effect the proper design of said detention facilities.
(2) For detention basins with drainage areas greater than one hundred (100) acres, the engineer shall use a unit hydrograph routing method that is
generally accepted to the Illinois department of natural resources/office of water resources such as the Clark or TR-20 unit hydrograph
methodologies inside computer programs such as HEC-1 or HEC-HMS or other computer programs accepted by the Illinois department of
natural resources/office of water resources, and as further defined below:
(A) Rainfall data and distributions should be utilized as described in bulletin 70 and circular 173 as published by the Illinois state water survey.
Enough durations of each required frequency must be run to determine the peak storm duration for each frequency.
(B) Time of concentrations may be determined as described in either TR-55 or the IDOT drainage manual. Lag time if utilized may be assumed
to be equal to 0.6 times the time of concentration.
(C) The selected curve numbers or other runoff coefficients must be calibrated to surveys of existing flood frequencies in other local watersheds
which have already been modeled. This information shall be provided to the village. If the engineer does not have calibrated curve numbers
for a similar watershed, the village will provide curve numbers with such a basis.
d. The detention basin may be designed to drain dry or to retain water for extended periods after rain events. All detention/retention basins must be
properly maintained and kept free of algae growth, trash, and other debris.
e. The depth-area-volume relationship of the basin is dependent on the storage volume needed to reduce the peak inflow rate to some desired peak
outflow rate. As the natural contours in the site dictate, ponding depths should be kept as shallow as possible. However, where stormwater storage
depths exceed four feet (4'), a bench width of six feet (6') should be provided around the entire perimeter of the basin (exclusive of bermed areas).
Outlets from normally dry detention basins can take on a number of forms, limited only by safety and maintenance considerations. Outlet pipe
must be at least twelve inches (12") in diameter to facilitate maintenance. If less capacity is required than a twelve inch (12") pipe would provide,
flow should be throttled at the pipe entrance. Trash racks or perforated risers are required at inlets to help guard against plugging of the pipe.
f. The side slope of the basin should be no steeper than four horizontal to one vertical (4:1) for the safety of mechanical mowing equipment and the
safety of people during those times when water is being stored. All grades on the bottom of this basin should be at least two percent (2%) so that
the bottom will drain quickly and leave no wet spots. A low flow concrete channel shall be provided in the basin.
g. An emergency spillway outlet shall be provided for discharge of flows in the event the storage capacity is exceeded or the primary outlet is
nonfunctional. The emergency spillway shall be designed for the 100-year storm frequency event assuming the basin is dry, or at normal pool for a
wet basin, and the primary outlet is nonfunctional (plugged) at the start of the rainfall event.
h. Easements should be included if necessary and access roads provided to allow vehicles and other equipment the access needed for maintenance
of the basin.
i. If detention is to be of the wet basin (retention type), the volume needed for temporary storage must be provided above the normal pond elevation.
j. The outlet structure of wet basins (retention type) must be constructed such that the pond level is maintained. The side slopes beneath the water
surface of the pond should be two horizontal to one vertical (2:1), to a depth of three (3) or four feet (4') to discourage the growth of aquatic plants
unless a wetland system is developed along the shoreline of the pond. If fish are to be stocked in the pond, at least twenty five percent (25%) of
the pond area should be at least ten feet (10') deep.
k. An as built survey of detention basin grades and outlets with an accompanying storage calculation will be required upon completion of the
proposed detention basin. Any completed basin below ninety five percent (95%) of the design storage shall be regraded and reseeded to obtain
the original design storage.
l. Detention dams which meet the criteria as a regulated dam as described in the most recent version of "Rules For Construction And Maintenance
Of Dams" by the Illinois department of natural resources/office of water resources require an IDNR/office of water resources permit prior to village
approval for construction.

11-5-7: SIDEWALKS:
A. Required; Exemption: Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of each street throughout the entire subdivision. Sidewalks are not required for
industrial subdivisions.
B. Sidewalk Modification Procedure: A petitioner may submit an alternate sidewalk plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the request for
sidewalk modification, and submit its recommendation to the Village Board along with transmittal of the preliminary plat. Modifications from the sidewalk
requirement may be granted in the following cases:
1. Where tracts of land are created having at least three hundred feet (300') of frontage which could be resubdivided into smaller lots at a future time.
2. Where the subdivision designer has submitted for review a proposed sidewalk plan that provides for more direct and safer movement of pedestrian
traffic.
C. Sidewalk Construction Standards:
1. Sidewalk Locations:
a. The subdivider/developer shall be required, at no cost to the Village, to construct sidewalks along two (2) sides of every new or improved street.
b. No variation from this requirement shall be granted unless the Village Board of Trustees, having considered an advisory report from the Planning
and Zoning Commission, determines that in the area in question, topographical conditions make the installation of sidewalks impractical.
2. Construction Requirements: Every sidewalk shall be constructed of brush finished concrete in accordance with the following requirements:
a. Every sidewalk shall be constructed to generally parallel the street and be placed to a thickness of at least four inches (4"), provided, however, that
any sidewalk located across a point of ingress or egress for vehicles shall be placed to a thickness of at least six inches (6").
b. Control joints shall be grooved or saw cut to a depth of one-fourth (1/4) the thickness of sidewalk provided so that no individual slab shall be longer
than six feet (6') nor less than four feet (4') on any one side.
c. Expansion joints of three-fourths inch (3/4") premolded joint filler shall be placed at the edge of driveway crossings, at both ends of the sidewalk, at
the back of the curb when the sidewalk abuts. At intervals of not more than one hundred feet (100'), expansion joints of one-half inch (1/2")
premolded joint filler shall be placed adjacent to all structures.
d. No sidewalk shall be constructed at a grade steeper than allowed by the Americans with disabilities act adopted by the U.S. department of justice,
current edition.
e. The cross slope shall not exceed one and one-half percent (1.5%).
f. Curbs shall be cut and sidewalks ramped at all intersections and driveways so as to enhance the mobility of handicapped individuals and comply
with the Americans with disabilities act.
g. All ramps at intersections and other hazardous vehicularways shall have a detectable warning texture per the Americans with disabilities act.
h. When a sidewalk intersects with the top of a storm sewer inlet cover, the inlet cover dimension perpendicular to the street shall be increased so
that the edge of the cover which is parallel to and furthest away from the street, thereby incorporating the inlet cover into the sidewalk per the
Americans with disabilities act. This provision shall not be required if the area between the sidewalk and curb is wide enough to allow an inlet
cover independent of the sidewalk.
i. No trees, shrubs or bushes shall be planted between the sidewalk and the curb unless the sidewalk is ten feet (10') back of the curb. Decorative
landscaping using plants and flowers in proximity to mailboxes is acceptable.
j. In residential areas, sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in width.
k. The sidewalks preferred location is seven feet (7') behind the back of curb along streets and around the radii of cul-de-sacs and curves.
3. Delay Of Sidewalk Construction:
a. Because driveways in a new residential subdivision cannot be effectively located until lots are sold and developed thereby inhibiting the initial
installation of sidewalks throughout the development, the subdivider/developer may require that individual owners install sidewalks in accordance
with these provisions at the same time that the owners' driveway is constructed. No final building inspection will be considered complete until
sidewalks and/or driveways are constructed and approved, and permit fee paid.
b. Failure of the owner to install sidewalks shall not release the subdivider/developer from the ultimate responsibility for installation of the sidewalks.
All sidewalks must be completed by the subdivider/developer (if not installed at the time of street construction) within two (2) years of the final plat
approval. Sufficient funds shall be retained from the developer to cover the cost of sidewalk construction when not completed with other
subdivision improvements.
4. Commercial Sidewalks: In commercial and other nonresidential areas, sidewalks shall be a minimum of six feet (6') in width and additional widths
may be required based on anticipated use. Sidewalks shall be located as far as practical from the traffic lanes, usually abutting the right of way line.
D. Sidewalk ADA Accessibility Requirements: Sidewalks along the accessible route shall be constructed in accordance with the Illinois department of
transportation bureau of local roads and street section 31-2.02 and the public rights of way accessibility guidelines (PRWAG). Where practical, these
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 315/338
standards should also be used for other sidewalks built as part of the project which are not on the accessible route in order to provide for future
changes in accessible routes. Special attention is directed toward the following items:
1. Width: The normal width of sidewalk constructed as part of a roadway project is five feet (5') with a buffer area between the curb and sidewalk. If no
buffer area is provided, the sidewalk shall be six feet (6') wide to accommodate any appurtenances that may be included in the sidewalk. However,
because of restrictions such as poles, right of way, etc., this width at times may be reduced; but the minimum unrestricted width at any point along
the accessible route shall be four feet (4'), exclusive of the width of the curb. If a sidewalk width less than five feet (5') is used for some distances,
passing spaces of at least five feet by five feet (5' x 5') shall be provided at reasonable intervals not to exceed two hundred feet (200').
2. Longitudinal Slope: The longitudinal slope of the sidewalk on an accessible route that is within a street or highway right-of-way shall not exceed the
general grade established for the adjacent street or highway. Where the accessible route is not contained within a street or highway right-of-way, the
grade shall not exceed 5.00 percent. Any sidewalk on an accessible route that is not within a street or highway right-of-way with slopes greater than
5.00 percent shall be considered a ramp and shall be designed as a ramp. A sidewalk complying with these ramp standards shall have a maximum
slope of 8.33 percent with a maximum rise for any sidewalk of thirty inches (30").
3. Cross Slope: The perpendicular slope of the sidewalk on an accessible route shall be less than or equal to 2.00 percent. Where driveways or alleys
intersect with sidewalks, the design priority shall be given to the sidewalk and not the driveway or alley. This may also require ramping the sidewalk
down to the driveway. Such ramps shall be less than or equal to 8.33 percent longitudinal slope.
4. Protruding Objects: Objects such as signs shall not protrude more than four inches (4") into the walking area when the headroom below the object is
less than eighty four inches (84"). At no time may these protruding objects reduce the clear width of the accessible route below forty eight inches
(48").
5. Drainage Structures: Drainage structures such as manholes or inlet grates should not normally be placed within the walking area on an accessible
route. However, at times, ground topography is such that it is unavoidable. When drainage structures must be placed in the walking area, they shall
have spaces no greater than one-half inch (1/2") in one direction. If the grating has an elongated opening, it shall be placed so that the long
dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
11-5-8: UNDERGROUND UTILITIES:
A. Gas, electric power, telephone and cable television, and other utilities, except surface stormwater facilities, shall be located underground throughout the
subdivision. Except, however, that the following shall be excluded from this requirement:
1. Poles used exclusively for street lighting.
2. Antennas, associated equipment and supporting structures used for furnishing communication services.
3. Equipment appurtenant to underground facilities, such as surface mounted transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and
concealed ducts.
4. Temporary poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures used for a period not to exceed six (6) months which are necessary to provide
utility service until the permanent service is completed.
5. Poles, wires and controller cabinets necessary for the operation of traffic signals.
6. Poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures used for the transmission of electric energy at nominal voltages in excess of thirty four
thousand five hundred (34,500) volts. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
7. Other utility facilities which may be exempted by the Board of Trustees based on a recommendation from the Public Works Director. (Ord. 2015-18,
4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
B. All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat. Underground service connections to the
street property line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider's expense. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
11-5-9: PROVISION OF GREEN SPACE:
A. General Green Space Requirements:
1. Proposed subdivisions shall contain active and passive green space as provided in subsections B and C of this section. Such green space shall be
owned (either in fee simple or by perpetual easement), supervised, managed and maintained by the developer, subdivision property owners or
homeowners' association. The green space shall consist of active and passive green space, whether developed for recreational uses or not, but shall
not include water detention, or other stormwater management areas; however, ponds, lakes or natural wetlands that are part of the stormwater
management system shall be considered as green space. Green space must be accessible to all lots via rights-of-way or easements to preclude
having to cross private land. Creative use of green space will be encouraged.
2. The subdivision's covenants and restrictions shall include language to the effect that, if the property owners fail to maintain the green space, the
village has the authority to maintain the green space and impose a lien on each lot in the subdivision for its share of the maintenance costs. The
developer shall have the duty to maintain the green space until such a time as seventy percent (70%) of the lots have been sold or individual
property owners control the association. However, the developer shall be responsible for construction details and construction quality of green space
areas for a two (2) year period as provided in section 11-4-1 of this title.
3. As part of the developer's site plan approval responsibilities, developers shall be responsible for the improvements to the development for active and
passive green space purposes including, but not limited to, finished grading and ground cover for all green spaces within their development.
4. In a phased subdivision the developer must provide the required green space for the subdivision in proportional amounts for each phase of the
development. The amount of green space exceeding the requirements in a completed phase may be applied toward any future phase of the
subdivision.

1. Single-family residential district (RS-10): See subsection C1 of this section.
2. Two-family residential districts (RT) and multi-family (RM) districts: Twenty percent (20%) of the total area of the subdivision, which shall consist of
eight percent (8%) of the total area as passive green space and twelve percent (12%) of the total area as active green space.
3. All other districts: Four percent (4%) of the total area of the subdivision, which shall consist of passive green space all of which shall be provided
within the subdivision.
C. Compliance With Green Space Requirements And Fees: In providing the required area of green space within the subdivision the required amount of
green space must be provided within the boundaries of the proposed subdivision:
1. The owner/developer shall pay to the village for allocation of park improvements fund the following sums:
a. Single-family residence district (RS-10): Seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per lot.
b. Residential multi-family (RM) and residential two-family (RT): Seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per dwelling unit.
c. Planned development residential (PDP): Seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per dwelling unit.
2. The green space fees are to be paid as follows: One-half (1/2) of said amounts shall be paid at the time of approval of the final plat of the subdivision.
The remaining amount due shall be paid within one year of the date of the approval of the final plat. If either payment is not made the village shall
have the right to proceed against the security provided in section 11-4-1 of this title.
D. Protection Of Green Space: Green space shall be protected from development through platting, deed restrictions or restrictive covenants which will
ensure its perpetual use as green space as defined in this title and which further provides that no changes in use may be made without the express
written consent of the village.
1. All funds collected under this provision shall be placed in the park improvement fund. The monies of which shall be used solely for acquisition of new
ground for parks and/or capital improvements of existing parks as authorized and allocated by the village board of trustees.
E. Parks:
1. Reservation Of Land Required: The planning and zoning commission shall require that land be reserved for parks and playgrounds or other
recreation purposes in locations designated by the comprehensive plan or official map. The area shall be shown and marked on the plat, "Reserved
For Park And/Or Recreation Purposes".
2. Recommendation And Approval Of Park Sites: The planning and zoning commission shall refer any subdivision proposed to contain a dedicated
park to the board of trustees for a recommendation. All land to be reserved for dedication to the Village for park purposes shall have prior approval of
the Board of Trustees and shall be shown marked on the plat, "Reserved For Park And/Or Recreation Purposes".
3. Other Green Space: The provisions of this section are minimum standards. None of the paragraphs above shall be construed as prohibiting a
developer from providing other land for green space purposes in addition to the requirements of this section.
F. Green Area Buffers Along Bike Paths:
1. Every residential subdivision platted after the effective date hereof and which abuts or straddles an existing or proposed bike path, as indicated in
the bike trail plan section of the transportation element of the Village comprehensive plan, shall provide an appropriate permanent green area buffer
along such existing or proposed bike path. All said green area buffers shall be included on the respective subdivision plats and appropriately
integrated into the restrictive covenants for the subdivision.
2. Every residential subdivision lot for which a building is proposed or potentially allowed shall be separated from every existing and proposed bike path
right-of-way by a green area buffer with a minimum width of twenty five feet (25'). The design and layout of the green area buffer shall provide for the
maximum possible physical segregation and screening between the adjacent subdivision lots and the existing or proposed bike path right-of-way.
3. The green area buffer will be set aside as common grounds of the subdivision. Such green area buffers may be applied to the green space
requirements. The developer may request that the green area buffer be dedicated to the Village.
4. The green area buffers shall not be developed or improved, except as authorized by this subsection. To the extent feasible, these green area buffers
shall remain in their natural state, retaining the existing topography with its trees and vegetation. However, the developer shall appropriately plant
such green area buffers with other vegetation and perennial grasses for proper soil stabilization and additional trees for proper screening of adjacent
residential lots. Where the green area buffers are dedicated as subdivision common ground green space, appropriate subdivision restrictive
covenants shall be established to ensure that no subsequent improvements are made and the natural setting of the land is retained after the
subdivision is platted. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
5. An exception to the improvement restrictions of green area buffers in subsection F4 of this section may be made for the proper provision of Village
water and sewer facilities. Where necessary or desirable, as determined by the Public Works Director or designee, water and sewer facilities may be
placed through the green area buffers. All subdivision plats shall provide a Village utility easement for placement and maintenance of water and
sewer improvements throughout the green area buffers. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
6. In the establishment of green area buffers, the developer is encouraged to utilize creative and unique design criteria when integrating the green area
buffer requirements into the overall layout of the respective subdivision plats.
7. If the dedication of green area buffers would cause great practical difficulties or undue hardship, the developer may apply for relief by formally
requesting a variance to such requirements as provided in section 11-1-11 of this title.

G. Bike Path Accessways:
1. Every residential subdivision platted after the effective date hereof which abuts or straddles an existing or proposed bike path, as indicated in the
bike trail plan section of the transportation element of the Village comprehensive plan, shall provide appropriate permanent bike path accessways to
connect its subdivision streets to existing or proposed bike paths. All such bike path accessways shall be dedicated to the Village and included on
the respective subdivision plats.
2. Every platted residential subdivision which abuts or straddles an existing or proposed bike path shall provide one or more bike path accessways for
the connection of such bike paths to the residential streets within the subdivision. The layout and number of such bike path accessways shall be
designed to provide all residents of a given subdivision access to the bike trail via the internal street network of the subdivision.
3. Each bike path accessway shall consist of a minimum right-of-way width of thirty feet (30'), extending from the existing or proposed bike path to one
or more residential streets within the subdivision. The respective bike path accessways shall be dedicated to the Village.
4. Each bike path accessway shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles with the connecting subdivision street and the main bike
path adjacent to the subdivision. Said subdivision street connection with the bike path accessway shall not be placed within one hundred feet (100')
of an intersection of two (2) streets. Any bike path accessway intersecting at a street subdivision cul-de-sac shall have a centerline radial from the
center of the cul-de-sac. Adequate sightlines shall be provided at all bike path accessway intersections.
5. The grades of bike path accessways shall conform as closely as possible to the natural topography, and in no case shall the pavement structure
exceed a maximum grade of ten percent (10%) or exceed any State or Federal requirements. Pavement grades shall be limited to a maximum of
three percent (3%) within ten feet (10') of any bike path accessway intersection. Cross slopes of bike path accessway pavements shall be designed
with a two percent (2%) slope to provide proper drainage and biking surfaces. The earth shoulders of a bike path accessway, extending from the
edge of the pavement, shall be sloped for proper drainage and soil stabilization, but shall not exceed a three to one (3:1) slope. The developer shall
plant these earth shoulders in perennial grasses to ensure proper control of soil erosion and sedimentation runoff.
6. Bike path accessways shall be improved by the developer with a ten foot (10') wide bike path surface as specified for alleys and access easements
in subsection 11-5-3B6b of this chapter. These standards along with other applicable requirements of this title shall also apply to bike path
accessway improvements. The developer shall also pay for all required bike path accessway signage required based on Village specifications in title
7, chapter 3 of this Code, as same now exists or is hereafter modified or amended.
7. In the establishment of bike path accessways, the developer is encouraged to utilize creative and unique design criteria when integrating bike path
accessway requirements into the overall layout of the respective subdivision plats.
8. If the dedication of bike path accessways would cause great practical difficulties or undue hardship, the developer may apply for relief by formally
requesting a variance to such requirements as provided in section 11-1-11 of this title.
H. Other Public Uses:
1. Plat To Provide For Public Uses: Except when an applicant utilizes planned development procedures in which land is set aside by the developer as
required by the provision of the zoning ordinance, whenever a tract to be subdivided includes recreation uses, or other public use as indicated in any
portion of the comprehensive plan or official map, the space shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant into its preliminary plat. After proper
determination of its necessity by the Board of Trustees and the appropriate official of any other public agency involved in the acquisition and use of
each such site and a determination has been made to acquire the site by the public agency, the site shall be suitably incorporated by the applicant
into the preliminary and final plats.
2. Referral To Public Body: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend the preliminary plat to the Board of Trustees for its consideration
and approval. The Board of Trustees may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public body or agency thirty (30) days for
reply. The agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an
estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition.
3. Notice To Property Owner: Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the Board of Trustees shall notify the property owner and shall designate on the
preliminary and final plats that area proposed to be acquired by the public body.
4. Duration Of Land Reservation: The acquisition of land reserved by a public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within twelve (12) months of
notification, in writing, from the owner that he intends to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a preliminary plat of the
proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed
twelve (12) months shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and the freeing of the property for
development in accordance with these regulations. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
11-5-10: PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES:
A. Generally: Existing features that would add value to residential development or to the Village as a whole, such as trees, as herein defined,
watercourses, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any
subdivision nor any change of grade of the land affected until approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. Any lot that retains trees should
preserve trees of eight inch (8") caliper or more. When, because of setbacks or other lot factors, the footprint of the house requires destruction of more
than twenty five percent (25%) of such trees, a new tree of at least two and one-half inch (21/2") caliper size should be planted for each lost tree. All
trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees where required shall be welled and protected against change of grade. The
preliminary plat shall show the number and location of existing trees as required by these regulations and shall further indicate all those marked for
retention and the location of all proposed street trees required along the street side of each lot as required by these regulations.
B. Street Trees To Be Planted By Developer:
1. As a requirement of subdivision approval, the applicant shall plant street trees on the property of the subdivision. Such trees are to be planted within
five feet (5') of the right-of-way of the road or roads within and abutting the subdivision, or, at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, within the rightof-
way of such roads. One tree shall be planted for every lot located within the development except that lots in excess of one hundred twenty feet
(120') must have adequate trees to meet the Building and Zoning Administrator's approval and corner lots must be required a tree for each frontage.
Each tree shall be located within the right-of-way of said lot frontage and along each road unless the Board of Trustees grant a waiver. The waiver
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 318/338
shall be granted only if there are trees growing along the right-of-way or on the abutting property which, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees,
comply with these regulations.
2. New trees to be provided pursuant to these regulations shall have a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches (21/2"). Such trees shall be selected
from among the species in the definition of approved street tree contained in chapter 2 of this title. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
C. Shade Tree Easement And Dedication: The preliminary plat and final plat shall reserve an easement authorizing the Village to plant street trees within
five feet (5') of the required road right-of-way. No street shall be accepted for dedication until the Public Works Director or designee shall inform the
Planning and Zoning Commission and Board of Trustees that compliance with these regulations, where necessary, has been made. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-
28-2015; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 4-24-2018)
D. Review Of Planting Proposal: Planting proposals must be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
E. Maintenance Of Trees: Shade or street trees must be maintained (properly watered, pruned and staked, if necessary) for a period of eighteen (18)
months from project completion. The maintenance of new or replacement trees shall be the responsibility of the developer until the property is
transferred to the owner, who shall assume the remaining term of maintenance responsibility. Shade or street trees which die within eighteen (18)
months of project completion shall be replaced by the developer.
F. Protection Of Publicly Owned Trees:
1. Street trees and trees in parks or on any other Village property may not be damaged by any person. Persons or parties in violation of this prohibition
shall be subject to penalties.
2. The Village will, at public expense, prune, remove and replace street trees and trees on public property.
G. Public Utility Companies: Public utility companies shall notify the Village prior to the initiation of pruning cycles which will involve trees located on Village
owned property for the purpose of maintaining safe line clearance. The notice should state the estimated time frame of pruning cycle as well as the
planned locations in the Village where the work will be performed. All pruning work shall be carried out in accordance with accepted arboricultural
standards. Public utility companies shall also notify the Village prior to the installation or maintenance of underground utilities if such activity will occur
within the drip line of trees located on Village owned property. In the case of severe storms, natural disasters, or other emergency situations, a public
utility company may perform any required pruning or underground utility maintenance necessitated by such situation and thereafter notify the Village of
the work performed. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
11-5-11: PRESERVATION OF RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION COMMON GROUNDS AND GREEN SPACE AREAS:
A. Unless the Village Board of Trustees determines that exigent circumstances justify otherwise, every existing or future residential subdivision common
ground or green space area shall continue to exist on a perpetual basis. This is to ensure the preservation of present and future subdivision common
ground or green space or land devoted to subdivision recreational activities, parklike area, buffers or other open space in the respective subdivisions.
B. Existing and future subdivision common grounds and green space areas shall not be allowed to be split, subdivided or replatted. No portion or whole of
any subdivision common ground shall be allowed to be combined with or transferred into any other tract of land, platted area, or lot. Each subdivision
common ground and green space area will continue to exist, on an ongoing basis, as a separate legal entity as it was originally platted in the
establishment of the subdivision.
C. No residential structures or commercial buildings shall be permitted to be constructed on any subdivision common ground or green space area.
Applicable subdivision restrictive covenants for the common grounds and green space areas will apply and govern the ongoing management and
maintenance of the subdivision common grounds and green space areas.
D. It is envisioned that normally the subdivision common grounds will be established and maintained under the ongoing ownership of an entity of the
respective subdivisions. If, however, the ownership of a subdivision common ground area is transferred to another third party through a forced sale
such as delinquent taxes, other court ordered action, or any other type of land transfer, the restrictions of this section along with other applicable
sections of this title will continue to apply. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
11-5-12: NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS:
A. Generally: If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect to the
land shall make provision as the Board of Trustees may require. A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements of site plan
approval set forth in the zoning ordinance. Site plan approval and nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion
of the Board of Trustees. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these regulations, as well as such additional standards
required by the Board of Trustees, and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the comprehensive plan, official map, and
zoning ordinance.
B. Standards: In addition to the principles and standards in these regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning Commission that the street, parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the
uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed:
1. Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
2. Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 319/338
3. Special requirements may be imposed by the Village with respect to street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
4. Special requirements may be imposed by the Village with respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and stormwater
drainage.
5. Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or potential residential development and provisions for a permanently
landscaped buffer strip when necessary.
6. Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential
residential areas. (Ord. 2015-18, 4-28-2015)
Chapter 6
EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES IMPACT FEES
11-6-1: TITLE AND INTENT:
A. Title: This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES IMPACT FEE ORDINANCE.
B. Legislative Intent: As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer
shall be required to dedicate land for school purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or shall be
required to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village of Glen Carbon (the "village")
and with the concurrence of Edwardsville community school district 7 ("district 7"), which concurrence shall be obtained in writing. However, the village
shall have the final decision making power in this regard. The dedications and cash contributions required hereunder shall be made in accordance with
the criteria and formulas herein. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-2: CRITERIA FOR SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION, CASH CONTRIBUTION OR BOTH:
A. Criteria For Requiring School Site Dedications:
1. Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of
land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of the estimated number of
children to be served in each school classification (as described in subsection A2 of this section) from the subdivision or planned unit development
over the maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio
to the appropriate number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land
deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increase in number of students for each such school classification.
2. School Classifications And Acreage: These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and literature on the subject,
including, but not limited to, information provided by the state superintendent of education and the unique characteristics of Glen Carbon and
Madison County, including its generally rural character and open spaces, and the desire of the residents to maintain this character and open space in
future school sites. These requirements for acreage shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any
cash in lieu of land dedication herein unless timely objected to as provided herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular
development shall be made in accordance with section 11-6-9 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission. Failure to timely object to these
acreage requirements in accordance with section 11-6-9 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
School classifications and size of school sites serving the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
School Classification
By Grades
Maximum Number Of
Students For Each Such
School Classification
Appropriate Number Of
Acres Of Land For Each
School Site Of Such
Classification
Elementary schools, grades kindergarten through 5th or 6th 450 25
Junior high or middle schools grades 6th through 8th or 7th and 8th 600 40
High schools, grades 9th through 12th 1,500 70
3. Location: The standards adopted by district 7 shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. School sites shall be located in the village in accordance
with plans heretofore or hereafter adopted by district 7.
B. Criteria For Requiring Cash Contribution: When the development is small and the resulting site to be dedicated is too small to be practical, or when the
available land is inappropriate for a school site or is in conflict with the approved standards or plan of district 7, the village, with the concurrence of
district 7, shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication.
The cash contribution in lieu of dedication of school sites, and any and all interest earned thereon, shall be held in trust by district 7 or other public body
designated by the village, and shall be used for the acquisition of land for school sites to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that
subdivision or development, or for the improvement to any existing school site that already serves such needs, or for the construction of school
buildings or additions thereto in accordance with public act 93-0330, or for any purpose defined by agreement with the subdivider or developer at the
time of platting. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of dedication of school sites is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within thirteen
(13) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded by the entity holding the contribution to the record owner of the subdivided land at the time of
the refund. If there is more than one record owner of the subdivided land or of the land that comprises the planned unit development, as applicable,
such record owners shall share in the refund pro rata based on the cash contributions originally paid by each property.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 320/338
1. Fair Market Value: In the interest of developing an impact fee that is relatively uniform throughout district 7 territory, the cash contributions in lieu of
land shall be based on thirty five percent (35%) of the maximum possible impact fee generated under the formulas described in this chapter. In
calculating the fair market value on a per acre basis, unless determined otherwise pursuant to section 11-6-9 of this chapter, the following
assumptions about the land shall be made: a) that it is zoned in a one-family dwelling residential zoning district consistent with the village's
development standards; b) that it is subdivided with appropriate frontage on a dedicated street or road, stubbed with municipal sewer and water, has
all appropriate utilities available; c) that it is improved as set forth in sections 11-6-5 and 11-6-6 of this chapter; and d) that it is otherwise property
capable of being used for residential development. Based upon a study of real estate transactions in the village for the past three (3) years, it has
been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is, as of the effective date hereof, one
hundred thirty five thousand dollars ($135,000.00) per acre. These figures shall be adjusted by the village board from time to time with appropriate
study and documentation. The fair market value as defined above shall be used in calculating any cash contribution in lieu of land dedication
required herein unless timely objected to as provided in section 11-6-9 of this chapter. Objections to the fair market value as defined above shall be
made in accordance with section 11-6-9 of this chapter to the planning and zoning commission. Failure to timely object to the fair market value as
defined above in accordance with section 11-6-9 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
2. Consumer Price Index: The fair market value identified in subsection B1 of this section shall be subject to a "CPI adjustment" which shall be
calculated on January 1, 2005, and on January 1 in each year thereafter. Annually, the fixed charge shall be adjusted by the annual percentage
change as published by the United States department of labor's bureau of labor statistics, all items consumer price index ("CPI") for urban
consumers (1982-1984 = 100) for the St. Louis, Missouri-Illinois area. If any index is calculated from a base different from the base period 1982-1984
= 100, such index shall be converted to a base period of 1982-1984 = 100 by use of a conversion factor supplied by said bureau of labor statistics. If
the CPI is discontinued or replaced, such other governmental cost of living index or computation which replaces the CPI shall be used in order to
obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the CPI had not been discontinued or replaced.
C. Criteria For Requiring Dedication And Contribution: There will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land
dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 1) only a portion of the land to be developed is
proposed as the location for a school site (that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the school location shall be dedicated as a site as
stated above, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated); or 2) a
major part of the local school site has already been acquired by the particular district and only a small portion of land is needed from the developer to
complete the site (the remaining portion shall be required by a cash contribution in lieu thereof). (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-3: DENSITY FORMULA:
The "Table Of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit" ("the density formula"), attached as exhibit A to ordinance 2004-9, prepared by Ehlers &
Associates, Inc., November 2000, and as updated from time to time, is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for
new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a
written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer.
A bedroom, as used in this chapter, shall include any room which may be used for bedroom purposes, such as a den, study, loft or extra room located on
any floor in a dwelling unit which may be convertible into a sleeping area and is not clearly identified for some other specific purpose such as a kitchen (1
per unit), dining room (1 per unit), living room (1 per unit), bathroom(s) and family room (1 per unit).
This density formula, as updated, shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication herein unless objected to as provided in section 11-6-9 of
this chapter. The village recognizes that the density formula may be updated from time to time and will, as a result, adopt these updates periodically by
amending this chapter accordingly. Objections to the density formula shall be made in accordance with section 11-6-9 of this chapter to the planning and
zoning commission. Failure to object to the density formula in accordance with section 11-6-9 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an
objection at a later time.
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the density formula listed above, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the
estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development, and in that event final determination of the density
formula shall be made in accordance with section 11-6-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-4: ADDITIONAL LAND AND ADJOINING DEVELOPMENTS:
A. Reservation Of Additional Land: When the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village call for a larger amount of school sites in a particular
subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is required to dedicate pursuant to this chapter, the land needed beyond the developer's
dedication shall be set aside and reserved by the developer for subsequent purchase (at a price determined at the time of reservation) by the village or
other public body designated by the village, provided that such acquisition is made within five (5) years from the date of approval of the final plat.
B. Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where appropriate, a school site that is to be dedicated should, if possible, be combined with dedications
from adjoining developments in order to produce usable school sites without undue hardship on a particular developer. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-5: TOPOGRAPHY AND SOIL DATA:
A. Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose.
Stormwater detention areas shall not be accepted for village ownership and maintenance, and the portion of a detention area designed to function
primarily as a component of the stormwater control system shall not serve as a credit toward the required site dedication. Stormwater retention areas
shall not be accepted for village ownership and maintenance and shall not serve as a credit toward the required site dedication. Wetlands, floodplains,
detention areas, retention areas and areas of steep slope shall not be accepted as school sites and shall not serve as a credit toward the required
school site cash contribution in lieu of land dedication.
In addition, the following site conditions and preparation standards shall be met:

d. Seeding shall be watered sufficiently so that the vegetation becomes reasonably established; and
e. The developer shall be responsible for making necessary reparations to the site caused by erosion or other damage. Reparations shall be
completed prior to acceptance of the site.
B. Suitability Of Soils At Site: The subdivider or developer, at its own cost or expense, shall provide to the village or district 7 soil boring data, soil
compaction test results and such other engineering studies, data and information pertaining to the proposed school site, which the village or district 7
may request to enable it to determine the suitability of the proposed land dedication for school site. The village or district 7 shall have the right to reject
any site which the village or district 7 determines, in accordance with sound engineering practices, is not suitable for school site purposes. (Ord. 2012-
11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-6: IMPROVED SITES:
All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electricity, natural gas, telephone and cable television, water, sewer and streets (including
enclosed drainage and curb and gutter, where applicable), as applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of the
subdivision regulations of the village of Glen Carbon. The landscaping normally included within the definition of "improved" sites under the subdivision
regulations of the village of Glen Carbon may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of any such school site and the construction of school
facilities thereon, except for ground cover as required in subsection 11-6-5A4 of this chapter. The site shall have direct access to a fully improved street
across at least twenty percent (20%) of the distance of its perimeter. School sites should ideally be accessible by a bicycle/pedestrian trail, and any such
access route onto the property shall be at least thirty feet (30') wide. Such access routes should normally be dedications and not easements, depending
on which entity of government is to be responsible for said routes. Any vehicular access route leading to or on the site shall be of sufficient size and good
geometry to properly accommodate vehicles that will access and traverse the site, including, but not limited to, good principles of traffic circulation,
accommodation of one-way and/or two-way drives for school buses, separation of bus traffic from passenger automobile traffic, bus drop off areas
separate from publicly dedicated streets, guest and employee parking areas, and the like. Such off street access routes, drives, drop offs and parking
areas will not be dedicated rights of way and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the site to maintain. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-7: ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT; HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

B. Real Estate Tax Escrow: The developer shall pay the general real estate taxes on the land not yet due and payable as of the date of transfer, and shall
deposit a sum of money in escrow with the intended grantee's attorney or a title company licensed to do business in the state of Illinois, which is
prorated as of the date of transfer on the basis of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the tax assessor's latest assessed valuation, the latest known
equalization factors and the latest known tax rate on the land. In the event the previous tax information or the previous tax bill includes other property,
then the amount to be deposited in escrow shall be adjusted ratably based on the net acreage of the land compared to the net acreage of the other
parcels covered by said tax bills. After the land has been divided for real estate tax purposes and has been conveyed to the intended grantee, the
grantee shall proceed with due diligence to apply for a real estate tax exemption on the land. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-9: OBJECTIONS:
All objections relating to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair market value, the density formula, or any other application of this chapter to a
particular subdivision or planned unit development, shall first be referred to the planning and zoning commission for a hearing. An objection must be made,
if at all, prior to the approval of the final plat of subdivision by the village. A failure to object by such time shall constitute a waiver of the right to object to
the provisions of this chapter. All developers submitting a plat of subdivision or resubdivision or a plat of a planned unit development to the village shall be
given a copy of this entire chapter, including the procedures for objecting to such an assessment as prescribed by this section. Upon receipt, the developer
must sign an accompanying document acknowledging that the developer has received notice of the existence of such a procedure for objections. This

herein by reference. This agreement shall be executed on or before June 1 of each year. Following execution of this agreement by district 7, this
indemnification agreement shall be furnished to the village. In the event district 7 fails to execute and/or furnish the executed agreement as required in
this chapter, the village reserves the right to refuse to impose any land dedications and/or cash contributions in lieu thereof on behalf of district 7.
B. Collection Of Fees: The cash contributions in lieu of land dedications imposed by this chapter shall be collected and held by district 7 in accordance with
the standards in this chapter and shall be used for the purposes set forth in this chapter. If necessary, district 7 shall provide written confirmation of
payment to the developer or subdivider that the developer or subdivider can present to the appropriate village authorities as proof of compliance with
the terms of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-12: NEEDS ASSESSMENT; ACQUISITION PLAN:
As a condition to the imposition of these land dedications and/or cash contributions in lieu of land dedications, the village shall require that district 7
conduct a needs assessment and adopt a plan for acquisition of land and capital facilities needed to accommodate growth.
A. A needs assessment shall contain the following information for the school district:
1. A description of the nature and location of existing school sites and existing schools within the district.
2. An identification of the capacity of each school building within the particular district and of the number of students then enrolled in each school
building.
3. A projection of the character and location of new development that is expected to occur within the district during the succeeding ten (10) year period.
The district may obtain the information necessary to make this projection from sources such as, but not limited to: municipalities, other units of
government, agencies and consultants.
4. An identification of the amount of school lands that will be necessary within the district in order to accommodate the demands of such projected new
development, and an estimate of the public grounds acquisition costs that will be incurred or have been incurred by the district in acquiring such
lands.
5. General description of each classification of school capital facilities (including construction, expansion or enhancement of any public facilities and the
land improvement, design, engineering and professional costs related thereto) that will be necessary within the district in order to provide school
capacity for the projected new development, and an estimate of the capital facilities costs that will be incurred by the district in constructing such
capital facilities.
B. Based upon the needs assessment, the district shall provide the village an acquisition plan for school sites and capital facilities. This acquisition plan
shall:
1. Project for a planning period of at least five (5) years, the need for school sites within the district;
2. Set forth a schedule for the acquisition of such lands and facilities to meet the projected need (which schedule may be conditioned upon the
availability of financing);
3. Indicate the size and general location of the needed lands and facilities;
4. Identify the estimated or incurred costs of acquiring such needed lands and facilities;
5. Set forth the anticipated funding sources for the acquisition of such needed lands and facilities;

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 325/338
C. If the village deems it necessary, it may require an updated needs assessment and plan for acquisition of land and capital facilities from the district
annually. The failure to require said assessment update shall not invalidate the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-13: TIME OF PAYMENT:
All land dedications and cash contributions imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable upon final plat approval. At the time of payment (at time of
final plat approval or at time of building permit issuance), the subdivider or developer shall receive a copy of this chapter and shall execute an
acknowledgment that a copy of this chapter has been received. The executed acknowledgment shall be maintained and filed along with documents
evidencing proof of land dedication or payment of cash contributions in lieu of land dedication by each subdivider or developer.
A. Payment At Time Of Platting: In calculating the cash contributions to be paid at the time of platting, the village will assume the maximum density
permitted under the zoning classification approved pursuant to the density formula. For example, if the subdivision in question is zoned single-family,
the village will assume for purposes of calculating cash contributions payable, pursuant to this chapter, that all houses will have five (5) bedrooms.
District 7 will then hold sufficient funds pending issuance of the building permit to enable it to refund any overpayments resulting from the fact that
houses with less than five (5) bedrooms are constructed. Refunds shall be made at time of issuance of the building permit upon application by the
developer to district 7.
B. Payment At Time Of Building Permit Issuance: The village may agree that the payment of the cash contributions may be made at the time of building
permit issuance in consideration of which the subdivider or developer shall execute an agreement, which is set forth and attached as exhibit D to
ordinance 2004-9 and incorporated herein by reference. The agreement provides that the developer agrees: 1) that the cash contributions payable will
be adjusted in accordance with the requirements herein; 2) that the cash contributions may be expended for the purposes described in exhibit D of
ordinance 2004-9; and 3) to accept the validity of this chapter and the cash contributions as calculated. This agreement, or memorandum thereof, shall
be recorded along with the plat of subdivision upon approval by the village.
In the event the village agrees to delay the payment of fees and cash contributions required herein to the time of building permit issuance, the fees and
cash contributions owed shall be those that are in effect at the time the building permit is issued. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)
11-6-14: MAINTENANCE AND INSURANCE:
In the event that land dedications are made to the village for the benefit of district 7 pursuant to any of the provisions of this chapter, district 7 shall provide
maintenance to the property and shall provide evidence of liability insurance for the property with the village of Glen Carbon and district 7 as named
insureds. (Ord. 2012-11, 3-13-2012)

"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred
repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done. The term does not, however, include either: a) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions; or b) any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of historic places or the Illinois register of historic places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or
other development without the required federal, state, and/or local permits and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as the
documentation is provided. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 329/338
This chapter's protection standard is the base flood. The best available base flood data are listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party shall finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace the existing data with better data and submit it to the federal
emergency management agency and IDNR/OWR for approval prior to any development of the site.
A. The base flood elevation for the floodplains of the Mississippi River shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of
the village prepared by the federal emergency management agency.
B. The base flood elevation for each floodplain delineated as an AH zone or AO zone shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance
rate map of the village.
C. The base flood elevation for each of the floodplains delineated as an "A zone" on the flood insurance rate map of the village shall be according to the
best data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to
determine base flood elevations.
D. The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Madison County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village,
or that may be annexed into the village, shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles of the flood insurance study of Madison County prepared
by the federal emergency management agency. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-1-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
A. Permit And Compliance Required: No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any development in the
floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the building and zoning administrator. The building and zoning administrator shall not issue
a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
B. Application For Permit: The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
1. Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions;
2. Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling;
3. The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings;
4. The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section 12-1-7 of this chapter; and
5. The cost of project or improvements as estimated by a licensed professional engineer or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet
this requirement.
C. Exemption From Permit: Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the building and zoning administrator shall compare the elevation of
the site to the base flood elevations. Any development located on land that is shown by survey elevation to be below the current base flood elevation is
subject to the provisions of this chapter. In addition, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected to a flood source, but not identified as floodplain on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter. Any
development located on land that can be shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled after
the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the provisions of this chapter. The building and
zoning administrator shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. The building and zoning administrator shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or permit not required letters that may be required for this
type of activity. The building and zoning administrator shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.

6. The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
7. All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
C. Effects And Risks Of Approved Variance: The building and zoning administrator shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements
of the building protection standards of section 12-1-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
1. Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
2. Increase the risks to life and property; and
3. Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
D. Historic Landmarks: Variances to the building protection requirements of section 12-1-7 of this chapter requested in connection with the reconstruction,
repair or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in "historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections 12-1-6 and 12-1-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
1. The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
2. The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being removed as a certified historic structure.
E. Agriculture:
1. Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique
circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
2. In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for
any variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and wet floodproofed:
a. All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the varied
structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement facilities, such as farmhouses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
b. Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate map
(FIRM).
c. For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section 12-1-7 of this chapter.
d. The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section 12-1-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood related forces including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
e. Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained
within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 12-1-7 of this
chapter.
f. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters in accordance with subsection 12-1-7B of this chapter.
g. The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway provisions of section 12-1-6 of this chapter. No variances may
be issued for agricultural structures within any designated floodway.
h. Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does
not imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part
of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully hereunder. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-1-13: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
A. Determination Of Violation; Notice: Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a
variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the building and zoning administrator may determine that a violation
of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The building and zoning administrator shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
B. Penalties: If such owner fails, after ten (10) days' notice, to correct the violation:
1. The village may make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court
deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=599 334/338
2. Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be punishable as provided in section 1-4-1 of this code;
3. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
4. The village shall record a notice of violation on the title of the property.
C. Notice Of Possible Insurance Cancellation: The building and zoning administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a wilful
act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The building and zoning administrator is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall
be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order.
The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
D. Hearing: No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the village. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
1. The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation, and
2. The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the village board of
trustees shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
E. Other Actions: Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person responsible. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other chapters adopted by the village board of trustees to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program
including SFHA-1. However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or chapter adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this
chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-1-15: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and the invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the
remainder. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)

This chapter shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage, approval, and publication as required by law. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
Chapter 2
SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL REGULATIONS
12-2-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to control soil erosion on land that is disturbed or undergoing changes to existing grades by adding or removing or relocating
dirt on site for nonagricultural purposes and to preserve the natural terrain and waterways of land within the incorporated portions of the village. Soil
erosion scars the land and creates sediment that clogs storm sewers and road ditches, chokes streams and creates silt lakes, all of which pose a threat to
public health and safety. The provisions of this chapter are intended to provide a natural community environment, to sustain aesthetic, recreational and fish
and wildlife habitat and values, to prevent soil erosion and to reduce costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, water conveyance systems, roads and
embankments. Application of the regulations in this chapter will effectively control soil erosion and sedimentation. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-2-2: SCOPE:
Any person, firm, corporation or business proposing to change existing grades by adding, removing or relocating any dirt within the village shall first apply
to the designated official for approval of required erosion control plans and issuance of a grading permit as specified in this chapter. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-
2015)
12-2-3: DEFINITIONS:

12-2-5: PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS:
A. All excavations, grading, or filling shall have a finished grade not to exceed a three to one (3:1) slope (33%). Steeper grades may be approved by the
designated official if the excavation is through rock or the excavation or the fill is adequately protected (a designed head wall or toe wall may be
required). Retaining walls that exceed a height of four feet (4') shall require the construction of safety guards as identified in the appropriate sections of
the adopted BOCA codes and must be approved by the village building and zoning department. Permanent safety guards will be constructed in
accordance with the appropriate section(s) of the adopted BOCA codes.
B. Sediment and erosion control plans for sites that exceed one acre of grading shall provide for sediment or debris basins, silt traps or filters, staked straw
bales or other approved measures to remove sediment from runoff waters, the design to be approved by the designated official. Temporary siltation
control measures (structural) shall be maintained until vegetative cover is established at a sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site.
(Refer to section 12-2-10, appendix A of this chapter.)
C. All lots less than one acre that are currently being constructed upon as commercial or residential or having fill dirt added, removed, or relocated from
any site in preparation for construction or grade changes to the lot may be required to take action to control silt runoff to public right of way or private
adjacent property as determined by the appropriate official. Failure to install appropriate siltation barriers to prevent silt runoff may result in stop work
orders until corrective action is taken. In addition, excessive siltation runoff from construction sites onto any adjacent property or right of way will be
cleaned by those responsible. If not cleaned up at the end of the day, the responsible party will be billed for overtime pay and equipment cost. Where
grade changes are made to existing vacant lots, no water runoff or silt runoff shall be directed to an adjacent property, and no natural water runoff shall
be altered to block or increase natural drainage.
D. Where natural vegetation is removed during grading, vegetation shall be reestablished in such a density as to prevent erosion. Permanent type grasses
shall be established as soon as possible or during the next seeding period after grading has been completed. (Refer to section 12-2-10, appendix A of
this chapter.)
E. When grading operations are completed or suspended for more than thirty (30) days, permanent grass must be established at sufficient density to
provide erosion control on the site. Between permanent grass seeding periods, temporary cover shall be provided according to the Illinois department
of transportation "Standard Specifications For Road And Bridge Construction". (Refer to section 12-2-10, appendix A of this chapter.) All finished
grades (areas not to be disturbed by future improvement) in excess of twenty percent (20%) slopes (5:1) shall be mulched and tacked at the rate of one
hundred (100) pounds per one thousand (1,000) square feet when seeded.
F. Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after grading. Unvegetated
open channels shall be designed so that gradients result in velocities of two (2) fps (feet per second) or less. Open channels with velocities more than
two (2) fps and less than five (5) fps shall be established in permanent vegetation by use of commercial erosion control blankets or lined with rock,
riprap or concrete or other suitable materials as approved by the designated official. Detention basins, diversions, or other appropriate structures shall
be constructed to prevent velocities above five (5) fps. (Refer to section 12-2-10, appendix B of this chapter.)
G. The adjoining ground to development sites (lots) shall be provided with protection from accelerated and increased surface water, silt from erosion, and
any other consequences of erosion, both during and following construction. Runoff water from developed areas (parking lots, paved sites and
buildings) upstream of the area to be developed shall be directed to diversions, detention basins, concrete gutters and/or underground outlet systems.
Sufficiently anchored straw bales may be temporarily substituted with the approval of the designated official. (Refer to section 12-2-10, appendix B of
this chapter.)
H. Development along natural watercourses shall have residential, commercial or industrial improvements, parking areas or driveways set back a
minimum of twenty five feet (25') from the top of the existing stream bank. The watercourse shall be maintained and made the responsibility of the

property owners, subdivision trustees, in the case, by the subdivision or multiple property owners, common ground. Permanent vegetation should be
left intact. Variances will include designed stream bank erosion control measures and shall be approved by the designated official. FEMA, IDNR/OWR
and U.S. army corps of engineers' guidelines shall be followed where applicable regarding site development areas designated as floodplains and
wetlands.
I. All lots shall be seeded and mulched at the rates defined in section 12-2-10, appendix A of this chapter or sodded before an occupancy permit shall be
issued; except, that a temporary occupancy permit may be issued by the building and zoning department in cases of undue hardship because of
unfavorable ground conditions.
J. Control nonstormwater discharges including concrete and wastewater from washout of concrete (unless managed by an appropriate control), drywall
compound, wastewater from washout of cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds and other construction materials, fuels, oils, or
other pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance, soaps, solvents, or detergents, toxic or hazardous substances from a spill
or other release, or any other pollutant that could cause or tend to cause water pollution. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-2-6: PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE:
Upon approval of the required erosion control plan and the issuance of a grading permit, the designated official shall require the developer to post an
escrow agreement, lender's agreement, or certified check in the amount of all work to be done under the erosion control plan. Ninety percent (90%) of the
funds will be released after all erosion control measures are in place and approved by the designated official. Ten percent (10%) will be held until the
public improvements are accepted by the village to ensure that the erosion control measures are maintained. If there are no public improvements (site
plans), the final ten percent (10%) will be held until release by the designated official. (Ord. 2015-19, 4-14-2015)
12-2-7: INSPECTIONS:
