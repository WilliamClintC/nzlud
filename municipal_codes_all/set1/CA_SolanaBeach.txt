B. Remedy the violation(s), if the violation(s) is of such a nature that it can be remedied. If the violation(s) is corrected before the date provided on the citation, no fine shall be payable. If the responsible person fails to correct the violation(s), subsequent administrative citations may be issued for the same violation(s). The amount of the fine for failure to correct the violation shall increase at a rate specified in this chapter or by resolution. (Ord. 283 § 2, 2002)


1.18.070 Appeal of administrative citation.

Any recipient of an administrative citation may contest that there was a violation of any ordinance, regulation, permit, entitlement, or agreement covered by this chapter, or that he or she is the responsible person, by completing a request for hearing form and returning it to the city within 15 days from the date of issuance of the administrative citation, together with a deposit in the amount of the fine. Any administrative citation deposit shall be refunded within 10 days of a determination, after a hearing, that the person charged in the administrative citation was not responsible for the violation(s) or that there was no violation(s) as charged in the administrative citation. (Ord. 283 § 2, 2002)


1.18.080 Hearing officer.

The Solana Beach city manager shall designate the hearing officer for the administrative citation hearing. The hearing officer shall not be a city employee. The compensation of the hearing officer, if any, shall be paid by the city. Compensation shall not be directly or indirectly conditioned upon whether or not administrative citations are upheld by the hearing officer. (Ord. 283 § 2, 2002)


1.18.090 Hearing procedure.

A. No hearing to appeal an administrative citation before a hearing officer shall be held unless and until a request for hearing form has been completed and submitted, and the deposit has been made.

B. A hearing before the hearing officer shall be set for a date that is not sooner than 15 and not more than 60 days from the date that the request for hearing is filed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If First Amendment rights are involved, the hearing shall be within five days from the date of such request. The person requesting the hearing shall be notified of the time and place set for the hearing at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing.

C. The hearing officer shall only consider evidence that is relevant to whether the violation(s) occurred and whether the responsible person has caused or maintained the violation(s). Courtroom rules of evidence shall not apply. Relevant hearsay evidence and written reports may be admitted whether or not the speaker or author is present to testify if the hearing officer determines that the evidence is reliable. Admission of evidence and the conduct of the hearing shall be controlled by the hearing officer in accordance with the fundamentals of due process. The hearing officer may limit the total length of the hearing to one hour, and shall allow the appellant at least as much time to present its case as is allowed the city.

D. The responsible person contesting the administrative citation shall be given the opportunity to testify and present witnesses and evidence concerning the administrative citation. The city’s case shall be presented by an enforcement officer or by the city attorney. The appellant may be represented by counsel.

E. The failure of the appellant to appear at the hearing shall constitute a forfeiture of the fine and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

F. The administrative citation and any additional documents prepared by the city in connection with the violation(s) may be submitted by the enforcement officer and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the respective facts contained in those documents.

G. If the enforcement officer submits any additional documents concerning the administrative citation to the hearing officer for consideration at the hearing, then, whenever possible, a copy of such documents shall be served by mail on the person requesting the hearing at least five days prior to the date of the hearing.

H. The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request additional information from the enforcement officer or the appellant prior to issuing a written decision. (Ord. 283 § 2, 2002)


1.18.100 Hearing officer’s decision.

A. After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision within 10 days of the hearing to uphold or deny the administrative citation and shall list in the decision the reasons for that decision. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final. If First Amendment rights are involved, the decision shall be issued orally at the conclusion of the hearing and shall be effective immediately. A written decision shall thereafter be issued as provided herein below.

B. If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation should be upheld, then the deposit with the city shall be retained by the city.

C. If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation was improperly issued, then the city shall promptly refund the deposit.

D. The appellant and the enforcement officer shall each be served by mail with a copy of the hearing officer’s written decision. (Ord. 283 § 2, 2002)


1.18.110 Failure to pay fines.

The failure of any person to pay the civil fines imposed by an administrative citation within the time specified on the citation may result in the filing of a claim with the small claims court for recovery of the fine. The only issue to be adjudicated by the small claims court shall be whether or not the fines were paid. A person cited may only obtain judicial review of the validity of the citation by first requesting and participating in an administrative hearing before a hearing officer. In the small claims court action, the city may also recover its collection costs, including the cost of the hearing officer, and any small claims court fees, according to proof. (Ord. 283 § 2, 2002)


1.18.120 Right to judicial review.

A. Either the city or the appellant aggrieved by a decision of a hearing officer on an administrative citation may obtain review of the decision by filing a Petition for Review with the San Diego Superior Court in accordance with the timelines and provisions as set forth in California Government Code Section 53069.4(b). Said procedure shall be available for all judicial review under this chapter, notwithstanding that the term or condition being enforced pursuant to this chapter may not be a matter covered by Section 53069.4(a). Judicial review of a citation shall not be available without first participating in a hearing as provided in this chapter.

B. Failure to receive any notice specified in this chapter does not affect the validity of proceedings conducted hereunder. (Ord. 283 § 2, 2002)

For the purpose of considering any item subject to vote of the council, when a member of the council is disqualified due to a conflict of interest, his presence shall not be considered in determining the presence of a quorum. Consideration on such item shall be deferred until a quorum of noninterested council members are present to discuss and vote on them if a disqualification reduces those in attendance to less than a quorum.

A. In order to facilitate the orderly conduct of the business of the council, an agenda shall be prepared for each regular meeting containing the specific items of business to be transacted and the order thereof. Items of business may be placed on the agenda by the direction of a member of the council, the city manager or the city attorney. Agenda items, including ordinances, resolutions, contracts, staff reports or other matters to be submitted to the council shall be delivered to the city manager by 12:00 noon on the Wednesday of the week preceding the regular meeting.

B. All agenda items, ordinances, resolutions and contract documents shall, before presentation to the council, have been approved as to form and legality by the city attorney or his authorized representative, and shall have been examined and approved for administration by the city manager or his authorized representative, where there are substantive matters of administration involved. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, any council member may place an item on the agenda without review by the city attorney or city manager by delivering it directly to the city clerk in accordance with subsection A.

C. No matters other than those listed on the agenda shall be finally acted upon by the council; provided, however, that matters not on the agenda but deemed to be of an important or urgent nature by any council member, the city manager or the city attorney may be submitted for council consideration and action, subject to an explanation of the importance or urgency stated in open council meeting. No matter may be considered by the council other than those matters on the agenda without the unanimous consent of the council present at the meeting.

D. The agenda shall contain a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed, shall specify the time and location of the meeting and shall be posted on the public bulletin board at City Hall. (Ord. 31 § 2, 1987; 1987 Code § 2.18.120)

A. Certain items for inclusion on the agenda which have been reviewed by the city manager, delivered to the city council and made available to the public prior to the council meeting shall be grouped together for action and listed under the consent calendar, when such matters are considered to be noncontroversial and in the nature of housekeeping items by the city manager, requiring only routine action by the council. Actions recommended by the city manager shall be in summary form and be a part of that item. Adoption of the consent calendar may be made by one motion approved by the council; provided, however, that the mayor should first advise the audience that the consent calendar matters will be adopted in total by one action of the council unless any council member or any individual or who has so requested wishes to be heard on one or more consent items. In that event, the mayor may defer action on the particular matter or matters and place them on the regular agenda for consideration in any order deemed appropriate.

Any person may submit oral or written communication to the city council on any matter listed on the agenda, subject to the following:

A. Any person desiring to address the council shall first obtain permission of the presiding officer.

The form must be submitted to the city clerk before the matter is considered by the city council.

B. Each person desiring to address the council shall approach the podium, state the subject he or she wishes to discuss, state whom he or she is representing if he or she represents an organization or other persons, and shall limit his or her remarks to three minutes. Further time may be granted to the person addressing the council by the majority vote of the council, or an individual who is present and donates his or her time to the person for a total of six minutes. Individuals donating their time waive their individual time to speak on the matter. All remarks shall be addressed to the council as a whole and not to individual members thereof. No questions shall be asked of a council member or a member of the city staff without obtaining permission of the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall not permit any communication, oral or written, to be made or read where it does not bear directly on the agenda item then under discussion.

C. After a motion has been made, no member of the public shall address the council from the audience on the matter under consideration without permission granted by a majority vote of the council.

Interested parties or their authorized representatives may address the council by written communication with regard to matters with which they are concerned and are then the subject of council discussion.

Written communications from the administrative staff shall not be read aloud unless requested by the writer or any council member. Anonymous communications shall not be considered or placed on the agenda.

E. When any identifiable group of persons, as opposed to the general public at large, wishes to address the council on the same agenda item, the mayor shall have the discretion to request that a spokesperson be chosen by said group to address the council. If additional issues are to be presented at the hearing by any other member of such group, the mayor may limit the number of persons and the time periods to address the council, so as to avoid unnecessary repetition of issues before the council. Groups of persons represented by a spokesperson shall be limited to a total presentation of 10 minutes. Additional time may be granted by a majority vote of the council.

F. For the purposes of this chapter, a “group” or “organization” shall be defined as at least three identified individuals, including the speaker, of the same group or organization who are present at the meeting. Representatives of a group or organization donating their time waive their individual time to speak on the matter. All representatives must provide their name on the representative’s speaker slip to identify themselves. (Ord. 361 §§ 3, 4, 5, 2007; Ord. 31 § 2, 1987; 1987 Code § 2.18.160)

Nothing herein shall prohibit or limit the city council from holding a public hearing on any matter before it, whether required by law or not, and nothing herein shall prohibit or limit any member of the public from addressing the council in accordance with the procedures provided for in this article, irrespective of whether or not a public hearing is being held.

B. All public hearings shall be scheduled to begin at a time certain which shall be the hour the council convenes. The council shall hold such hearings in order, in accordance with the schedule on the agenda at the time or as soon thereafter as practicable. (Ord. 31 § 2, 1987; 1987 Code § 2.18.170)

2.04.230 Public hearing – Evidence.

A. During the public hearing, the council shall receive oral or written evidence relevant to the matter being considered which shall become part of the record. The presiding officer or any member of the council through the presiding officer may require the city clerk to swear any person giving evidence at the time of the hearing on the matter under consideration, if in the opinion of the presiding officer or any member of the council, the oath is necessary. The rules of evidence as established by the Evidence Code for the state of California shall be substantially relaxed in order to afford a full presentation of the facts essential for judicious consideration by the council of the matter which is the subject of the public hearing. Failure on the part of the city council to strictly enforce rules of evidence or to reject matters which may be irrelevant or immaterial shall not affect the validity of the hearing. Any procedural errors which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties shall be disregarded. The council may order the city clerk to issue and the chief of police or his representative to serve subpoenas for any witnesses or records necessary for the production of evidence at any duly scheduled public hearing as provided for herein. Any person, other than a member of the council, who wishes to direct question(s) to an opposing speaker shall submit such question(s) to the presiding officer, who will ask the question(s) to the speaker. The presiding officer may, at his discretion, restrict the number and nature of any questions asked pursuant to this section.

B. If there is a staff report, it shall be considered as evidence and shall become part of the record of a public hearing. Such report need not be read in full as part of the staff presentation. A synopsis of such report may be presented orally by staff members to the council. In addition, any of the following may be presented to the city council and, if presented, shall also become part of the record:

1. Exhibits and documents used by the city staff and any persons participating in the hearing;

2. Maps and displays presented for use at the hearing; provided, that whenever practicable, they shall be displayed in full view of the participants and the audience;

3. All communications and petitions concerning the subject matter of the hearing; provided, that a reading of such matters only shall be had at the request of a council member,

4. Information obtained outside of the council hearing, such as a view of property; provided, such information, or a conversation with persons in the neighborhood, shall be disclosed for the record during the hearing.

C. All exhibits, reports, maps and other physical evidence placed before the council shall be retained by the city clerk or the appropriate department head, as public records. Such exhibits may be released by the clerk with the approval of the city attorney. (Ord. 31 § 2, 1987; 1987 Code § 2.18.190)


2.04.240 Public hearing – Continuation.

At any time that it appears to the presiding officer or a majority of the council through the presiding officer, that inadequate evidence has been presented to afford judicious consideration of any matter before the council at the time of a public hearing, or for other just cause, a continuation of said hearing may be ordered to afford the applicant, his opponents, or the city staff adequate time to assemble additional evidence for the council’s consideration. Any continuation ordered by the council through its presiding officer shall be to a date certain, which said date shall be publicly announced in the council chamber and shall constitute notice to the public of the time and place that further evidence will be taken. The public announcements provided for herein shall constitute notice to all persons of time and place when further evidence will be taken by the council. The council shall also have the option to set the matter for a new hearing. (Ord. 31 § 2, 1987; 1987 Code § 2.18.200)


2.04.250 Public hearing – Closing.

When neither the applicant, his opponents, or the city staff have further evidence to produce or when in the opinion of the presiding officer or the majority of the council through the presiding officer sufficient evidence has been presented, the presiding officer shall order the public hearing closed, at which time no further evidence, either oral or written, will be accepted by the council; provided, however, that this rule may be relaxed by the presiding officer where it appears that good cause exists to hear further evidence concerning the matter which is the subject of the public hearing. (Ord. 31 § 2, 1987; 1987 Code § 2.18.210)


2.04.260 Public hearing – Reopening.

A public hearing on any matter once closed cannot be reopened on the date set for hearing unless the presiding officer determines that all persons who were present when the hearing closed are still present. Nothing herein, however, is intended to prevent or prohibit the reopening of a public hearing at any subsequent regular or special meeting of the council. No public hearing may be reopened without due and proper notice being given to the applicant and his opponents, designating the time and place of said reopening.

Upon return of such documents, the council shall determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence before them at the hearing and if the decision is supported by the findings and after making any changes render their decision by taking action on the documents. The city council’s decision is not final until adoption of the documents.

A. Emergency purchases are required as provided in SBMC 3.08.060.

B. If the purchasing officer finds that such supplies, services or equipment are unique because of the quality, durability, availability or fitness for a particular use or if available from only one source, competitive bidding will not be required.

C. The goods, services, and/or equipment may be acquired from or in cooperation with another governmental agency that is acquiring or has acquired goods, services, and/or equipment through a cooperative purchasing plan or program which accomplishes the purposes of this chapter in accordance with state law and when economically advantageous to do so, including, but not limited to, another governmental agency with which the city has entered into a joint exercise of powers agreement for such purpose, pursuant to the provisions of Section 6502 of the Government Code of the State of California, provided both of the following conditions apply:

1. The sales price of the item to be purchased has been obtained through the competitive bidding process conducted within a previous 24-month period, by the other agency; and

2. The purchase can be made by the other governmental agency upon the same terms, conditions, and specifications at a lower price than can be obtained by the city through normal purchasing procedures.

3.08.140 Contracts for professional services.

Because of their unique nature, it is in the best interest of the public, as allowed by state law, that contracts for professional services such as attorneys, accountants, architects, planning consultants, computer consultants, engineers, auditors, financial advisors, public relations consultants, real estate agents and brokers, insurance and bond agents and brokers, or other professional or consultant services of a similar nature, or at the discretion of the purchasing officer, be selected on the basis of demonstrated competence and on the professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required, negotiated between parties rather than on the basis of cost alone. Therefore, the city manager is not limited to awarding professional services contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, but rather on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the types of service to be performed at a fair and reasonable price.

The procurement of professional services shall be as follows:

A. The city manager may exempt professional service contracts from the bid requirements of SBMC 3.08.070 for contracts less than $25,000 when it is necessary or convenient for the management of the city’s affairs.

B. The purchasing officer shall ascertain from informed sources the names of not less than three professionals qualified for the service desired who are professionally and financially qualified to undertake the proposed assignment. When three such professionals are not readily identifiable, the city manager may determine that a lesser number of professionals is adequate.

C. A request for proposal shall be provided to all potential candidates outlining the scope of services required, time frame for completion, pricing structure, liability insurance information and coverage and other pertinent information. Professionals must submit their responses in the specified format no later than the stated final due date for proposals. The response must include liability insurance information and coverage.

D. The evaluation process will be based on the criteria stated in the request for proposal but will generally include the scope of services offered, the professional’s capabilities and previous experience in the field.

E. After the proposals are evaluated, the purchasing officer will negotiate an agreement with the selected professional. If an agreement is not reached within a reasonable time, the purchasing officer will terminate discussion with the first candidate and open negotiations with the second choice.

(Ord. 293 § 3, 2002)

3.36.030 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:

A. “Hotel” means any structure or any portion of any structure which has three or more units occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, including any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof.

B. “Occupancy” means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, living or sleeping purposes.

C. “Operator” means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent, or any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

D. “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

E. “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel, valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

F. “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy; provided, that any person who actually occupies the same premises for a period of 31 or more consecutive days shall be deemed exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter on that specific occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.030)


3.36.040 Collection of tax.

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. A duplicate receipt shall be kept by the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. If the operator collects the rent but fails to collect the tax for any reason, the operator shall be responsible for paying the tax. (Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.040)


3.36.045 Rent surcharge, exemption from tax.

An operator may establish a rent surcharge in an amount not to exceed $0.50. The surcharge shall not be deemed to be rent pursuant to SBMC 3.36.030(E) and shall not be subject to taxation under this chapter if all of the following requirements are met:

A. The surcharge is separately stated from the room rent and the tax on the receipt required by SBMC 3.36.040;

Such certificate shall, among other things, state:

A. The name of the operator;

B. The address of the hotel;

C. The date upon which the certificate is issued; and

D. The following:

This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the City Manager for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the City Manager. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in any unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This Certificate does not constitute a permit. It is unlawful to operate a hotel in the City without a currently valid Certificate.

(Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.050)


3.36.060 Reporting and remitting collections.

Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month, make a return to the city manager, on forms provided by the city, of the total rents charged and received, and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies during the previous month. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the city manager. The city manager may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the city manager. (Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.060)

A. If an operator who is liable for any tax or penalties under this chapter sells or otherwise disposes of his business, his successor shall notify the tax administrator of the date of sale and withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase price to equal the amount of such tax or penalty until the selling operator produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that the tax or penalty has been paid, or a tax clearance certificate from the tax administrator stating that no tax or penalty is due. If the seller does not present a receipt or tax clearance within 30 days after such successor commences to conduct business, the successor shall deposit the withheld amount with the tax administrator pending settlement of the account of the seller.

B. If the successor to the business fails to withhold a portion of the purchase price as required, he shall be liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld. Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the successor for a tax clearance certificate stating that no tax or penalty is due, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the successor at his address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the estimated amount of the tax and penalty that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate.

C. Audit Deficiency. If, upon audit by the city, an operator is found to be deficient in his return or his remittance or both, the tax administrator shall immediately invoice the operator for the amount of the net deficiency plus a penalty of 10 percent of the net deficiency. If the operator fails or refuses to pay the deficient amount and applicable penalties within 14 days of the date of the invoice, an additional penalty shall be imposed at the rate of one percent per day of the net deficiency, not to exceed 10 percent.

D. Fraud. If the city manager determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to the penalties in subsections A and B of this section.

E. Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

G. Revocation. In addition to the other penalties provided by this section, if an operator is delinquent in any way more than one time in any 12-month period, the tax administrator may revoke the operator’s transient occupancy registration certificate. (Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.080)


3.36.090 Failure to collect – Penalties – Hearing.

If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such a manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may, within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed on the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator to be due, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in SBMC 3.36.100. (Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.090)

The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.100)


3.36.110 Records and inspection.

(Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.110)


3.36.120 Refunds.

A. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section; provided, that a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, shall be filed with the city manager within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the city manager.

B. Any operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the city manager that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the city manager, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the city manager that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who has collected the tax.

D. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.120)


3.36.130 Action to recover unpaid tax.

(Ord. 44 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 3.16.130)

C. Any person required by this chapter to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due pursuant to this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by fine not exceeding $500.00 or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both such fine and imprisonment.

If the respondent does not testify on his own behalf, the respondent may be called and examined as if under cross-examination.

C. The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil actions; and irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

The proponent of any testimony to be offered by a witness who does not proficiently speak the English language shall provide an interpreter, approved by the hearing officer conducting the proceeding as proficient in the English language and the language in which the witness will testify, to serve as interpreter during the hearing. The cost of the interpreter shall be paid by the party providing the interpreter. The city council may compile and publish a list of interpreters known to be proficient in various languages.

4.36.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to subject security alarm systems to reasonable regulation to protect the safety and welfare of the residents of the city from adverse impacts caused by false alarms. Whenever public safety personnel respond to false alarms there is a waste of limited public safety resources and an unnecessary expenditure of tax dollars. This chapter is intended to encourage alarm system operators and users to maintain alarm systems in a manner that prevents false alarms, to establish a procedure for the abatement of nuisances resulting from false alarms and establish civil and criminal penalties for the improper maintenance and use of alarm systems. It is the further purpose of this chapter to replace existing regulations established by the county of San Diego Code of Regulatory Ordinances and adopted by reference by city ordinance. (Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)

No person or entity shall conduct business as an alarm system service provider unless the person or entity has complied with the provisions of Chapter 4.02 SBMC.

D. “Alarm user” means the person who has possession and control of an alarm system for a premises. A person providing alarm monitoring or response services shall not be deemed to be an alarm user with respect to an alarm system located on the premises of another alarm user to whom the person provides such services pursuant to a contract. For residential property, the owner of the property as shown on the last equalized assessment roll shall be presumed to be the alarm user. A residential owner may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that a tenant has possession and control of the alarm system. For nonresidential property, the owner of the property as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and the property manager (if any) shall be presumed to be the alarm user. A nonresidential property owner or property manager may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that a tenant has possession and control of the alarm system.

E. “City manager” means the Solana Beach city manager or such other person to whom the city manager has delegated authority to hear and decide appeals under this chapter.

F. “City public safety service provider” means the Solana Beach fire department, the county of San Diego Community Service Area 17, and the San Diego County sheriff’s department.

G. “Day” means calendar day.

An activation of an alarm system that does not result in the transmission of an emergency response request to a city public service safety provider shall not be considered to be a false alarm. (Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)


4.36.030 Excessive false alarms.

Excessive false alarms are any false alarms in excess of three within any 365-day period. The number of false alarms within a 365-day period shall be determined by starting on the day immediately preceding the day of the false alarm in question and counting backwards 365 days, including the three hundred sixty-fifth day.

2. One hundred dollars for the second excessive false alarm;

3. One hundred fifty dollars for the third and each successive excessive false alarm.

B. Civil penalties may be assessed by the issuance of a notice of violation by any person authorized to enforce the provisions of this code. A notice of violation may be served on an alarm user personal service or by first class mail, postage prepaid and sent to the alarm user at the address of the property where the alarm is located, or at the address shown on the last equalized property tax assessment roll.

C. A notice of violation shall contain a statement giving notice to the alarm user of the user’s right to request a hearing before the fire chief or such other hearing officer as may be designated by the city manager.

A request for a hearing shall be made in writing filed with the city clerk not later than the date stated on the notice of violation, which date shall be no sooner than 10 days following personal delivery of the notice of violation or 15 days from the date the notice is placed in the mail.

D. A late payment penalty of 15 percent will be added to any penalty not paid within 30 days of the specified due date. A late penalty of 25 percent will be added to any penalty not paid within 60 days of the specified due date. Any penalty which remains unpaid 75 days following the specified due date will be forwarded to the city manager, who shall collect the unpaid penalty by use of all appropriate legal means, including referral to the city attorney. (Ord. 342 §§ 1, 2, 3, 2005; Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)


4.36.050 Abatement.

Any alarm system that results in excessive false alarms is a public nuisance. As a cumulative remedy to the civil penalty imposed in SBMC 4.36.040, the public nuisance resulting from an alarm system may be abated according to the procedures established by Chapter 6.04 SBMC or any other procedure established by state statute for the abatement of public nuisances. (Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)


4.36.060 Criminal penalty.

4.36.070 Alarm system standards and restrictions.

A. Fire alarm systems shall be Underwriters Laboratory approved and conform to the requirements of the Uniform Fire Code or other regulations of the State Fire Marshal.

C. Alarm systems that directly dial any telephone number of the city of Solana Beach, the North County Dispatch Joint Powers Authority, the San Diego County sheriff’s department or 911, are prohibited.

D. The city fire marshal, code compliance officer, or building director (or person serving in that capacity by virtue of a contract), or a deputy or other authorized employee of the county sheriff, may issue an order of correction to an alarm user whose system results in excessive false alarms. An order of correction may be given in connection with a notice of violation. An order of correction shall specify the correction or corrections required and allow a reasonable time to complete the work. (Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)


4.36.080 Alarm system testing.

Alarm system testing shall be done by an alarm system service provider or by an alarm user after notification to the user’s alarm system service provider. (Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)


4.36.090 Limitation on liability.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create any duty of the city of Solana Beach, the county of San Diego, the North County Dispatch Joint Powers Agency, the County Service Area 17, or any officer, employee or agent of any of these agencies to respond to any alarm or other emergency. (Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)


4.36.100 Exemptions.

B. Activation of an alarm system caused by a malfunction of a telephone line circuit, earthquake or natural catastrophic condition does not constitute a false alarm.

C. The alarm user shall have the burden of establishing the applicability of an exemption. (Ord. 242 § 1, 1998)1

4.45.010 Purpose and intent.

Wholesale food warehouses are not adequately regulated by the state of California. Recent inspections of some of these warehouses by the county of San Diego have revealed rodent infestations, mishandling of recalled food, and other conditions that could lead to foodborne illness. The county has responded to these problems by enacting Ordinance No. 9525 (New Series), which established a mandatory permit program, a permit fee, and regulatory requirements applicable to wholesale food warehouses.

The food stored in wholesale food warehouses is frequently distributed across city boundaries. An effective regional food warehouse permitting and regulatory program requires enactment of a regulatory ordinance in this city that parallels the county ordinance, and cooperation between the city and the county to implement that ordinance. (Ord. 306 § 1, 2003)


4.45.020 County enforcement of city ordinance.

The city has an agreement in place with the county that provides for certain services related to public health and sanitation to be provided by the county within the city. The city desires that the county also implement the permitting and regulatory program established by this chapter. The city manager is authorized to enter into any supplemental or modified agreement with the county that may be needed to effect this purpose. (Ord. 306 § 2, 2003)


4.45.030 Adoption of county ordinance.

The provisions of the County Code of Regulatory Ordinances concerning permitting and regulation of wholesale food warehouses, codified at Sections 61.211 through 61.256 of the County Code, are incorporated into this code by reference. (Ord. 411 § 25, 2010; Ord. 306 § 3, 2003)


4.45.040 Fees.

The county shall retain all fees and charges collected by it from regulated wholesale food warehouse owners or operators pursuant to this code. (Ord. 306 § 4, 2003)1

A. It shall be unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter for each location at which that activity is to occur.

B. No license may issue to authorize tobacco retailing at any location. For example, tobacco retailing by persons on foot and tobacco retailing from vehicles are prohibited.

C. No license may issue to authorize tobacco retailing at any location that is licensed under state law to serve alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises (e.g., an “on-sale” license issued by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control) and no license may issue to authorize tobacco retailing at any location offering food for sale for consumption by guests on the premises. For example, tobacco retailing in bars and restaurants is prohibited.

D. The license fee established pursuant to SBMC 6.17.060 confers paid status upon a license for a term of one year. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer’s license no later than 30 days prior to expiration of the payment term.

E. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer’s license any status or right other than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city identified on the face of the license. For example, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of any other provision of applicable law, including, without limitation, any condition or limitation on smoking in enclosed places of employment made applicable to business establishments by California Labor Code section 6404.5. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)


6.17.030 Application procedure.

A. Application for tobacco retailer’s license shall be submitted in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof. It is the responsibility of each proprietor to be informed of the laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer’s license. A license that is issued in error or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor may be revoked pursuant to SBMC 6.17.090(C). All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the department and shall contain the following information:

1. The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor.

2. The business name, address, and telephone number of the single fixed location for which a tobacco retailer’s license is sought.

3. The name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to receive all license-related communications and notices (the “authorized address”). If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified in subsection (A)(2) of this section.

4. Whether or not any proprietor has previously been issued a license pursuant to this chapter that is, or was at any time, suspended or revoked and, if so, the dates of the suspension period or the date of revocation.

5. Such other information as the department deems necessary for the administration or enforcement of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)


6.17.040 Issuance of license.

Upon the receipt of an application for a tobacco retailer’s license and the license fee, the department shall issue a license unless substantial record evidence demonstrates one of the following bases for denial:

A. The application is incomplete or inaccurate; or

B. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing by a proprietor for which or whom a suspension is in effect pursuant to SBMC 6.17.090; or

C. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing by a proprietor for which or whom a suspension is in effect pursuant to SBMC 6.17.090; or at a location which has had a license revoked pursuant to SBMC 6.17.090(A)(4); provided, however, this subsection shall not constitute a basis for denial of a license if the applicant provides the city with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the premises or business in an arm’s length transaction. For the purposes of this subsection, an “arm’s length transaction” is defined as a sale in good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open market between two informed and willing parties, neither under any compulsion to participate in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or a sale for the primary purpose of avoiding the effect of the violations of this chapter that occurred at the location, is presumed not to be an “arm’s length transaction”;

D. The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to SBMC 6.17.020 (e.g., mobile vending), or that is unlawful pursuant to any other local, state, or federal law. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)


6.17.050 Other requirements and prohibitions.

A. Display of License. Each license shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the licensed premises.

B. Positive Identification Required. No person shall engage in tobacco retailing without first examining the identification of the purchaser, if the purchaser reasonably appears under the age of 27 years old, and confirming that the proposed sale is to a purchaser who is at least the minimum age in state law for being sold the tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia.

C. Minimum Age for Persons Selling Tobacco. No person shall engage in tobacco retailing if the person is younger than the minimum age in state law for being sold or for possessing any tobacco product. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)


6.17.060 Fees for license.

The fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer’s license shall be established by resolution of the city council. The fee shall be calculated so as to recover the total cost of both license administration and license enforcement, including, for example, issuing the license, administering the license program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violations, and prosecution of violators, but shall not exceed the cost of the total program. All fees shall be used to fund the program. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)


6.17.070 Licenses nontransferable.

A tobacco retailer’s license is nontransferable. If the information required in the license application pursuant to SBMC 6.17.030(A)(1), (2), or (3) changes, a new tobacco retailer’s license is required before the business may continue to act as a tobacco retailer. For example, if a proprietor to whom a license has been issued changes business location, that proprietor must apply for a new license prior to acting as a tobacco retailer at the new location. Or if the business is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that location before acting as a tobacco retailer. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)


6.17.080 License violation and compliance monitoring.

A. Violation of Tobacco-Related Laws. It shall be a violation of a tobacco retailer’s license for a licensee or his or her agent or employee to violate any local, state, or federal tobacco-related law.

B. License Compliance Monitoring.

1. Compliance with this chapter shall be monitored by the department. Any peace officer or code enforcement official also may enforce this chapter.

2. The department shall check the compliance of each tobacco retailer at least one time per 12-month period and shall conduct additional compliance checks within that period as warranted. The compliance checks shall be conducted to determine, at a minimum, if the tobacco retailer is complying with tobacco laws regulating underage sales. The department, or the police department, in assisting the department in performing compliance checks, shall use youth decoys and comply with protocols for the compliance checks developed in consultation with the San Diego County department of health and human services and the San Diego County district attorney. When appropriate, the compliance checks shall determine compliance with other tobacco-related laws.

3. The city shall not enforce any tobacco-related minimum-age law against a person who otherwise might be in violation of such law because of the person’s age (hereinafter “youth decoy”) if the potential violation occurs when:

 a. The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by a peace officer or a code enforcement official; or

 b. The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check funded in part by the San Diego County department of health and human services or funded in part, either directly or indirectly through subcontracting, by the California Department of Health Services. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)


6.17.090 Suspension or revocation of license.

A. Suspension or Revocation of License for Violation. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer’s license shall be suspended or revoked if the department finds, after notice to the licensee and opportunity to be heard, that the licensee or his or her agents or employees has or have violated the requirements or prohibitions of this chapter including the conditions of the license imposed pursuant to SBMC 6.17.080.

1. Upon a finding by the department of a first license violation within any 60-month period, the license shall be suspended for 30 days unless, at the election of the tobacco retailer, the tobacco retailer pays an administrative fine in accordance with SBMC 6.17.110(C). The payment of a fine in lieu of suspension does not expunge the violation and the violation will be counted for the purposes of a future finding that a second or subsequent violation has occurred.

2. Upon a finding by the department of a second license violation within any 60-month period, the license shall be suspended for 90 days and (if the violation occurs within 12 months of the first violation) the tobacco retailer shall be fined an administrative fine for a second violation in accordance with SBMC 6.17.110(C).

3. Upon a finding by the department of a third license violation within any 60-month period, the license shall be suspended for one year and (if the violation occurs within 12 months of the first violation) the tobacco retailer shall be fined an administrative fine for a third violation in accordance with SBMC 6.17.110(C).

4. Upon a finding by the department of a fourth license violation within any 60-month period, the license shall be revoked, if the violation occurs within 12 months of the first violation the tobacco retailer shall be fined an administrative fine for a fourth violation in accordance with SBMC 6.17.110(C), and the proprietor or proprietors who had been issued the license shall never again be issued a tobacco retailer’s license pursuant to this chapter.

5. A tobacco retailer with a suspended or revoked license:

a. Shall remove all tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia from public view; and

b. Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of such products at the tobacco retailer location or that would lead a reasonable consumer to believe that such products can be obtained at the tobacco retailer location, including any use of the terms, “tobacco,” or “smoke shop,” or similar references in the name of the business operated by the tobacco retailer;

c. Except that for a first or second suspension within any 60-month period, instead of complying with subsections (A)(5)(a) and (A)(5)(b) of this section, the tobacco retailer may elect to post a clear and legible sign at each point of sale and at every public entrance stating in 72 point type or larger: “TOBACCO PRODUCTS NOT FOR SALE because this store has violated a public health law regulating tobacco” and such signs must be present and remain free of obstructions for the entire duration of the suspension period.

B. Suspension of License for Failure to Pay Renewal Fee. A tobacco retailer’s license that is not timely renewed pursuant to SBMC 6.17.020(D) shall automatically be suspended by operation of law. If not renewed, a license shall be automatically revoked two years after the renewal date. To reinstate the paid status of a license that has been suspended due to the failure to timely pay the renewal fee, the proprietor must:

1. Submit the renewal fee plus a reinstatement fee of 10 percent of the renewal fee; and

2. Submit a signed affidavit affirming that the proprietor has not sold any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia during the period the license was suspended for failure to pay the renewal fee.

The revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new application for a license.

A copy of the notice of appeal to the superior court shall be timely served in person or by first-class mail upon the department by the contestant. The appeal shall be heard de novo, except that the contents of the department’s file in the case shall be received in evidence. A copy of the records of the department of the notices of the violation and of the hearing officer’s decision and findings shall be admitted into evidence as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

C. Failure to Pay Fine. If no timely notice of appeal to the superior court is filed, or the department is not timely served with a copy of a notice of appeal, the hearing officer’s decision and findings shall be deemed confirmed and the fine shall be collected pursuant to SBMC 1.18.110. (Ord. 403 § 11, 2009)

6.20.010 Purpose and intent. 

The city council hereby finds and determines that the storage, accumulation, collection and disposal of garbage, trash, litter, rubbish, debris and other discarded matter, goods and materials is a matter of great public concern, in that improper control of such matters creates a public nuisance, can lead to air pollution, fire hazards, illegal dumping, insect breeding and rat infestation and other conditions affecting the health, welfare and safety of the residents of this and surrounding cities. The city council further finds that the periodic collection of garbage, rubbish and other refuse and recyclable material from all residences and places of business in the city benefits all occupants of residences within the city and, therefore, the occupants as hereinafter defined are made liable for the payment of fees for the mandatory service as may be from time to time approved by city council resolution.

B. The city council finds and determines that the periodic collection of garbage, rubbish and other refuse as provided herein, from all residences and places of business in the city benefits all occupants of property within the city; therefore, all occupants shall dispose of solid waste through the regular solid waste collection service, or recycling service, or a provider permitted by this chapter and shall be liable for the payment to the city, or to the franchisee, of solid waste collection charges including charges for franchised recycling services as may from time to time be approved by the city council.

C. Every occupant of the city shall be billed periodically for the charges established pursuant to this chapter. Should any person fail, refuse or neglect to pay such bill within 30 days after the day that the same is rendered, then a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the bill may be added to the bill and the sum, together with any costs incurred by the franchisee, may be recovered by the franchisee, as required by law.

D. Should the occupant of any property fail or refuse to pay the charge established in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, then the franchisee shall advise the city manager of such refusal. The failure to pay may, except for the provisions hereof, result in the noncollection of garbage, rubbish and other refuse, which condition the city council determines and declares to be a threat to the public health, safety and welfare, and which condition is declared to be, if permitted to exist, a public nuisance. In the event that there is nonpayment, the city manager shall direct the franchisee to make collection, and the expenses and charges of collection, including penalties, may be assessed against the property as provided by law or otherwise collected by the city. The franchisee shall continue to collect garbage, rubbish and other refuse when directed to do so by the city manager even though there is nonpayment.

E. All costs incurred by the city and paid by the city to the collector or franchisee shall be recoverable by the city and charged against the property from which the garbage, rubbish or other refuse was collected. The city manager shall notify all parties concerned of the cost of any such collection by directing a letter to the occupant of the property at the address shown on the latest tax roll. Any such notice shall be given 10 days prior to a public hearing and city council shall review and approve an assessment against the property for the costs incurred in abating the public nuisance. If the total assessment determined and confirmed by the city council is not paid within 10 days after the determination by the city council, then there shall be recorded in the office of the city recorder a statement of the total balance due, together with the legal description of the property affected. From and after the date of such recording, the balance due shall be a special assessment against the parcel plus a $30.00 city administrative fee. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and to the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of county taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment. (Ord. 177 § 1, 1993)

The WMP compliance official shall not approve a WMP unless it meets the following conditions:

1. Provides all of the information set forth in SBMC 6.36.030; and

2. Indicates that at least 50 percent of all C&D debris generated by the project will be diverted. 

Upon determining that the above conditions have been met, the WMP compliance official shall mark the WMP “Approved” and notify the community development department.

B. Nonapproval. If the WMP compliance official determines that the WMP is incomplete or fails to indicate that at least 50 percent of all C&D debris generated by the project will be reused or recycled, he or she shall:

1. Contact the applicant to discuss the WMP, make recommendations for additional diversion, and obtain and note verbal confirmation from the applicant of changes to the WMP that would meet the requirements of this chapter; or

A. Documentation. Prior to final building approval, the applicant shall submit to the WMP compliance official documentation that the diversion requirement for the project has been met. If the applicant does not submit the required documentation, he or she may be subject to an administrative penalty and/or enforcement action pursuant to SBMC 6.36.070.

1. Copies of receipts from the vendor or facility that collected or received each material, showing the actual weight of that material.

B. Weighing of Wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all C&D debris diverted or landfilled is measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all C&D debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For C&D debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates.

C. Determination of Compliance and Assessment of an Administrative Penalty.

1. Full Compliance. If the WMP compliance official determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement for the project, he or she shall approve the final WMP report.

2. Good Faith Effort to Comply. If the WMP compliance official determines that the diversion requirement has not been achieved, he or she shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply. The WMP compliance official shall consider the availability of markets for the C&D debris landfilled, the size of the project, and the documented efforts of the applicant to divert C&D debris. If the WMP compliance official determines that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, he or she may approve the final WMP report or assess an administrative penalty. Any penalty assessed must be paid to the city prior to final building approval.

3. Noncompliance. If the WMP compliance official determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with the diversion requirement applicable to the project, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by subsection A of this section, then the applicant shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of SBMC 6.36.070. Any penalty assessed must be paid to the city prior to final building approval. 

4. Noncompliance Notification and Appeal. Upon a determination of noncompliance, the WMP compliance official shall notify the applicant of the WMP report findings. The notice shall be in writing and shall identify the specific area(s) of noncompliance with the WMP and inform the applicant that it has a right to a hearing to appeal the determination. The request for a hearing must be made in writing and received by the WMP compliance official no later than the city’s close of business on the seventh calendar day from the mailing date (as determined by postmark) of the noncompliance notice. The hearing shall be held no earlier than 10 calendar days and no later than 30 calendar days following the receipt of the written request for hearing. The city manager or his or her designee shall serve as the hearing officer. The applicant shall be permitted to submit evidence. The rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing officer may consider any relevant evidence. The applicant shall not be entitled to cross-examine any witnesses. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the decision of the hearing officer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the decision of the hearing officer shall be final.

Any penalty assessed must be paid to the city prior to final building approval. (Ord. 377 § 2, 2008)


6.36.060 Exemption.

A. Application. If unique circumstances make it infeasible for an applicant for a covered project to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the required WMP. The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific unique circumstances that make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement.

B. Meeting with WMP Compliance Official. The WMP compliance official shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement.

C. Granting of Exemption. The WMP compliance official shall not issue an infeasibility exemption unless he or she can make at least one of the following findings:

1. That circumstances exist that are unique to the project to the effect that compliance with the provisions of this chapter would create an unusual burden on the project that is different than that of similarly situated properties.

2. That for a specific project compliance with this chapter would result in minimal or no increase in recycled materials or reduction in waste stream.

3. That diversion of one or more substances involved in the project presents unique and burdensome obstacles and would create an especially onerous economic burden on the project unless diversion of that substance is reduced or eliminated.

If the WMP compliance official is able to make one or more of the above findings for a project, he or she may excuse the project from compliance with this chapter or determine the maximum feasible reduced diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the WMP submitted by the applicant. The WMP compliance official shall return a copy of the WMP to the applicant marked “Approved for Exemption” and shall notify the community development department.

D. Denial of Exemption. If the WMP compliance official is unable to make any of the findings required by subsection C of this section, the applicant shall be informed in writing. The applicant shall have 30 days to resubmit a WMP form in full compliance with SBMC 6.36.030. If the applicant fails to resubmit the WMP, or if the resubmitted WMP does not comply with SBMC 6.36.030, the WMP compliance official shall deny the WMP in accordance with SBMC 6.36.050. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the determination of the WMP compliance officer shall be final. (Ord. 377 § 2, 2008)


6.36.070 Enforcement.

A. Criminal Action. Any applicant who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. However, any such violation constituting a misdemeanor may, in the discretion of the attorney having prosecutorial functions, be charged and prosecuted as an infraction.

B. Civil Action. The city may redress a violation of, or failure to comply with, any provision of this chapter by civil action, in addition or as an alternative to criminal enforcement. If the city shall prevail in any such civil action, it shall be entitled to attorney fees.

C. Administrative Penalty. Any applicant who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter may also be assessed an administrative penalty. The amount of the penalty may be up to $1,000. The WMP compliance official upon determining noncompliance with this chapter shall notify the applicant of the penalty assessed against it. The notice shall be in writing and shall identify the specific noncompliance, the amount of the penalty assessed, and inform the applicant that it has a right to a hearing to appeal the validity or amount of the penalty. The request for a hearing must be made in writing and received by the WMP compliance official no later than the city’s close of business on the seventh calendar day from the mailing date (as determined by postmark) of the penalty notice. The hearing shall be held no later than 10 days following the receipt by the WMP compliance official of the written request for hearing. The city manager or his or her designee shall serve as the hearing officer. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the decision of the hearing officer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the decision of the hearing officer shall be final. Any penalty assessed must be paid to the city prior to final building approval.

By enacting curfew regulations which apply to minors and parents of minors, the city council intends to preserve and promote the peace of the community, as well as the safety and welfare of minors, during the late night hours. The city council also recognizes that such regulations must protect the public interest without infringing upon certain fundamental rights of minors and their parents. This curfew measure is intended to reach a reasonable balance between said interests. Such balance is achieved by application of the principle that parental responsibility for the conduct of a minor is paramount to the exercise of regulatory authority by the city. Only in the absence of the exercise of parental authority over a minor will the enforcement of this curfew measure become necessary. (Ord. 235 § 1, 1997)

7.16.050 Enforcement – Penalty.

A. Before taking any enforcement action, the deputy sheriff shall determine the apparent offender’s age and reason for being in a public place or on the premises of the establishment during curfew hours. The deputy sheriff shall not issue a citation or make an arrest under this section unless the deputy sheriff reasonably believes an offense has occurred and, based on any responses and other circumstances, no defense under SBMC 7.16.045 is applicable.

B. Each violation of SBMC 7.16.030 or 7.16.040 constitutes a separate offense and may be prosecuted either as a misdemeanor or infraction as provided under SBMC Title 1.

A. Any interested person requiring terminal access for interstate trucks from the federally designated highway system shall submit an application, on a form as provided by the city, together with such information as may be required by the city engineer, and appropriate fees, to the city.

B. Upon receipt of the application, the city engineer will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal facility meets the requirements for an interstate truck terminal. Upon the city engineer’s approval of that designation, the city engineer will then determine the capability of the route requested, and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination of route capability will include, without limitation, a review of adequate turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections and highways and general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed and traffic volumes. No access off a federally designated highway system will be approved without the approval of Caltrans.

Trailblazer signs will be required at every decision point in the city en route to the terminal. Upon completion of the installation of the signs, the actual cost shall be computed and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required are in place. (Ord. 37 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 7.43.040)

C. If, at any time within five years from the date of completion of the retrofitting by the applicant, any new applicant should seek approval of a terminal which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, the new applicant may be required to pay a fee to the city equal to the proportionate share of the cost of the previously completed retrofitting, as determined by the city engineer, which fee shall be disbursed by the city to the applicant who paid for the retrofitting, as well as to any applicant who contributed to the cost of retrofitting under this subsection. Nothing in this chapter shall require the payment of a proportionate fee if the applicant doing the work failed to file the report with the city engineer required by subsection B of this section. (Ord. 37 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 7.43.050)


10.52.060 Revocation of route.

The city engineer may revoke any approved terminal or route if the terminal or route becomes a safety hazard for vehicular traffic. A safety hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate the route or such vehicles causing unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic or pedestrians. (Ord. 37 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 7.43.060)


10.52.070 Appeal process.

A. If the city engineer denies terminal designation or route feasibility, or revokes a previously approved terminal or route, the applicant/terminal owner, within 10 days following the date of receipt of the decision of the city engineer, may appeal the decision to the city council in writing. An appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the department of public works and shall be filed with the city clerk. The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or abuse of discretion by the city engineer or wherein the decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. Within five days of the filing of an appeal, the city engineer shall transmit to the city clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route and all other data filed therewith, the report of the city engineer, the findings of the city engineer and his decision on the application.

B. The city clerk shall make copies of the data provided by the city engineer available to the applicant and to the appellant, if the applicant is not the appellant, for inspection and may give notice to any other interested party who requested notice of the time when the appeal will be considered by the city council.

This chapter is not intended to limit that authority of the city as set forth in Chapter 10 of the California Vehicle Code, commencing with Section 22650 thereof, but is intended to supplement that authority. (Ord. 37 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 7.52.030)

Article II. Removal and Disposal of Abandoned Vehicles Not on Highways


10.64.040 Purpose and intent.

The purpose and intent of the council in adopting this article is to establish procedures pursuant to Sections 22660 to 22664 of the California Vehicle Code for the abatement, removal and disposal as public nuisances, of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or vehicle parts from private or public property, not including highways. (Ord. 37 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 7.52.040)


10.64.050 Removal and disposal procedures.

Any vehicle located on property other than a highway may be removed as a public nuisance and disposed of in accordance with the following procedures:

A. Not less than 10 days prior to any removal or disposal of a vehicle, a notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle as a public nuisance shall be issued, unless the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle. The notice shall contain a statement of the hearing rights of the owner of the vehicle and of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located. The statement shall include notice to the property owner that he may appear in person at a hearing or may submit a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons for such denial, in lieu of appearing. The notice of intention to abate shall be mailed, by registered or certified mail, to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owners of record, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.

B. Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located, a public hearing shall be held before the city manager or any other regularly salaried full-time employee of the city whom the city manager may designate. This request shall be made to the manager or his designee within 10 days after the mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle.

C. The owner of the land on which the vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing. Instead of making an appearance, he may present a sworn written statement, in time for consideration at the hearing, denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons for his denial. This statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting the request. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner, and that he has not acquiesced in its presence, then the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle shall not be assessed against the property upon which the vehicle is located, pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5, or collected from the landowner.

D. No person shall reconstruct or make operable any vehicle removed under the provisions of this article, unless it is a vehicle which qualifies for either horseless carriage license plates or historical vehicle license, pursuant to Section 5004 of the California Vehicle Code, in which case the vehicle may be reconstructed or made operable.

E. This article shall not apply to:

1. A vehicle which is completely enclosed within a building in a lawful manner where it is not visible from the street or other public or private property; or

2. A vehicle which is stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer or a junk yard. 

This exception shall not, however, authorize the maintenance of a public or private nuisance, as defined under provisions of law other than this section.

F. A vehicle may be disposed of by removal to a scrap yard, automobile dismantler’s yard, or any suitable site for processing as scrap, or other final disposition consistent with subsection D of this section.

G. Notice shall be given to the Department of Motor Vehicles within five days after the date of removal, identifying the vehicle and any evidence of registration available including, but not limited to, the registration card, certificate of ownership or license plates.

H. The cost of removal and disposal of any vehicle and the administrative cost thereof may be charged against the person who is determined to be responsible for the maintenance of the vehicle as a public nuisance.

I. Provisions of this section shall be administered by regularly salaried full-time employees of the city except that the removal of vehicles from the property may be by any other duly authorized person. Any such authorized person may enter upon private property for the purposes specified in this section to examine a vehicle, and remove or cause to be removed the vehicle declared to be a nuisance pursuant to this section.

J. Any licensed dismantler or commercial enterprise acquiring vehicles removed pursuant to this section shall be excused from the reporting requirements of Section 11520 of the California Vehicle Code; and any fees and penalties which would otherwise be due the Department of Motor Vehicles are waived; provided that a copy of the resolution or order authorizing disposition of the vehicle is retained in the dismantler’s or commercial enterprise’s business records. (Ord. 37 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 7.52.050)


Chapter 10.68 REPAIR OF VEHICLES

Sections:

10.68.010    Vehicle repair prohibited – Exceptions.


10.68.010 Vehicle repair prohibited – Exceptions.

A. No person shall repair, assemble or dismantle any motor vehicle upon any portion of a lot or parcel of land within any zone of the city on which the lawful primary use of the lot or parcel of land is other than automotive repair unless such vehicle is contained either:

1. Within an enclosed garage located on the lot or parcel of land on which the vehicle is located; or

2. On the rear one-third of the lot or parcel of land on which the vehicle is located; provided, that such vehicle is screened from public view by six-foot fencing approved by the city manager or his designee. Such vehicle shall not be stored within five feet of any adjoining property line.

11.04.010 Findings, purpose and intent.

A. The city council finds as follows:

1. There is a lack of adequate curbs, gutters, sidewalks and streets in various areas of the city, which is prejudicial and dangerous to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city;

2. The lack of improved sidewalks in the city in many instances forces pedestrians, including schoolchildren, to walk in the streets and to be subject to the hazards of vehicular traffic;

3. The lack of improved sidewalks during rainy weather has caused unhealthy conditions resulting from pedestrians walking through mud and water along streets or dirt shoulders;

4. Streets and highways of inadequate width and design hinder vehicular movements and may constitute a hazard to the safety and health of users;

5. The lack of curbs, storm drains and other street improvements results in poor drainage and a collection of filth and waste; and

6. The lack of improved streets impedes the operation of fire trucks, police cars and other emergency vehicles as well as the operation of street sweepers and refuse collection vehicles.

B. It is the purpose of the city council in adopting the provisions of this chapter to:

1. Impose reasonable requirements of dedication and improvements upon persons engaged in the development, construction, reconstruction or remodeling of buildings which tend to result in increased demands upon the existing public rights-of-way and streets and highways in the city, thereby increasing the danger to the public health, safety and welfare;

2. Extend the basic requirements of the Subdivision Map Act by establishing standards and requirements for dedication and improvements in connection with the development of land in which no subdivision is involved;

3. Alleviate the undesirable situation found to exist in subsection A by spreading the cost of public improvements upon abutting property in an equitable manner, and by causing the installation of those improvements required by the city to serve property about to be developed at the time of its development.

C. The city council intends to require, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the dedication of portions of the public rights-of-way, including streets, highways, alleys and storm drain facilities, and the construction of improvements contiguous to the property from the property line to the centerline of the public rights-of-way as necessitated by the nature and type of building or structure being constructed and the use to which the property is being put.

D. The provisions of this chapter are intended to be additional to any other requirement of law pertaining to the provision of public facilities and improvements, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to excuse compliance with any other requirement for the provision of public facilities or improvements. (Ord. 49 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 11.36.010)


11.04.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:

A. “Alley” means a public or private way permanently reserved as a secondary means of access to abutting property.

Rights-of-way shall also be provided for any improvements to existing facilities, including rights-of-way for storm drains or other required public facilities. All rights-of-way shall be accompanied by a title examination and be free of all liens and encumbrances.

B. The dedications required by subsection A of this section shall also apply to any person who alters, enlarges, expands or causes to be altered, enlarged or expanded any building in the city, if the cost of such work exceeds the sum of $100,000 as determined by building permit valuation.

C. The dedications required by this chapter shall be made prior to issuance of the building permit for the subject property.

D. Prior to the issuance of the building permit for the subject property, there shall be paid to the engineering department a fee in an amount established by city council resolution for processing the irrevocable offer of dedication. (Ord. 451 § 3, 2014; Ord. 49 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 11.36.030)

A. Any person who constructs, or causes to be constructed, any building in the city shall construct all necessary improvements in accordance with city specifications upon the property and along all street frontages adjoining the property upon which such building is constructed, unless adequate improvements already exist or as exempted by subsection B of this section. In each instance, the city manager, or the manager’s official designee, shall determine whether or not the necessary improvements exist and are adequate. Each building permit application shall be so endorsed at the time it is issued.

B. Curb, gutter or sidewalk improvements are not required for individual detached single-family homes in residential zones, except: (1) high residential (HR) zones; (2) commercial zones; (3) where the property adjoins a property with curb, gutter and/or sidewalk improvements; (4) where the city engineer determines drainage improvements are necessary. The city may require correction of existing street improvements such as damaged sidewalks.

C. The improvements required by subsection A of this section shall also apply to any person who alters, enlarges or expands, or causes to be altered, enlarged or expanded, any building in the city, if the cost of such work exceeds the sum of $100,000.

11.04.050 Public utility relocations.

In the event the city manager determines that the contemplated construction of improvements, as required by this chapter in individual cases, will necessitate the relocation or alteration of public utility facilities, including but not limited to gas, electricity, telephone and water, he may require the person requesting the building permit to produce satisfactory evidence that such person has made arrangements with such public utility company for the relocation or modification of such public utility facilities. (Ord. 49 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 11.36.050)


11.04.060 Construction of public improvements.

If the city manager determines that public improvements are required, these public improvements shall be designed to city standards, and their construction guaranteed by an improvement agreement secured by a bond or cash deposit, prior to issuance of a building permit for the subject property. If the building permit is not exercised, the improvement obligation shall terminate and the security shall be returned. The city manager is authorized to execute such agreements on behalf of the city. (Ord. 49 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 11.36.060)


11.04.070 Deferral of improvement requirements.

Upon written application, the city manager, by written order, may defer any of the improvements required by this chapter if he finds that the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city will not be endangered by the deferment of the construction of the improvements, and that any one of the following exists:




A. There is a lack of adequate data in regard to the grades, plans or surveys which complicates the construction of the improvements and indicates they should be deferred to a later time;

B. The construction of the improvements is included in an approved or pending assessment district or otherwise guaranteed as provided by city ordinance;

C. Construction of the improvements would be incompatible with the present state of the neighborhood’s development, or be impractical or premature because of the condition of the surrounding property; or

11.04.080 Appeal.

A. The granting or denial of a deferral of improvements pursuant to SBMC 11.04.070 by the city manager involving curbs, gutters, sidewalks or streets shall, unless appealed to the city council, become final within 10 calendar days after the filing of the manager’s written decision setting forth the findings in support thereof.

B. Any aggrieved person participating in the review and proceeding before the city manager may appeal such decision to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk stating the specific grounds of appeal, and paying a $25.00 fee to the clerk, within 10 calendar days of the manager’s written decision.

C. The city council shall set the matter for hearing within 30 days, and may approve, modify or disapprove the decision of the city manager. (Ord. 49 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 11.36.080)


11.04.090 Conditions of deferral.

Any deferral of improvements pursuant to SBMC 11.04.070 shall be conditioned on the filing with the city manager of a future improvement secured by one of the following:

A. A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized corporate sureties in a form approved by the city attorney;

B. A deposit, either with the city or with a responsible escrow agent or trust company selected by the city, of cash or negotiable instruments of the kind approved for securing deposits of public money;

D. A lien against the subject property, in a form satisfactory to the city attorney, which provides that the property owner will construct the improvements at such time as the city requires them to be constructed and gives the city a lien on the property to guarantee such construction. The city manager is authorized to execute such agreement on behalf of the city. Such agreement must be received and recorded prior to issuance of a building permit. If the building permit is not exercised, the city manager is authorized to execute a release of the security for the subject property. Prior to the recordation of a future improvement agreement, there shall be paid to the engineering department a fee in the amount established by city council resolution for processing of the agreement. (Ord. 49 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 11.36.090)


11.04.100 Waiver or modification of requirements.

Upon written application made before issuance of the building permit subject to the requirements of this chapter, accompanied by a fee in an amount established by city council resolution, the city council may, after a public hearing noticed in the same manner as is required for public hearings on application for variances from the requirements of the zoning ordinance, by resolution, waive or modify any of the requirements of this chapter if, based upon substantial evidence, it finds that the conditions of subsection A and B or of subsection C are met as follows:

A. The street fronting on the subject property has already been improved to the maximum feasible and desirable state, recognizing there are some such streets which may have less than standard improvements when necessary to preserve the character of the neighborhood, and to avoid unreasonable interference with existing conditions such as mature trees, walls, yards and open space; and

B. The granting of the waiver or modification will not perpetuate a hazardous or defective condition, be otherwise detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the city, or relieve a property owner of the obligations or requirements that have been imposed on other property or property owners on the same street; or

C. The requirement:

1. Is for a purpose not reasonably related to the use of the property, or

2. Deprives the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identified zoning classification, or

3. Imposes requirements that are not roughly proportional to requirements that have been imposed or could be imposed upon other property in the vicinity through land use regulation or any special assessment proceeding, or

4. Imposes a requirement that is not roughly proportional to the benefit to the property or to the burden resulting from use of the property. (Ord. 203 § 1, 1994; Ord. 49 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 11.36.100)


11.04.105 Criteria for determining whether a street or street segment has been improved to the maximum feasible and desirable state.

A. When considering an application for waiver or modification of requirements under SBMC 11.04.100, the city council may determine that a street or street segment has been improved to the maximum feasible and desirable state, despite the lack of curbs, gutters, sidewalks, width as specified in the general plan, or other features if the following criteria are met:

1. The street is designated as a local street by the general plan circulation element;

2. A petition requesting maintenance of the street or street segment without full improvements and consenting to the waiver or modification of the requirements for full improvements executed by the owners, as shown of the latest assessment roll, of not less than 75 percent of the parcels having frontage on, or taking access from, the street or street segment of which the request applies has been submitted to the city engineer;

3. The traffic safety commission has considered the petition and has determined that installation of curbs, gutters or sidewalks is not necessary to implement of “safe routes to schools” program.

B. The minimum street segment for which a petition may be submitted is the length between two cross-streets, or between a cross-street and a cul-de-sac or other terminus. (Ord. 217 § 1, 1996)


11.04.110 Duty to deny final building permit approval.

The building official shall deny final approval and acceptance of a building permit, and shall refuse to allow final public utility connections and occupancy in any building, structure or dwelling, unless the city manager determines that all required dedications have been made and that all necessary improvements exist, are constructed, or unless the city manager, pursuant to SBMC 11.04.070, has determined to defer the installation of such improvements, and the required future improvement agreement and a lien contract have been received and recorded, or unless the requirements of this chapter have been modified or waived pursuant to SBMC 11.04.100.

Article II. Public Nudity Prohibited


11.12.100 Purpose and intent.

A. The presence of persons who are nude and exposed to public view in or on public rights-of-way, public parks, public beaches or any other public land, or in or on any private property open to public view from any public right-of-way, public beach, public park, or any public land is offensive to members of the general public unwillingly exposed to such persons. The parks and beaches are owned by the city, are operated and maintained for the use, benefit, recreation and enjoyment of all citizens and residents of the city. It is in the public interest, and necessary to the public health, safety and welfare that the parks and beaches be utilized and enjoyed by as many persons as possible. The maximum utilization and enjoyment of the parks and beaches can only be obtained through the imposition of regulations regarding activities thereon. The appearance of some persons utilizing the parks and beaches without clothing, and with the private parts of their bodies exposed unreasonably interferes with the right of all persons to use and enjoy the parks and beaches by causing many persons to leave, and others not to come to the parks and beaches. Such conduct and behavior imposes an extraordinary and unusual burden on city employees charged with the maintenance of the parks and beaches and the preservation of the safety and well being thereof.

B. The provisions of this article are enacted for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, morals and general welfare of all persons in the city. (Ord. 29 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 8.04.010)

Whenever in this article the word “nude” is used, it means devoid of an opaque covering which covers the genitals, vulva, pubis, pubic symphysis, pubic hair, buttocks, natal cleft, perineum, anus, anal region, or pubic hair region of any person or any portion of the breast at or below the upper edge of the areola thereof of any female person. (Ord. 29 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 8.04.020)


11.12.120 Public place defined.

Whenever in this article the words “public place” are used, they mean any public beach, park, street or waters adjacent thereto, or any place open to the public or exposed to public view, including specifically a view from any private residence or any portion of the real property in the immediate vicinity of such private residence, whether such place is publicly or privately owned. (Ord. 29 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 8.04.030)


11.12.130 Public nudity prohibited.

It is a public nuisance and unlawful for any person to appear, sunbathe, bathe, walk, disrobe or otherwise be nude in any public place except in those portions of a comfort location expressly set aside for such purpose. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this article is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than six months, or by both fine and imprisonment. (Ord. 29 § 1, 1987; 1987 Code § 8.04.040)


11.12.140 Exceptions.

This article shall not apply to:

A. Persons under the age of 10 years;

B. Persons engaged in a live theatrical performance performed in a theater, concert hall or other similar establishment which is predominantly devoted to theatrical performances;

11.36.010 Findings and declarations.

The city finds that:

A. The uncontrolled placement of newsracks in public rights-of-way causes an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons using such rights-of-way, including pedestrians, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, and persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services.

B. The uncontrolled placement of newsracks detracts from the appearance of streets, sidewalks and adjacent businesses; inhibits safe entry and departure of vehicles; impairs the vision and distracts the attention of motorists and pedestrians, particularly small children and may cause injury to the person or property of such person.

C. Newsracks located so as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public rights-of-way, and unsightly newsracks located therein, constitute public nuisances.

D. The unregulated display of harmful matter (as defined by Section 313 of the California Penal Code) adversely affects the welfare of minors and others.

E. The intent of the city council of the city in adopting this chapter is to establish reasonable time, place and manner regulations of the use and placement of newsracks for the purpose of securing and promoting the public safety and general welfare of persons in the city in their use of public rights-of-way. It is the further intent of the city council to protect the general welfare by establishing reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the display of harmful matter in public places and places open to the public.

F. By adopting this chapter, the city council does not intend to authorize the placement of newsracks on property owned by the city, or public, except on public rights-of-way as defined herein. (Ord. 157 § 1, 1992)


11.36.020 Definitions of words and phases.

The following words and phrases when used in this chapter shall for the purpose of this chapter have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section:

A. “Newsrack” means any self-service or coin-operated box, container, storage unit or other dispenser installed, used or maintained for the display, sale or distribution of publications.

B. “Parkway” means the part of the public right-of-way between the sidewalk and curb of a roadway, the area between the edge of the traveled roadway and the edge of a public right-of-way when there is no sidewalk and any part of a roadway that is not open to vehicular travel.

C. “Public right-of-way” means any place owned and maintained by or dedicated to use of the public for the purpose of pedestrian or vehicular travel, including but not limited to a street, sidewalk, curb, gutter, parkway, highway, alley, mall or court. Public right-of-way does not include improved or unimproved pedestrian, equestrian or bicycle trails; pathways, walkways, driveways, or similar areas within parks or other city-owned property; or easements not previously used for the purpose of pedestrian or vehicular travel, and unless otherwise specifically permitted by the city council newsracks are prohibited in such areas.

D. “Publication” means any form of printed literature offered or available to the public including but not limited to hard and soft-covered books, magazines, print advertising and calendars.

E. “Roadway” means that part of a public right-of-way that is designed or used primarily for vehicular travel. (Ord. 157 § 1, 1992)


11.36.030 Newsrack permits.

A. Newsracks are prohibited on property owned by the city or by the public except that newsracks may be installed, placed and maintained on a public right-of-way subject to the issuance of a permit pursuant to this chapter. A newsrack permit issued in accordance with this chapter is required before the installation of, placement or maintenance of any newsrack which in whole or in part rests upon, in or over any public right-of-way.

B. Subject to the provisions of this section and SBMC 11.36.040, any person desiring to keep a newsrack placed, installed and maintained before July 15, 1993, shall apply for a permit therefor not later than November 1, 1993; provided, however, that any person that submitted an application under a previous version of this chapter shall not be required to resubmit an application. Newsracks for which a permit is not obtained shall be removed pursuant to the provisions of SBMC 11.36.070. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the city to issue a permit for a preexisting newsrack.

C. Newsrack permits shall be issued pursuant to the following requirements:

1. Application. A written application for a newsrack permit shall be filed with the city clerk, and shall contain the following information:

a. Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant and owner of the newsrack;

b. Name, address, and telephone number of a representative or other responsible person whom the city may notify or contact at any time concerning the applicant’s newsrack;

c. The number of newsracks covered by the permit along with a diagram of the location proposed for the installation of each newsrack covered by the permit showing dimensions and distances sufficient to allow a determination whether the proposed location of each newsrack complies with the provisions of this chapter;

d. The number of existing newsracks, if any, at the proposed location. The location of each existing newsrack shall be shown on the diagram required by paragraph (c);

e. Names of publications to be contained in each newsrack for which the applicant seeks a permit;

f. Type or brand of newsrack, including a description of each newsrack and mount.

2. Fee. Each application for initial issuance of a newsrack permit shall be accompanied by an application fee as established by resolution of the city council. In addition, if the permit is approved the applicant shall pay a fee for the annual permit sticker for each newsrack covered by the permit, which fee shall not exceed the actual cost of printing and providing the sticker.

3. Issuance and Denial. Upon receipt of a complete application and payment of the application fee, the city clerk shall refer the application to the city engineer and the code enforcement office for a report and recommendation. If the proposed installation as set forth in the application complies with the provisions of this chapter, the city clerk shall issue the newsrack permit. If a permit is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the specific reason for such denial and of the right to appeal the denial pursuant to SBMC 11.36.090. The city clerk shall endeavor to complete all processing and issue the permit within 30 days following acceptance of the application.

An application for a newsrack permit shall be approved for the newsrack or newsracks covered by the permit unless with respect to a newsrack it is determined that:

a. The proposed newsrack projects onto, into or over any part of the roadway, or which rests, wholly or in part, upon, along or over any portion of the roadway;

b. The proposed newsrack is to be installed in whole or in part, in or over any sidewalk or parkway; and:

i. The newsrack, at its proposed location, would endanger the safety of persons or property; or

ii. The proposed location is used for public utility purposes, public transportation purposes or other public use; or

iii. The newsrack, at its proposed location, would unreasonably interfere with or impede the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, the ingress into or egress from any residence, place of business, or any legally parked or stopped vehicle, or the use of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, or other objects present at or near said location; or

iv. The newsrack, at its proposed location, would violate federal, state or local standards relating to access for disabled persons; or

v. The newsrack does not meet the other requirements of this chapter.

A newsrack permit may be approved, conditionally approved or denied in whole or in part. If a newsrack permit is conditionally approved the conditions of approval shall be limited to the imposition of requirements that would assure installation of a newsrack in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Any conditions of approval shall be met before issuance of the annual sticker permit sticker for the conditionally approved newsrack or newsracks.

4. Term and Annual Permit Sticker. A newsrack permit shall be valid for the calendar year in which it was first issued and may be renewed from year to year by obtaining an annual permit sticker from the city clerk. Upon the initial issuance of a newsrack permit the city clerk shall give the applicant a permit sticker for each newsrack covered by the permit. The permittee shall place the permit sticker on the front cover of the newsrack in such a manner that it is permanently affixed to the newsrack. Any newsrack requiring a permit that does not have a permit sticker affixed to it shall be presumed to be located or installed in violation of this chapter.

The annual permit sticker shall be valid for the calendar year for which it is issued. Before January 31st of the year following the year for which the sticker is issued, the permittee shall obtain a new annual permit sticker for each permitted newsrack. The city clerk shall issue the renewed annual permit sticker upon verification by the permittee that the newsrack continues to be installed and located in compliance with the permit and payment of the annual permit sticker fee. The city clerk may adopt administrative procedures for determining the year for which a sticker is issued. (Ord. 180 § 1, 1993; Ord. 157 § 1, 1992)

Newsracks placed adjacent to the rear of the sidewalk shall be placed parallel to the wall and at least six inches from the wall. No newsrack shall be located directly in front of any display window of any commercial building abutting a sidewalk or parkway except near the curb without written permission of the owner of the business.

The number of newsracks permitted on any public right-of-way within a space of 200 feet in any direction within the same block may be increased to eight upon a determination of the city manager that the increase is necessary because of the high demand for publications at the specified location and that the additional racks will not interfere with the public use of the right-of-way for access purposes.

6. In determining which newsracks shall be permitted to be located in a particular place for which there are no existing newsracks or less than the permitted number of newsracks the city clerk shall give first priority to preexisting newsracks for which an application for a permit is submitted within the time period specified by this chapter or for which an application was previously submitted pursuant to any prior version of this chapter, and second priority to other newsracks based upon the date of submission of the application for a permit pursuant to this chapter. For the purposes of this subsection, a preexisting newsrack is one located, maintained and continuously used by the present applicant or publication on and after July 15, 1992.

7. In determining which newsracks shall be permitted to remain in a location where the number of preexisting newsracks exceeds the permitted number, the city clerk shall be guided by the following criteria:

b. Second priority shall be given to newsracks used for the sale or other distribution of publications which have been adjudicated to be newspapers of general circulation for San Diego County;

c. Third priority shall be given to newsracks used for the sale or other distribution of all other publications;

d. Each publication shall be permitted only one newsrack at the particular location;

e. Within each category established by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) priority shall be determined based upon the date of submission of the application for a newsrack permit pursuant to this chapter;

f. For the purposes of this subsection, a preexisting newsrack is one located, maintained and continuously used by the present applicant or publication on and after July 15, 1993.

i. An applicant demonstrates that there is insufficient room in one machine for the number of publications which are generally sold in one day at that location, or

ii. Where an applicant demonstrates that it publishes more than one edition of the publication for sale at the same time.

If more than one publication desires a permit for a particular location, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply without application of the exception;

B. Identification of Responsible Person. The name, address and telephone number of a responsible person who may be contacted at any time concerning the newsrack shall be displayed on the hood of a newsrack in such a manner as to be readily visible to and readable by a prospective customer.

C. Advertising Concerns. Newsracks shall carry no advertising except:

1. The name of the publication being dispensed in the same newsrack;

2. Advertising rack cards contained in card pans which are attached to and located on the front of the newsrack and do not exceed 15 inches in height and 22 inches in length. The rack cards shall be related to the display, sale, use or purchase of the newspaper or periodical being dispensed.

The coin-return mechanism shall be maintained in good working order at all times.

F. Hold Harmless Agreement. Each permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to a requirement that the permittee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city and its officers and employees from and against any claim, damage, or liability arising or resulting from the permit or from the placement or location of the newsrack. By acceptance of the permit the permittee shall agree: The city, its agents, officers and employees shall not be, nor be held liable for any claims, liabilities, penalties, fines or for any damage to any goods, properties or effects of any personal injuries to or death of any person, whether caused by or resulting from any acts or omission of owner or permittee, or his or her agents, employees or representatives, or for dangerous or defective conditions of the property of owner or permittee in any way caused by newsracks placed or maintained pursuant to the permit; owner or permittee further agrees to indemnify and save free and harmless and defend in any action, suit or proceeding the city, its agents, officers, and employees against any of the foregoing liabilities and any cost and expenses incurred by the city, its agents, officers or employees on account of any claims therefor.

G. Insurance Requirement.

11.36.070 Removal of newsracks.

A. Commencing December 2, 1993, any newsrack which has not obtained a permit pursuant to this chapter will be deemed nonconforming.

B. In the event that the city code enforcement officer determines that a newsrack does not comply with the provisions of this chapter or is nonconforming, he or she shall provide written notice of such determination to the permit applicant or owner. The notice shall specify the nature of the violation, the location of the newsrack which is in violation, the intent of the city code enforcement officer to remove the nonconforming newsrack in the event a hearing is not requested, and the right of the permittee to request a hearing, before the city code enforcement officer, within 15 days from the date of the notice. If the newsrack is one which ownership is not known, and is not apparent after inspection, a notice complying with this section shall be affixed to the newsrack.

C. In the event that a hearing is held pursuant to this section, the city code enforcement officer shall render a decision, in writing, within 10 days from the date of the hearing, and the decision shall advise the owner of his or her right to appeal to the city manager, pursuant to the provisions of SBMC 11.36.080.

“Impaired water body” means a water body that is listed by the RWQCB and SWRCB as impaired by a particular pollutant or pollutants, pursuant to Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. “303(d) listed water body” has the same meaning.

“Impervious surface area” means the ground area covered or sheltered by an impervious surface, measured in plain view (i.e., as if from directly above). For example, the “impervious surface area” for a pitched roof is equal to the ground area it shelters, rather than the surface area of the roof itself.

“Industrial activity” means the manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage at a commercial, industrial, or municipal facility. The term includes, but is not limited to, such manufacturing, processing, or storage in or upon industrial plant yards or immediate access roads used or traveled by carriers of raw materials; manufacture of products, waste material, or byproduct creation or storage; material handling; refuse storage or disposal; the application or disposal of processed wastewaters; storage and maintenance of material handling equipment; treatment, storage or disposal of residuals; outdoor shipping and receiving; activities in manufacturing buildings; storage of raw materials and intermediate and finished products; and the ownership, use or control of areas where significant industrial activity has taken place in the past and significant materials remain and are exposed to storm water. Material handling activities include the storage, loading and unloading, transportation, or conveyance of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, byproduct, or waste product.

“Industrial discharger” means a discharger who operates an industrial facility.

“Industrial facility” means any facility subject to the state industrial general storm water permit; any other facility primarily engaged in manufacturing, processing, storage or handling of raw materials, processed bulk materials, or refuse; and any other facility with a total outdoor uncovered area of more than two acres that is used for an industrial activity. Municipal facilities are not industrial facilities, unless they are subject to the state industrial general storm water permit.

“Infiltration” means the process of percolating storm water or non-storm water into the soil.

“Jurisdictional runoff management program” or “JRMP” means the city’s written description of the specific jurisdictional runoff management measures and programs that will be implemented to comply with Order No. R9-2013-0001 where the intent is to reduce storm water pollutant discharges in runoff to the MEP and not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards.

“Land development activity” means any activity or proposed activity that requires any of the permits or approvals listed in SBMC 13.10.040(F).

“Land disturbance activity” means any activity requiring a grading permit that moves soils or substantially alters the preexisting vegetated or man-made cover of any land. This includes, but is not limited to, grading, digging, cutting, scraping, stockpiling or excavating of soil; placement of fill materials; paving, pavement removal, exterior construction; substantial removal of vegetation where soils are disturbed including, but not limited to, removal by clearing or grubbing; or any activity which bares soil or rock or involves streambed alterations or the diversion or piping of any watercourse. “Land disturbance activity” does not include routine maintenance to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or the original purpose of the facility, nor does it include emergency construction activities (i.e., land disturbances) required to protect public health and safety.

“Land owner” means the holder of legal title to land, and other persons or entities who exercise control over a land development project pursuant to rights granted in a purchase agreement, joint venture agreement, development agreement or long-term lease.

“Maintenance of a BMP” means periodic action taken to maintain the as-designed performance of a BMP, and includes, but is not limited to, repairs to the BMP as necessary, and replacement of the BMP by an equally effective or more effective BMP at the end of its useful life.

“Maximum extent practicable” or “MEP” means the technology-based standard established by Congress in CWA Section 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) for storm water that operators of MS4s must meet. Technology-based standards establish the level of pollutant reductions that dischargers must achieve, typically by treatment or by a combination of source control and treatment control BMPs. MEP generally emphasizes pollution prevention and source control BMPs primarily (as the first line of defense) in combination with treatment methods serving as a backup (additional line of defense). MEP considers economics and is generally, but not necessarily, less stringent than BAT. A definition for MEP is not provided either in the statute or in the regulations. Instead the definition of MEP is dynamic and will be defined by the following process over time: municipalities propose their definition of MEP by way of their runoff management programs. Their total collective and individual activities conducted pursuant to the runoff management programs becomes their proposal for MEP as it applies both to their overall effort, as well as to specific activities (e.g., MEP for street sweeping, or MEP for MS4 maintenance). In the absence of a proposal acceptable to the San Diego Water Board, the San Diego Water Board defines MEP.

In a memo dated February 11, 1993, entitled “Definition of Maximum Extent Practicable,” Elizabeth Jennings, Senior Staff Counsel, SWRCB addressed the achievement of the MEP standard as follows:

To achieve the MEP standard, municipalities must employ whatever Best Management Practices (BMPs) are technically feasible (i.e., are likely to be effective) and are not cost prohibitive. The major emphasis is on technical feasibility. Reducing pollutants to the MEP means choosing effective BMPs, and rejecting applicable BMPs only where other effective BMPs will serve the same purpose, or the BMPs would not be technically feasible, or the cost would be prohibitive. In selecting BMPs to achieve the MEP standard, the following factors may be useful to consider:

a. Effectiveness: Will the BMPs address a pollutant (or pollutant source) of concern?

b. Regulatory Compliance: Is the BMP in compliance with storm water regulations as well as other environmental regulations?

c. Public Acceptance: Does the BMP have public support?

d. Cost: Will the cost of implementing the BMP have a reasonable relationship to the pollution control benefits to be achieved?

e. Technical Feasibility: Is the BMP technically feasible considering soils, geography, water resources, etc.?

The final determination regarding whether a municipality has reduced pollutants to the maximum extent practicable can only be made by the Regional or State Water Boards, and not by the municipal discharger. If a municipality reviews a lengthy menu of BMPs and chooses to select only a few of the least expensive, it is likely that MEP has not been met. On the other hand, if a municipal discharger employs all applicable BMPs except those where it can show that they are not technically feasible in the locality, or whose cost would exceed any benefit derived, it would have met the standard. Where a choice may be made between two BMPs that should provide generally comparable effectiveness, the discharger may choose the least expensive alternative and exclude the more expensive BMP. However, it would not be acceptable either to reject all BMPs that would address a pollutant source, or to pick a BMP based solely on cost, which would be clearly less effective. In selecting BMPs the municipality must make a serious attempt to comply and practical solutions may not be lightly rejected. In any case, the burden would be on the municipal discharger to show compliance with its permit. After selecting a menu of BMPs, it is the responsibility of the discharger to ensure that all BMPs are implemented.

“Motor vehicle” means any automobile, car, truck, bus, motor home or other self-propelled vehicle used or suited to use for on-road transportation; and any similar vehicle modified for off-road use.

“Municipal facility” means a facility owned or operated by the city of Solana Beach that is used for a governmental purpose. Facilities on municipally owned land that are leased or rented to others to generate municipal revenues are not municipal facilities. The commercial or industrial lessees of such facilities may, however, be subject to this chapter as commercial dischargers or industrial dischargers.

“Municipal separate storm sewer system” or “MS4” is a conveyance or system of conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains): (1) owned or operated by the city having jurisdiction over disposal of storm water; (2) designated or used for collecting or conveying storm water; (3) which is not a combined sewer; (4) which is not part of a publicly owned treatment works as defined at 40 CFR 122.26.

C. Construction and Application. Interpretation of this chapter shall assure consistency with the purpose and intent of this chapter and shall implement the requirements of NPDES Permit No. CAS0109266. This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other chapter, rule, or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other chapter, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards for human health or the environment shall take precedence. Storm water or non-storm water discharges regulated under a valid facility-specific NPDES permit or facility-specific RWQCB waste discharge requirements permit are not subject to this chapter, but shall instead be regulated exclusively by the RWQCB.

D. Recycled Water. This chapter is not intended to prohibit or prevent the use of recycled water, or the discharge of recycled water after use. This chapter is intended to require the use of BMPs for such uses and discharges as necessary to protect human health and the environment.

E. Severability and Validity. If any section of this chapter is declared invalid by a court of law, the remaining sections shall remain valid.

F. City Permits and Approvals.

1. An application for any of the following discretionary permits or approvals shall be accompanied by plans demonstrating a storm water management plan and incorporation of the Storm Water Standards Manual requirements into the design documents. Submitted materials shall demonstrate how the requirements of this chapter will be met, and the permit or approval shall not be approved unless the decision maker determines that the application complies with the requirements of this chapter:

a. Coastal development permit;

d. Excavation permit;

e. Sewer construction permit;

f. Underground tank permit;

g. Well permit;

h. Demolition permit.

G. City of Solana Beach Storm Water Standards Manual and Guidance Documents.

1. The city of Solana Beach Storm Water Standards Manual provides guidance, requirements and choices for compliance methods. Authorized enforcement officials may provide additional flexibility using the guidance documents authorized below.

2. Any authorized enforcement official under the supervision of the city engineer may prepare, disseminate and maintain guidance documents, addressing the use of pollution prevention practices and BMPs for specific activities or facilities, illegal connections, and illegal disposal.

These guidance documents may set out additional compliance alternatives that, in specified circumstances, can provide the same environmental protection that is afforded by the BMPs required by this chapter or specified in the city of Solana Beach Storm Water Standards Manual.

These guidance documents may also identify practices that have been determined by the authorized enforcement official to be additional BMPs that may be implemented for land disturbance activities and land development activities to prevent or control pollution to the maximum extent practicable (MEP). These additional BMPs shall become mandatory for affected dischargers only after being adopted into the city of Solana Beach JRMP, unless an order is issued pursuant to subsection H of this section.

Authorized enforcement officials may also take these guidance documents into account when determining whether any practices used by a discharger, or proposed in a grading plan, a SWPPP, an enforcement settlement offer, or any other submittal to the city, are BMPs that will prevent or control pollution to the MEP. These case-specific discretionary decisions may involve circumstances that were not anticipated when general guidance documents were prepared. Therefore, these guidance documents do not confer rights on dischargers in these circumstances and do not constrain the discretion of authorized enforcement officials. Where appropriate, and provided the same protection is provided to the environment, authorized enforcement officials may depart from these guidance documents when making case-specific decisions authorized by this chapter.

H. Significant Sources of Pollutants. Authorized enforcement officials shall identify discharges and categories of facilities and activities that are a significant source of contaminants to waters of the United States, despite compliance with this chapter. If any such contamination problem identified by the authorized enforcement official involves more than five identified sources having similar characteristics, the authorized enforcement official shall propose appropriate amendments to this chapter to better control contamination at issue. If the contamination problem identified by the authorized enforcement official is limited to fewer than five identified sources, the appropriate dischargers shall be ordered by the authorized enforcement official to install, implement and maintain additional BMPs to prevent or reduce contamination in storm water and non-storm water to the MEP. Any such order shall specify a reasonable date by which those BMPs must be put in place. A failure to install, implement, or maintain additional BMPs as required by any such order is a violation of this chapter.

I. Determining Whether a Discharge is Tributary to an Impaired Water Body. Areas within which facilities and sources will be presumed to be tributary to an impaired water body are as defined in SBMC 13.10.030 and as identified by the SWRCB and RWQCB’s most recent list of impaired water bodies. The presumption that a discharge is tributary to an impaired water body can be overcome for a particular discharge based on specific facts and analysis presented by a discharger. In making a site-specific determination as to whether a discharge is tributary to an impaired water body, consideration may be given: to the amount of water and pollutant discharged; to whether the pollutant is volatile or degradable; and to whether the pollutant is substantially removed during transport by any natural or manmade features (sinks, infiltration areas, ponds or impoundments, vegetated swales or wetlands, media filtration devices and similar features) located between the site and the impaired water body. Any such analysis must consider common mechanisms for pollutant mobilization, remobilization, and transport over time. Any such analysis and determination shall be disclosed for public review and comment to the extent required by CEQA or by city procedures for permit issuance.

J. Collection and Use of Storm Water. An authorized enforcement official may modify any requirement imposed by this chapter to allow the on-site collection and use of storm water, or the collection or storm water for delivery to and use at city-designated sites, provided the modified requirements are enforceable and provide equivalent environmental protection. (Ord. 472 § 1, 2017; Ord. 431 § 4, 2011; Ord. 379 § 1, 2008)

This category includes water line flushing and water main break discharges from water purveyors issued a water supply permit by the California Department of Public Health or federal military installations. Discharges from recycled or reclaimed water lines to the MS4 are allowed if the discharges have coverage under an NPDES permit, and the discharger is in compliance with the applicable NPDES permit and other applicable laws and regulations. Otherwise, discharges from water lines are illicit discharges.

D. Non-storm water discharges to the MS4 from the following categories are allowed, unless the enforcement official or the Regional Water Quality Control Board identifies the discharge as a source of pollutants to receiving waters, in which case the discharge is considered an illicit discharge:

1. Discharges from diverted stream flows;

2. Discharges from rising groundwater;

3. Discharges from uncontaminated groundwater infiltration to the MS4;

4. Discharges from springs;

E. Non-storm water discharges from the following categories are allowed if they are addressed with BMPs as described in SBMC 13.10.070. Otherwise, non-storm water discharges from the following categories are illicit discharges:

1. Air conditioning condensation;

2. Individual residential vehicle washing;

3. Flows from non-emergency fire fighting activities; and

4. Flows from emergency fire fighting activities.

F. Notwithstanding the categories of non-storm water discharges conditionally allowed by subsections A through F of this section, if the Regional Water Quality Control Board or the enforcement official determines that any of these categories of otherwise conditionally allowed non-storm water discharges are a source of pollutants to receiving waters, are a danger to public health or safety, or are causing a public nuisance, such discharges shall be prohibited from entering the MS4. (Ord. 472 § 1, 2017)


13.10.070 General BMP requirements.

A. Applicable Requirements. All dischargers in the city must comply with the generally applicable prohibitions and requirements in SBMC 13.10.040 through this section, and must also comply with any other parts of this chapter (including relevant parts of the city of Solana Beach JRMP) that are applicable to the type of facility or activity owned or operated by that discharger.

B. Minimum Best Management Practices for All Dischargers. All dischargers in the city must install, implement and maintain at least the following minimum BMPs:

1. Eroded Soils. Prior to the rainy season, dischargers must remove or secure any significant accumulations of eroded soils from slopes previously disturbed by clearing or grading, if those eroded soils could otherwise enter the storm water conveyance system or receiving waters during the rainy season.

2. Pollution Prevention. Dischargers shall implement those storm water pollution prevention practices that are generally recognized in that discharger’s industry or business as being effective and economically advantageous.

3. Prevention of Illegal Discharges. Illicit connections must be eliminated (even if the connection was established pursuant to a valid permit and was legal at the time it was constructed), and illegal discharge practices eliminated.

4. Slopes. Completed slopes that are more than five feet in height, more than 250 square feet in total area, and steeper than 3:1 (run-to-rise) that have been disturbed at any time by clearing, grading, or landscaping shall be protected from erosion prior to the first rainy season following completion of the slope, and continuously thereafter.

5. Storage of Materials and Wastes. All materials and wastes with the potential to pollute urban runoff shall be stored in a manner that either prevents contact with rainfall and storm water, or contains contaminated runoff for treatment and disposal.

6. Use of Materials. All materials with the potential to pollute urban runoff (including, but not limited to, cleaning and maintenance products used outdoors, fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, etc.) shall be used in accordance with label directions. No such product may be disposed of or rinsed into receiving waters or the storm water conveyance system.

C. Inspection, Maintenance, Repair and Upgrading of BMPs. BMPs at manned facilities must be inspected by the discharger before and following predicted rain events. BMPs at unmanned facilities must be inspected by the discharger at least once during the rainy season and at least once between each rainy season. These BMPs must be maintained so that they continue to function as designed. BMPs that fail must be repaired as soon as it is safe to do so. If the failure of a BMP indicates that the BMPs in use are inappropriate or inadequate to the circumstances, the BMPs must be modified or upgraded to prevent any further failure in the same or similar circumstances. 

D. Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. An authorized enforcement official may require a commercial, industrial or land disturbance activity discharger to prepare and submit a SWPPP for approval by that official if (1) the discharger does not come into compliance with this chapter after one or more warnings (or other enforcement action) that BMPs are inadequate or are not being adequately maintained; or (2) the facility or activity at issue is a significant source of contaminants to receiving waters despite compliance with this chapter. Any discharger required to submit and to obtain approval of a SWPPP shall install, implement, and maintain the BMPs specified in the approved SWPPP. 

The SWPPP shall identify the BMPs that will be used by the discharger to prevent or control pollution of storm water to the MEP. If the facility is an industrial facility, the SWPPP submitted to the city shall at a minimum meet the requirements of the state NPDES industrial general storm water permit. If the activity at issue is a construction or land disturbance activity, the SWPPP submitted to the city shall at a minimum meet the requirements of the state NPDES construction general storm water permit. If a facility required to submit a SWPPP to the city discharges non-storm water to groundwater, the facility shall obtain an RWQCB permit as required by the State Water Code, and shall describe the requirements of that permit in the SWPPP.

Whenever submission of a SWPPP is required pursuant to this chapter, an authorized enforcement official may take existing city BMPs into account when determining whether the practices proposed in the SWPPP are BMPs that will prevent or control pollution to the required level of MEP.

E. Notification of Spills, Releases and Illegal Discharges. Spills, releases, and illegal discharges of pollutants to receiving waters or to the storm water conveyance system shall be reported by the discharger as required by all applicable state and federal laws. In addition, any such spills, releases and illegal discharges with the potential to endanger health, safety or the environment shall be reported to the directors within 24 hours after discovery of the spill, release or discharge. If safe to do so, necessary actions shall be taken to contain and minimize the spill, release or illegal discharge. 

F. Sampling, Testing, Monitoring, and Reporting. Commercial, industrial or land disturbance activity dischargers shall perform the sampling, testing, monitoring, inspection and reporting required by this chapter. In addition, an authorized enforcement official may order a discharger to conduct sampling, testing, inspection or monitoring and to report the results to the city if (1) the authorized enforcement official determines that sampling, testing, inspection or monitoring is needed to determine whether BMPs are effectively preventing or reducing pollution in storm water to the MEP, or to determine whether the facility is a significant source of contaminants to receiving waters; or (2) the authorized enforcement official determines that sampling, testing, inspection or monitoring is needed to assess the impacts of an illegal discharge on health, safety or the environment; or (3) an illegal discharge has not been eliminated after written notice by an authorized enforcement official; or (4) repeated violations have been documented by written notices from authorized enforcement officials; or (5) the RWQCB requires the city to provide any information related to the discharger’s activities.

Sampling, testing, inspection and monitoring ordered pursuant to this subsection may include the following: 

1. Visual monitoring of dry weather flows, wet weather discharges, erosion, and/or BMPs;

2. Visual monitoring of premises for spills or discharges;

3. Visual observations for proper BMP implementation and warranted modifications to BMP implementation based on site-specific conditions;

4. Laboratory analyses of storm water or non-storm water discharges for pollutants;

5. Background or baseline monitoring or analysis; and 

6. Monitoring of receiving waters or sediments that may be affected by pollutant discharges by the discharger (or by a group of dischargers including the discharger).

The authorized enforcement official may direct the manner in which the results of required testing and monitoring are reported, and may determine when required sampling, testing or monitoring may be discontinued.

E. For properties that are already connected to the city’s sewerage system, the city engineer may require the installation of a backflow prevention device based on her or his professional opinion that there is a threat of potential harm due to the nature of the location of the property owner’s lateral connection and other related factors. The city engineer may allow the property owner a reasonable period of time to amortize the cost of the backflow prevention device or use other means to assist the property owner to comply with the protection device requirement. Failure of a property owner to install a necessary backflow prevention device shall allow the city engineer to halt service pursuant to SBMC 14.24.140. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)

Chapter 14.12 SEWER CONSTRUCTION REIMBURSEMENT CONNECTION FEE

Sections:

14.12.010    Purpose.

14.12.020    Procedure.

14.12.030    Term of agreement.

14.12.040    Reimbursement of costs by benefiting property owners connecting.


14.12.010 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to allow a reimbursement connection fee at the time of connection when the sewer service has been made available by a private developer prior to the time that the city would have been able to make the sewer service available. The purpose of the reimbursement connection fee is to reimburse the person privately constructing the sewer system which is dedicated to the public and offered to the city. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.12.020 Procedure.

A. The city and the developer may enter into a reimbursement agreement in which the developer agrees to dedicate the sewer main to the public and offer the main to the city.

B. Upon acceptance of the sewer main by the city in accordance with Section 4742.3 of the Health and Safety Code, the city may adopt a resolution imposing a reimbursement connection fee for connections to that sewer main. The reimbursement connection fee shall be determined by the city engineer and shall provide funds to reimburse the developer for costs of the main, which benefits other property owners that connect to the main. The reimbursement connection fee shall include a six percent per annum simple interest charge to partially compensate the developer for his financing costs. The developer shall not be reimbursed for his fair share of the project costs (that portion of the improvement costs that directly benefits his development). The city shall return the collected reimbursement connection fees to the developer, less administration fees and any other costs or fees, in accordance with the terms of the reimbursement agreement. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.12.030 Term of agreement.

The period over which special connection fees are collected shall be no longer than 10 or 20 years:

A. Projects with a total reimbursable cost not exceeding $250,000 shall have a 10-year reimbursement.

B. Projects with a total reimbursement of $250,000 or more and in which the city engineer estimates that less than two-thirds of the reimbursements can be collected in 10 years shall have a 20-year reimbursement period. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.12.040 Reimbursement of costs by benefiting property owners connecting.

When a sewer main extension has been installed and a reimbursement agreement amount has been approved by the city council, any benefiting property owner, prior to connection to the sewer system, who has not either himself or through his predecessor in interest contributed toward the cost of such installation, shall pay to the city, in addition to any sewer connection fees required by this code or any other ordinance of the city, the reimbursement connection fee for such sewer main extension, at the rate provided for by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)

14.16.140    Sewer lateral cleanout covers required.

14.16.150    Pipe installation – Trenching, bedding, backfilling, paving and compaction.


14.16.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to specify some of the city’s requirements relating to sewer construction. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.020 Sewer utility holes must be accessible by city maintenance vehicles.

The developer shall be required to grade an access road to maintain any public sewers con-structed within easements and may be required to dedicate additional access easements to maintain the public sewers. All of the sewer utility holes must be accessible by vehicle. In order to be accepted into the city’s publicly maintained sewer system, all new sewer mains shall be constructed only within maintained roadways that have all-weather surfacing. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.030 Installation of sewer lateral connections from main to the property lines are required for unconnected properties when a sewer main is constructed.

When a sewer main is constructed as part of a public right-of-way improvement plan, the developer is required to install sewer lateral connections to the property line for each developed, unconnected lot that could be served by that sewer main. This is to limit the construction on newly improved public roadways. In addition, the developer is required to show all lateral locations on the improvement plan installed by the developer. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.040 Cost of sewer lateral connection.

The expense of construction, installation, replacement, and maintenance of the sewer laterals are solely the responsibility of the applicant. Sewer lateral work in the public right-of-way requires a city permit. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.050 Separate sewer laterals.

Separate sewer laterals are required for each single-family dwelling and condominium. However, a separate sewer lateral is not required for an approved accessory unit to a single-family dwelling on the same lot. Every separate residential building or other building on one lot connected to the sewer main shall be separately and independently connected with the city sewer system. The exception to this rule is the situation where there is a building in the rear of a lot without access to any other available sewer main. In this case, it may be connected with the sewer of the building in the front of the same lot. All condominiums shall have separate connections, unless a homeowner’s association is formed to manage and maintain the private sewer lateral. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.060 Privately owned sewer pumps.

Private sewage discharge pumps may be permitted only if it can be determined that no other alternatives exist or that an unnecessary hardship is thereby created. Sewer pump proposals will require the applicants to have a civil engineer review the alternatives and submit their findings to the city engineer for review. If the sewer pump is permitted, the property owner will assume all liability and responsibility associated with the maintenance and operation of the sewage pump. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.070 No surface water connection allowed to the sewer system.

No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sewer. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.080 Excavations to be properly barricaded and noticed.

All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades, lights, and signage so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, sewer easements and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a timely manner, to the satisfaction of the city. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.090 Sewer utility easements.

Sewer utility easements shall be obtained for all sewer main extensions, except for sewer mains to be located within a public street. Under no circumstances shall any structure be placed over or around any sewer main or extension, or within a city utility easement, unless an encroachment permit has been granted by the city engineer. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.100 Inspection.

Inspection of all sewer connections shall be made by personnel of the city or its authorized representative as deemed necessary by the city engineer. Sewer construction shall include, but not be limited to, sewers, pump stations, treatment plants, pretreatment facilities, food establishment facilities, or other facilities which discharge grease and oils that may cause blockages. Inspections may be made to determine that such facilities are being adequately maintained and operated and meet the provisions of this code. Sewer facilities under construction shall be inspected periodically or as deemed necessary by the city engineer to assure that construction conforms to the intent of the approved plans and specifications, city design standards and other applicable codes. No person shall bury or backfill new sewers or laterals until inspected by personnel of the city or its authorized representative. No person shall interfere with or delay entrance by an authorized city inspector attempting to inspect any sewer construction. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.110 Responsibility for damages to sewers or streets by person doing work.

Any person who shall do or cause to be done work provided for in this chapter shall be liable for any damage to any sewer or to any public street or to any other public property. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.16.120 Sewer construction permits.

A sewer construction permit must be issued before the material sewer connection can be made to the public sewer system. Prior to a sewer connection permit being issued, the property must be within the jurisdiction of the city’s sewer system, and the wastewater discharge permit fees paid, as well as all other required sewer fees. In cases of sewer lateral installation in a new subdivision or on a public sewer main extension under construction, the issuance of wastewater discharge permits may be deferred until prior to issuance of any building permits. Right-of-way construction permits are required when sewer construction permits are issued for work in the public right-of-way. The cost of all soils and material testing, as well as the cost of any necessary special inspection, shall be directly borne by the applicant/developer.

This chapter shall be known as the “city of Solana Beach industrial wastewater pretreatment ordinance.” (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the maximum beneficial public use of the city’s wastewater system through adequate regulation of sewer construction, sewer use, and industrial wastewater discharge, to provide for equitable distribution of the city’s costs, and to provide procedures for complying with wastewater discharge requirements placed upon the city by San Elijo Joint Powers Authority and other regulatory bodies. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.030 Scope.

This chapter shall be interpreted in accordance with the definitions set forth herein and the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the direct or indirect discharge of all waste into the city’s sewer system. This chapter provides for the regulation of sewer construction in areas within the former Solana Beach Sanitary District boundaries and the city limits of the city of Solana Beach. This chapter also provides for the regulation of the quantity and quality of discharged wastes, the degree of wastewater pretreatment required, provision for fees and charges, the issuance of permits for industrial wastewater discharge, and the establishment of penalties for violation of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.040 Adherence to pretreatment ordinance of San Elijo Joint Powers Authority.

The city of Solana Beach is a member of the San Elijo Joint Powers Authority and therefore has adopted the San Elijo Joint Powers Authority’s pretreatment ordinance. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any such influent that is inconsistent with the San Elijo Joint Powers Authority’s pretreatment ordinance, on file in the office of the city clerk of the city of Solana Beach, and any amendments thereto. In the event of any inconsistencies between regulations approved by San Elijo Joint Powers Authority, the city council and other regulations adopted by the city, the more restrictive regulations shall apply. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.050 Industrial wastewater discharge permit required.

No person shall connect to or otherwise discharge, or cause to be discharged into the sewer system of the city, any industrial waste unless the city engineer determines that such discharge meets the industrial waste discharge standards established by the rules or regulations adopted as herein provided, in which case no industrial waste permit shall be required. If the discharge does not meet the industrial waste discharge standards established by this title, then an industrial waste discharge permit is required. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.060 Issuance of industrial wastewater discharge permit.

Industrial wastewater permits shall be co-issued by the city and the San Elijo Joint Powers Authority according to this code and San Elijo Joint Powers Authority regulations. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to sewerage facilities without first obtaining a permit for industrial wastewater discharge. The permit for industrial wastewater discharge may require pretreatment of industrial waste before discharge, restriction of peak flow discharges, prohibition of discharge of certain waste components, restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, payment of additional charges to defray increased costs created by the waste discharge, and such other conditions as may be required to effectuate the purpose of this chapter.

No permit shall be issued to any person to discharge industrial waste into the sewer system of the city if such discharge will be a hazard or danger to the health or safety of any person or to the property of any person or if such discharge will result in a danger to the capacity, construction, use or proper performance or utilization of the sewer system or be otherwise detrimental or injurious to such systems or either of them, and unless the applicant has complied with all state, federal, and local laws and with all the provisions of this code and with all applicable rules and regulations adopted as provided for in this title. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.070 Fees for industrial wastewater discharge permits.

Fees may be charged by the city for industrial wastewater discharge permits, for both the issuance of original permits and renewals. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.080 Pretreatment plans required.

In the event the city engineer determines that pretreatment is required to make the waste acceptable, the applicant shall be so notified and shall submit suitable engineering plans and specifications showing in detail the proposed pretreatment facilities and pretreatment operational procedures which shall be included within and become a part of the original application. A permit shall not be issued until such plans, specifications and operational procedures have been reviewed and approved by the city engineer. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.090 Access for monitoring.

When required by the city engineer, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastewater shall install monitoring and recording equipment, and a suitable control access hole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such access hole shall be readily accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans by the city engineer. The access hole shall be installed and maintained by the owner at the owner’s expense. If no special access hole is available, the sampling location shall be determined by the city engineer – which may be the nearest downstream utility hole from the point at which the building sewer is connected. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.100 Self-monitoring and reporting.

All industrial users shall be subject to self-monitoring and reporting requirements. The requirements for each applicable user shall be determined by the city engineer and included in the user’s discharge permit. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.110 Public access to information.

Information and data provided by an industrial user identifying the nature and frequency of a discharge shall be available to the public without restriction. Any information or data which is submitted or which may be furnished by a user in connection with required periodic reports shall also be available to the public unless the user or other interested person specifically identifies and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the disclosure of such information or a particular part thereof to the general public would divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.120 Revisions to permits.

The city engineer shall be empowered to revise discharge permit requirements to comply with evolving federal, state, and local laws. Permit revisions or modifications shall not be inconsistent with applicable federal pretreatment standards. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.130 Permit expiration, transference, revocation or suspension.

Any permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be valid for a specified period and is not transferable unless such permit is revoked or suspended as provided in this title and in the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.140 Violation – Disconnection of facilities – Reconnection charge.

The city engineer may revoke or suspend the permit issued to any person in the event of a violation by the permittee of any provision of any applicable state, federal or local laws or this chapter or of any of the rules and regulations adopted in the manner provided for herein. The city engineer, in accordance with the law, may disconnect from the public sewer any connection to a sewer, main line sewer, or other facility which is constructed, connected or used without a permit, or constructed, connected or used contrary to any of the provisions of any applicable federal, state, or local law or this chapter or the rules and regulations adopted as provided for in this chapter. When a premises has been disconnected, it shall not be reconnected until the violation for which it was disconnected has ceased or been remedied and a reasonable charge for such disconnection and reconnection, as established by the city engineer, has been paid. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.150 Notice of intention to disconnect premises.

The city engineer shall give not less than five days’ notice of intention to disconnect the premises or to suspend or revoke a permit, stating the reasons therefor, and may grant a reasonable time for elimination of the violation; provided, however, that if the city engineer determines that the danger is imminent and such action is necessary for the immediate protection of the health, safety or welfare of the persons or property or for the protection of the sewer system, any premises may be disconnected and service terminated concurrently with the giving of such notice. Notice shall be given to the occupant of the premises, if any, and to the record owner of the property as shown upon the last equalized assessment roll of the county of San Diego by United States mail, registered or certified, return receipt requested, or by posting such notice on the premises. (Ord. 338 § 1, 2005)


14.24.160 Enforcement.

The city engineer is charged with the duty of enforcing the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations adopted as provided in this chapter. The city engineer and the city/San Elijo Joint Powers Authority’s duly authorized agents and employees are authorized and shall be permitted to enter upon all properties at all reasonable times and during operating hours of businesses for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing, or other reasons to assure the enforcement and proper application of all the provisions, rules and regulations as provided in this chapter.

15.08.010 Adoption of the California Building Code, Part 2, Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.

A. There is adopted and incorporated by reference herein as the city building code for the purpose of prescribing regulations in the city of Solana Beach for the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, repair, moving, removal, conversion, demolition, occupancy, equipment, use, height, area, and maintenance of buildings and structures, the 2016 California Building Code, Part 2, Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, a portion of the 2016 California Building Standards Code, as defined in the California State Health and Safety Code, Section 18901 et seq., including those appendix chapters not shown as deleted by this chapter. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter all erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, repair, moving, removal, conversion, demolition, occupancy, equipment, use, height, area and maintenance of buildings and structures within the city of Solana Beach shall be in conformance with the 2016 California Building Code which is based on the International Building Code, 2015 Edition, and the adopted appendix chapters, published by the California Building Standards Commission.

B. Findings. The city of Solana Beach has many large brush-covered hillsides. The city is subject to frequent Santa Ana conditions consisting of dry gusting winds, which create extreme fire dangers. The city council specifically finds that these geographic and topographic conditions necessitate greater fire protection than that provided by the State Building Code. Therefore, this chapter alters the 2016 California Building Code to require more fire retardant roof coverings.

C. Deletions, revisions and additions to the 2016 California Building Code shall be as follows: (Ord. 471 § 2(B), 2016)


15.08.020 Section 105.1.3 added.

Upon written request of permittee, or the owner where the permittee is not the owner, the building official with the written consent of the City Manager, may one-time extend the time periods established by this paragraph for a maximum cumulative time of six months if both of the following are met: (i) the permittee is not in violation of the permit or any of the uniform construction codes adopted by the city; and(ii) the permittee has diligently done work under the permit, but for a good cause shown the work has not been able to be completed within the specified time. The City Manager shall provide a copy of this section to any permittee seeking a first time extension request and shall advise the permittee of the regulations relating to second request for time extensions.

3. The provisions of this subparagraph 3 shall apply to permits issued for all construction where work pursuant to the permit is undertaken to cure or abate a notice of violation of any city ordinance or state statute, including but not limited to violations resulting from construction commenced without the prior issuance of a permit. All such work shall be completed not less than nine months after the issuance of the permit or within such shorter period of time as may be established by order of an officer or employee authorized to enforce the provisions of this code, or the city attorney, as a consequence of code enforcement activity. Extensions of time may be granted by the city council.

4. In addition to the other penalties, a violation by a permittee of the provisions of this subsection (f) shall be grounds for revocation of the permit.

5. In order to recommence work on a project for which the permit has been revoked under the provisions of this subsection (f), the permittee shall submit a new permit application accompanied by new full plan review fees and complete plans and specifications for review by all applicable agencies and/or City departments. Before a new permit can be issued, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. Failure to remove the partially completed work shall cause the work to be considered a dangerous building or structure and the City may proceed with abatement of the work as a public nuisance.

A. Hazards. The city engineer shall not issue a grading permit in any case where he finds that the work as proposed by the applicant is likely to adversely affect the stability of adjoining property or result in the deposition of debris on any public way or interfere with any existing drainage course or be in an area determined to be subject to geological hazard. If it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the hazard can be essentially eliminated by the construction of retaining structures, buttress fills, drainage devices, or by other means, the city engineer may issue the permit with the condition that such work be performed.

B. Land Use. The city engineer shall not issue a grading permit for work on a site unless the proposed uses shown on the grading plan for the site will comply with all provisions of the zoning ordinances.

C. Environmental Constraints. No grading permit shall be issued for grading of natural slopes with an inclination of 25 percent or more, or for wetlands or coastal or inland bluffs, unless the city council has found that such grading is necessary to permit a reasonable economic use of the property. Any application for grading on slopes with an inclination of 25 percent or more shall contain information showing:

1. The need for the grading in order to permit a reasonable economic use of the property;

2. That the grading is the minimum necessary to permit a reasonable economic use of the property; and

3. That the proposed grading will be accomplished without substantial harm to the environment. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.090)


15.40.110 Bond required.

A. There is imposed upon each grading permit the following objectives:

1. To comply with the provisions of this code or other applicable laws and ordinances;

2. To comply with all terms and conditions of the permit for excavation or fill to the satisfaction of the city engineer;

3. To complete all of the work contemplated under the permit within the time limit specified in the permit or complete the work to a safe condition satisfactory to the city engineer. The city engineer may, for sufficient cause, extend the time specified in the permit, but no such extension shall release the surety upon the bond.

These obligations shall be secured as provided in this section.

B. A permit shall not be issued unless the permittee shall first post with the city engineer a bond, in a form prescribed by the city attorney, executed by the owner and a corporate surety authorized to do business in the state as a surety in an amount sufficient to cover the protective devices and any corrective work necessary to remove and eliminate engineering and geological hazards. In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may provide a deposit either with the city or a responsible escrow agent or trust company selected by the city of cash or negotiable bonds of the kind approved for securing deposits of its public moneys; or an irrevocable letter of credit, in a form approved by the city attorney, from one or more responsible financial institutions regulated by federal or state government and pledging that the funds are available and guaranteed for payment on demand by the city. The city engineer may reduce the amount of the bond to the extent that he determines that the hazard or danger created by the work does not justify the full amount. No bond shall be required when the city engineer determines the proposed grading will not adversely affect the subject property or adjacent property or existing or proposed structures thereon, and will not create, cause, or precipitate a geological, flood, drainage, erosion, siltation, or other adverse environmental impact if, for any reason, the proposed project or grading is not completed. On development where progressive individual grading projects or several concurrent projects are being constructed by one owner, a continuing bond or single letter of credit may be provided which will cover all such projects; the amount thereof shall be determined by the city engineer.

C. Each bond, escrow or letter of credit shall be valid upon the date of filing and shall remain valid until the work has been completed to the satisfaction of the city engineer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Upon satisfactory completion of the work and compliance of all the terms and conditions of the grading permit, the city engineer may release the grading security and notify the surety or financial institution of such release.

D. Whenever the city engineer finds or determines that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement of a condition of a permit issued hereunder, written notice thereof shall be given to the principal and to the surety on the bond. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof and the period of time deemed by the city engineer to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the surety shall, within the time specified, cause or require the work to be performed and completed. When the grading permit obligations are secured by an escrow deposit or letter of credit, notice to the financial institution or escrow agent shall be given in the manner provided in this section for giving of notice to the surety.

E. A substitute bond or letter of credit may be filed in place of any above-mentioned bond or letter of credit, and the city engineer may accept the same if it is suitable to ensure completion of the work remaining to be performed and in proper form and substance, and the bond or letter of credit for which it is substituted may be exonerated if the city engineer finds that the conditions of such bond or letter of credit for which a substitute has been filed have been satisfied and that no default exists as to the performance upon which the bond or letter of credit is conditioned.

F. The city engineer may require that up to 10 percent of any bond be submitted in the form of a cash deposit. The cash deposit may be utilized by the city to ensure that adequate safeguards for the prevention of erosion and sedimentation are in place when needed. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.100)


15.40.120 Regulation of excavation. 

A. Cuts shall not be steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical unless the owner furnishes a soils engineering or an engineering geology report, or both, stating that the site has been investigated and giving an opinion that a cut at a steeper slope will be stable and not create a hazard to public or private property. The city engineer may require the excavation to be made with a cut face flatter in slope than two horizontal to one vertical, if he finds it necessary for stability and safety.

B. Cut slopes more than 40 feet in height shall have drainage terraces provided at vertical intervals not exceeding 25 feet. Such terraces shall not be less than eight feet in width (total horizontal distance) except that when the total slope height exceeds 100 feet, one terrace near midheight shall be not less than 20 feet in width (total horizontal distance). The design and construction of drainage terraces shall conform to the requirements of SBMC 15.40.150. 

C. Minimize area cleared for excavation and grading to only the portion of site that is necessary for construction. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 278 § 1, 2002; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.110)


15.40.130 Regulation of fills.

A. Compaction. All fills shall be compacted throughout their full extent to a minimum of 90 percent of the maximum density as determined by ASTM Soil Compaction Test D1557-70. Field density shall be determined by a method acceptable to the city engineer.

1. Compaction may be less than 90 percent of maximum density, as determined by the above test, within six inches of the slope surface when such surface material is placed and compacted by a method acceptable to the city engineer.

2. Fills not intended to support structures need not be compacted to these standards if the city engineer determines that such compaction is unnecessary as a safety measure. In making this determination, the city engineer may require that an investigation be made by a soils engineer to establish the characteristics of the susceptibility of the soil to erosion or slippage.

3. Slope surfaces may be prepared for planting by scarifying, by the addition of top soil, or by other methods; provided, such slopes when so prepared otherwise comply with the requirements of this section.

B. Preparation of Ground. The existing ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill or other incompetent material. No compacted fill shall be placed unless the underlying soil or bedrock has been investigated by the soils engineer or geologist and found to be capable of safely supporting the additional weight. Where the slope of the existing ground surface is five horizontal to one vertical or steeper, the fill shall be supported on level benches cut into competent material. Except where recommended by the soils engineer or geologist as not being necessary, subdrains shall be provided under all fills placed in natural drainage courses and in other locations where seepage is evident. Such subdrainage systems shall be of a material and design approved by the soils engineer and acceptable to the city engineer. The location of the subdrains shall be recorded in plan and elevation by the soils engineer and shown on all as-built plans.

C. Fill Slope. The steepness of fill slopes shall be determined by a soils engineer who shall submit soil test data and engineering calculations to substantiate to the satisfaction of the city engineer the stability of the fill slope surface under conditions of saturation. In the absence of such determination, no fill slope shall exceed a steepness of two horizontal to one vertical.

D. Fill Material. No organic or other reducible material shall be incorporated in fills. Except as recommended by the soils engineer and approved by the city engineer, no rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than 12 inches shall be buried or placed in compacted fills.

E. Drainage Terraces Required. Fill slopes more than 30 feet in height shall have drainage terraces provided at vertical intervals not exceeding 25 feet. Such terraces shall be not less than eight feet in width (measured horizontally from the outside edge) except that where the total slope height exceeds 100 feet, one terrace near midheight shall be not less than 20 feet in width (measured horizontally from the outside edge). The design and construction of drainage terraces shall conform to the requirements of SBMC 15.40.150.

F. Slopes to Receive Fill. Where fill is to be placed above the top of an existing or proposed cut or natural slope steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, the toe of the fill shall be set back from the top edge of the slope a minimum distance as may be specifically recommended by a soils engineer or engineering geologist and approved by the city engineer. Fills shall not toe out on slopes steeper than two horizontal to one vertical.

G. Inspection and Testing. The soils engineer shall provide sufficient inspection during fill placement and compaction operations to determine that such work is being performed in accordance with conditions of plan approval and requirements of this code. Continuous inspection shall be provided by the soils engineer or his responsible representative for all fills that will exceed a vertical height or depth of 30 feet or result in a slope surface steeper than two horizontal to one vertical. Tests to determine density of the compacted fill soils shall be made on the basis of not less than one test for each two-foot vertical lift of the fill, but not less than one test for each 1,000 cubic yards of material placed. In addition, density tests at a point approximately one foot below the fill slope surface shall be made on the basis of not less than one test for each 10-foot vertical of slope height. All such density tests shall be reasonably uniformly distributed within the fill or fill slope surface. Results of such testing and location of tests shall be presented in the soils engineer’s report. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.120)


15.40.140 Slope location and setbacks.

A. Cut and fill slopes shall be set back from site boundaries and buildings shall be set back from cut or fill slopes in accordance with the following figure and as hereinafter provided. Setback dimensions identified as “a” and “c” in the following figure shall be horizontal distances measured perpendicular to the site boundary. Setbacks “b,” “d,” and “e” shall be horizontal distances measured perpendicular to the indicated contour of the slope face.

B. The setback and other restrictions imposed by this section may be increased where unusual soil or geologic conditions make such increase necessary for safety or stability or may be modified upon investigation and recommendation by a soils engineer or geologist where such modification will provide equivalent safety, stability and protection, and the city engineer so finds.

C. Where a fill slope is to be placed near the site boundary and the adjacent off-site property is developed, special precautions shall be incorporated in the work as the city engineer deems necessary to protect the adjoining property from damage as a result of such grading. These precautions may include, but are not limited to:

1. Additional setbacks;

2. Provision for retaining or slough walls;

3. Mechanical or chemical treatment of the fill slope surface to minimize erosion;

4. Provisions for the control of surface waters. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.130)


15.40.150 Drainage requirements.

A. General. The drainage structures and devices required by this code shall be designed in accordance with recognized principles of hydraulics.

B. Disposal. All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain, or natural watercourse approved by the city engineer as a safe place to deposit such waters. If the drainage device discharges onto natural ground, rip-rap or a similar energy dissipator may be required.

C. Site Drainage. Graded building sites (building pads) shall have a minimum slope of one percent towards a public street or drainage structure approved to receive storm waters. A lesser slope may be approved by the city engineer for sites graded in relatively flat terrain, or where special drainage provisions are made, when he finds such modification will not result in unfavorable drainage conditions. All building sites on property containing or located immediately adjacent to a coastal or inland bluff shall be graded to drain away from the bluff.

D. Drainage Terraces. Drainage terraces shall have a longitudinal grade of not less than two percent nor more than 12 percent and a minimum depth of one foot at the flow line. There shall be no reduction in grade along the direction of flow unless the velocity of flow is such that slope debris will remain in suspension on the reduced grade. Such terraces shall be paved with concrete not less than three inches thick reinforced with six-inch by six-inch/No. 10 by No. 10 welded wire fabric or equivalent reinforcing; granite ditches are not satisfactory to comply with this requirement. Drainage terraces exceeding eight feet in width need only be so paved for a width of eight feet; provided, such pavement provides a paved channel at least one foot in depth. Downdrains or drainage outlets shall be provided at approximately 300-foot intervals along the drainage terrace or at equivalent locations. Downdrains and drainage outlets shall be of approved materials and of adequate capacity to convey the intercepted waters to the point of disposal.

E. Overflow Protection. Berms, swales or other devices shall be provided at the top of cut or fill slopes to prevent surface waters from overflowing onto and damaging the face of the slope. Special drainage provisions shall be made where a building or structure exists within five feet of the top of the slope. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.140)


15.40.160 Planting of slopes.

A. Planting. The surface of all cut slopes more than five feet in height and fill slopes more than three feet in height shall be protected against damage by erosion by planting with drought-resistant groundcover plants. Slopes exceeding 15 feet in vertical height shall also be planted with drought-resistant shrubs, spaced at not to exceed 10 feet on centers, or a combination of shrubs and trees at equivalent spacings, in addition to the drought-resistant groundcover plants. The plants selected and planting methods used shall be suitable for the soil and climatic conditions of the site. Plant material shall be selected which will produce a permanent planting coverage effectively controlling erosion. Consideration shall be given to deep-rooted plant material needing limited watering; to low maintenance during the lifetime of the project; to high root-to-shoot ratio (weight aboveground parts versus root system); wind susceptibility and fire retardant characteristics. Planting need not be provided for cut slopes rocky in character and not subject to damage by erosion and any slopes protected against erosion damage by other methods when such methods have been specifically recommended by a soils engineer, engineering geologist, or equivalent authority and found to offer erosion protection equal to that provided by the planting specified in this section.

B. Irrigation. Slopes required to be planted by subsection A of this section shall be provided with an approved system of irrigation designed to cover all portions of the slope and plans therefor shall be submitted and approved prior to installation. A functional test of the system may be required. For slopes less than 20 feet in vertical height, hose bibs to permit hand watering will be acceptable if such hose bibs are installed at conveniently accessible locations where a hose no longer than 50 feet is necessary for irrigation. The requirements for permanent irrigation systems may be modified upon specific recommendation of a landscape architect or equivalent authority that, because of the type of plants selected, the planting methods used and the soil and climatic conditions of the site, irrigation will not be necessary for the maintenance of the slope planting.

C. Release of Bond. The planting and irrigation systems required by this section shall be installed as soon as practical after rough grading. Prior to approval of grading and release of the grading bond, the planting shall be well established and growing on the slopes. 

Temporary vegetation cover or other erosion control methods may be required prior to establishment of permanent vegetation cover. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 278 § 1, 2002; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.150)


15.40.170 Storm damage precautions – Generally.

A. No grading permit shall be issued for work to be commenced between November 11th of any year and April 11th of the following year, unless the plans for such work include details of protective measures including desilting basins or other temporary drainage or control measures or both as may be necessary to protect adjoining public and private property from damage by erosion, flooding, or the deposition of mud or debris which may originate from the site or result from such grading operations.

B. If grading is begun prior to November 11th, all protective measures shall be installed prior to November 11th. If grading is begun on or after November 11th, all protective measures shall be installed before grading is begun. All protective measures shall be maintained in good working order until April 11th of the succeeding year, where grading is done between November 11th and December 31st, or until April 11th of the same year where grading is done between January 1st and April 11th, unless their removal at an earlier date is approved by the city engineer. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.160)


15.40.180 Storm damage precautions – Incomplete work.

A. Where a grading permit is issued and the work is commenced after April 11th and before October 1st of any year and the plans for such work do not include details of the protective measures described in SBMC 15.40.170, and it appears that the grading and installation of the permanent drainage devices as authorized by the permit will not be completed prior to November 1st, then on or before October 1st the owner of the site on which the grading is being performed shall file or cause to be filed with the city engineer revised plans which include the details of the protective measures described in, and in all other respects follow the provisions of, SBMC 15.40.170.

B. The revised plans required by this section shall be accompanied by a plan checking fee specified in SBMC 15.40.070(F), based on an assumed volume of material equal to five percent of the volume shown on the original permit. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.170)


15.40.190 Storm damage precautions – Effect of noncompliance.

Should the owner fail to submit the plans or fail to provide the protective measures required by SBMC 15.40.150 and 15.40.160 by the dates specified therein, it shall be deemed that a default has occurred under the conditions of the grading permit bond upon default by the permittee. The city engineer may enter the property for the purpose of installing, by city forces or by other means, the drainage and erosion control devices shown on the approved plans, as the city engineer deems necessary to protect adjoining property from storm damage, or the city engineer may cause the owner of the site to be prosecuted as a violator of this code, or he may take both actions. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.180)


15.40.200 Lot grading – Responsibility of permittee – Protection of adjacent property.

A. For all public watercourses, the applicant shall grant or cause to be granted to the city, at the city engineer’s discretion, a drainage easement (riparian buffers and corridors) in accordance with the requirements of the city engineer prior to the issuance of a grading permit, or prior to the approval of a grading plan.

B. For all private watercourses, including brow ditches, where the continuous functioning of the drainage way is essential to the protection and use of multiple properties, a covenant, a maintenance agreement and/or deed restriction shall be recorded by the applicant, placing the responsibility for the maintenance of the drainage way(s) on the owners of record of each respective lot affected. Permanent off-site drainage or flowage easements, as required by the city engineer, shall be acquired by the applicant. Such easements shall be subject to approval by the city engineer and recorded prior to approval of the grading plan, or issuance of a grading permit.

C. No manmade dams, ponds, diversions, flow decelerators or excessive vegetation shall be placed, allowed to be placed, or allowed to grow within the property subject to an approved grading plan, or a grading permit, without suitable provisions, as approved by the city engineer, for maintenance. Erosion or siltation as a result of these features shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner.

D. The permittee has the right to the proper discharge of natural drainage, within the provisions of this division, into natural drainage courses. The quantity of peak runoff shall be limited to the quantity of peak runoff of predevelopment conditions. This includes the right to discharge, within natural basins, runoff due to decrease of permeability of the property from grading operations, landscaping, and the construction of improvements and to discharge a reasonable silt load in this runoff comparable to the historic, predevelopment condition. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008)


15.40.210 Lot grading – Safety precautions.

A. If, at any stage of work for which an approved grading plan, or a grading permit, is required, the city engineer determines that authorized grading is likely to endanger any public or private property or result in the deposition of debris on any public way or interfere with any existing drainage course, the city engineer may specify and require reasonable safety precautions to avoid the danger. The permittee may be responsible for removing excess soil and debris deposited upon adjacent and downstream public or private property resulting from his/her grading operations. Soil and debris shall be removed and damage to adjacent and downstream property repaired as directed by the city engineer. Erosion and siltation control shall require temporary or permanent siltation basins, energy dissipaters, or other measures as field conditions warrant, whether or not such measures are a part of approved plans. Cost associated with any work outlined in this section shall be incurred by the permittee.

B. No off-site work will be required when, in the opinion of the city engineer, the permittee has properly implemented and maintained erosion control measures and the deposition of soil and debris or erosion on adjacent properties is the direct or indirect result of actions of the downstream property owner. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008)


15.40.220 Minimum BMPs for land disturbance activities.

All dischargers engaged in land disturbance activities shall implement BMPs as detailed in the city’s current Jurisdictional Urban Runoff Management Program (JURMP) as applicable to the project. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008)


15.40.230 Grading inspection and supervision – Controlled or regular grading restrictions.

A. Controlled or Regular Grading. All grading involving a fill intended to support structures, or the development of more than one lot or parcel of land, or in excess of 5,000 cubic yards of material, or grading where the city engineer determines special conditions or unusual hazards exist shall be performed under the observation of a civil engineer and shall be designated “controlled grading.” Grading other than controlled grading shall be designated “regular grading.”

B. Regular Grading Requirements. The city engineer, or his designee, upon notification from the permittee or his agent, shall inspect the grading at the following stages of the work and shall either approve the portion then completed, or shall notify the permittee or his agent wherein it fails to comply with the requirements of this code:

1. Initial. Where the site has been cleared of vegetation, unapproved fills and scarified, benched or otherwise prepared, but before any fill is placed;

2. Rough. When the grading has been completed and approximated final elevations have been established; drainage terraces, swales and other drainage devices graded ready for paving; and berms installed at the top of the slopes;

3. Final. When grading has been completed; all drainage devices installed; slope planting established and irrigation systems installed.

4. In addition to the called inspections specified in subsections (B)(1) through (3) of this section, the city engineer may make such other inspections as he may deem necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this code. Investigations and reports by an approved soil testing agency and/or geologist may be required in the discretion of the city engineer at any stage of the grading.

C. Controlled Grading Requirements. It shall be the responsibility of the grading engineer to observe the grading operations and to coordinate site inspection and testing to assure compliance of the work with the approved grading plans, the recommendations of the soils engineer geologist and the requirements of this code. He shall submit periodic progress reports as required by the city engineer. At the completion of the various stages of the work specified in subsection B of this section, he shall verify in writing that the work is in compliance with this chapter. The verification for that portion of work concerning the preparation of the existing ground surface and placing and compaction of fills may be made by the soils engineer for the soil testing agency. The city engineer may require sufficient inspections by the geologist to assure that all geological conditions have been adequately considered and recommended corrective measures incorporated in the work. All necessary reports, compaction data and soils engineering or engineering geological recommendations made during the grading operation shall be submitted to the city engineer by the grading engineer.

D. Requirements Prior to Release of Bonds. Prior to the release of bonds, the following requirements shall be met:

1. Private Engineer. The private engineer shall be responsible for all surveying work necessary for proper construction of the drainage and grading facilities. He shall inspect the site to ensure that the embankment and cut slopes are placed at their proper line and grade.

3. A report by the engineering geologist which shall be based on an as-built geologic map which report shall include specific approval of the grading as affected by geological factors. Where necessary, such report shall include geologic cross-sections and recommendations regarding the location of buildings or sewage disposal systems.

B. Final Approval. Final approval of grading shall not be given until all maps and reports that may be, by the city engineer, required by subsection A of this section have been submitted and approved. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.210. Formerly 15.40.220)


15.40.260 Appeals.

An applicant may appeal to the city engineer’s denial of, or the conditions of approval of, an application for a permit to the city council within 10 working days after such decision. Appeals shall be in writing and shall state the specific nature of the appeal. Appeals shall be filed with the city clerk. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.220. Formerly 15.40.230)


15.40.270 Depositing materials upon public or private property.

A. No person shall dump, move or place any earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone or other graded, filled or excavated material, or leave any bank, slope or other excavated surface unprotected so as to cause any of such materials to be deposited upon or to roll, blow or wash upon or over the premises of another without the express consent of the owner of each such premises so affected or upon or over any public property, place or way. Such consent shall be in writing and in a form acceptable to the city engineer.

B. No person shall, when hauling any earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone or other excavated material over any place, allow such materials to blow or spill over and upon such street, alley or place or adjacent private property.

C. When, due to a violation of subsection A of this section, any earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone or other excavated material is caused to be deposited upon or to roll, flow or wash upon any public place or way, the person responsible therefor shall cause the same to be removed from such public place or way within 36 hours. In the event it is not so removed, the city engineer shall cause such removal and the cost of such removal by the city engineer shall be paid to the city by the person who failed to so remove the material. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.230. Formerly 15.40.240)


15.40.280 Violations.

A. Any grading commenced or done contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or other violation of this chapter, shall be, and the same is declared to be, a public nuisance. Upon request of the city engineer, the city attorney shall commence necessary proceedings for the abatement of any such public nuisance in the manner provided by law. Any failure, refusal or neglect to obtain a permit as required by this chapter shall be prima facie evidence of the fact that a public nuisance has been committed in connection with any grading commenced or done contrary to the provisions of this chapter.

1. In the event that grading is commenced without a permit, the city engineer shall cause such work to be stopped until a permit is obtained. The permit fee, in such instance, shall then be double that which would normally be required. The payment of such double fee shall not relieve the person from fully complying with the requirements of this chapter and the performance of the work. Such fee shall not be construed to be a penalty, but for enforcement of the provisions of this chapter in such cases.

2. In the event that any grading is commenced or done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or of the grading permit, the city engineer may cause to be recorded with the county recorder a notice of grading violation for the property. The city engineer shall cause the notice of grading violation to be removed when the city engineer determines that the violation no longer exists.

B. Each person, firm or corporation who commences or does any grading contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or otherwise violates the provisions of this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Every day during any portion of which any violation of any provisions of this title is committed, continued or permitted by such person, firm or corporation shall be deemed a separate violation and shall be punishable as provided in Chapter 1.16 SBMC. (Ord. 381 § 1, 2008; Ord. 74 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 11.40.250. Formerly 15.40.250)

The following provisions shall apply to every swimming pool located on any lot or parcel of one acre or less, and to every hotel, motel, apartment house, planned residential development, mobile home park, planned mobile home development and public swimming pool within the city:

A. Fence Required. In order to obstruct access thereto by persons other than the owners or occupants of the premises on which a swimming pool is located, every swimming pool shall be enclosed by a natural barrier, retaining wall, fence or other structure having a minimum height of five feet measured from the exterior grade of said barrier, wall, fence or structure. Said barrier, wall, fence or structure shall be constructed or installed so as to prevent ladder-like access and shall have no horizontal openings greater than five inches.

B. Gates. Such fences may include gates therein. All gates must be self-closing and self-latching, with latches placed at least four feet six inches above the grade immediately below the latch in order to be securely closed. All gates opening through such enclosure shall be kept securely closed and latched at all times.

C. Ingress and Egress. Such fence, gate or other protective device as required by this section shall be installed in such a manner as to comply with the fire exit requirements specified in the Uniform Fire Code and with state law. No swimming pool shall be installed in any court or yard if such a pool would interfere with ingress and egress to any building or occupancy.

1. That the site in which the swimming pool is contained is a mobile home park, certified by the owner to be restricted to adult residents only, and alternate safeguards or conditions exist whereby entry into said swimming pool may be restricted or prevented;

2. That the physical conditions of the site would make the erection of a fence or wall impractical;

3. That the proposed limitation of access or conditions of control which would be continually effective would accomplish the intent of the fencing requirements. Application for modification shall be accompanied by a fee established by city council resolution.

E. Waiver. Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the owner of any swimming pool may request of the community development director a waiver of all, or a portion of, the fencing requirements contained in this chapter when the following conditions exist:

1. A plot map is submitted to the community development director showing all parcels of land lying within 1,000 feet of the perimeter of the subject property;

2. Said map identifies all swimming pools existing within said area;

3. The number of such pools exceeds five;

4. Fifty percent of the pools identified on said map:

a. Are exempt from the fencing requirements of this chapter due to their construction prior to June 18, 1976,

15.48.010 Title.

This chapter shall be known as the “Solana Beach Regional Transportation Congestion Improvement Program Ordinance.” (Ord. 383 § 2, 2008)


15.48.020 Findings.

In adopting this chapter, the city council of the city of Solana Beach finds and determines that:

A. The city is a member agency of the San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), a joint powers agency consisting of the city, the county of San Diego, and the 17 other cities situated in San Diego County. Acting in concert, the member agencies of SANDAG developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional arterial system of highways and arterials in San Diego County (the “regional arterial system”) could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee on future residential development. As a member agency of SANDAG, the city participated in the preparation of a certain “RTCIP Impact Fee Nexus Study,” dated November 26, 2006 (the “Nexus Study”) prepared pursuant to California Government Code Section 66000 et seq., the Mitigation Fee Act. 

B. The city council has been informed and advised, and finds, that future development within San Diego County and the cities therein will result in traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the regional arterial system as it presently exists.

C. The city council has been further informed and advised, and finds, that if the capacity of the regional arterial system is not enlarged, the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of San Diego County and the city, with unacceptable levels of service throughout San Diego County by 2030.

D. The city council has been further advised, and so finds, that funding, in addition to those fees adopted pursuant to the Nexus Study, will be inadequate to fund construction of the regional arterial system. Absent implementation of a regional transportation improvement plan (“RTCIP”) fee based on the Nexus Study, existing and known future funding sources will be inadequate to provide necessary improvements to the regional arterial system, resulting in an unacceptably high level of traffic congestion within and around San Diego County and the city.

E. The city council has reviewed the Nexus Study, and finds that future development within the county and city will substantially adversely affect the regional arterial system, and that unless such development contributes to the cost of improving the regional arterial system, the regional arterial system will operate at unacceptable levels of service.

F. The city council finds and determines that the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional arterial system within San Diego County and the city will substantially impair the ability of public safety services (police and fire) to respond. The failure to mitigate impacts on the regional arterial system will adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare.

G. The city council further finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the RTCIP fee and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety, health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development projects on which the RTCIP fee will be levied.

H. The city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional arterial system and the type of development projects on which the RTCIP fee is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential users of such projects to have access to the regional arterial system. Such development will benefit from the regional arterial system improvements and the burden of such development will be mitigated in part by the payment of the RTCIP fee.

I. The city council further finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the Nexus Study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional arterial system improvements, and that the amount of the RTCIP fee expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development.

J. The city council further finds that the cost estimates set forth in the Nexus Study are reasonable cost estimates for the facilities that comprise the regional arterial system, and that RTCIP fee program revenues to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share of these costs.

K. The fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to help pay for the construction and acquisition of the regional arterial system improvements identified in the Nexus Study. The need for the improvements is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic, thus creating the demand for the improvements.

L. The city council finds that the Nexus Study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements to the regional arterial system.

M. The city council adopts the Nexus Study and incorporates it in this chapter as though set forth in full. (Ord. 383 § 2, 2008)

G. Credit. Regional arterial system improvements may be credited toward the RTCIP fee in accordance with the RTCIP administrative plan and the following:

1. Regional Tier.

a. Arterial Credits. If a developer funds or constructs arterial improvements identified on SANDAG’s regional arterial system and/or that arise out of SANDAG’s congestion management program, the developer shall receive credit for all costs associated with the arterial improvements, offsetting the revenue requirements of the RTCIP administrative plan.

b. Other Credits. In special circumstances, when a developer constructs off-site improvements such as an interchange, bridge, or railroad grade separation, credits shall be determined by the city in consultation with the developer. 

c. The amount of the development fee credit shall not exceed the revenue requirements of the city’s most current funding program (determined by the most current unit cost assumptions) for its share of the regional arterial system or actual costs, whichever is less.

2. Local Tier.

a. The city shall compare facilities in local fee programs against the regional arterial system and eliminate any overlap in its local fee program except where a recognized financing district has been established.

b. If there is a recognized financing district established, the city may credit that portion of the facility identified in both programs against the RTCIP fee in accordance with the RTCIP administrative plan. (Ord. 383 § 2, 2008)


15.48.050 Reimbursements.

Should a developer construct regional arterial system improvements in excess of the RTCIP fee obligation, the developer may be reimbursed based on actual costs or the approved unit cost assumptions, whichever is less. Reimbursements shall be enacted through a three party agreement including the developer, SANDAG and the city, contingent on funds being available. In all cases, however, reimbursements under such special agreements must coincide with construction of the transportation improvements as scheduled in the five-year capital improvements program adopted annually by SANDAG. (Ord. 383 § 2, 2008)


15.48.060 Procedures for the levy, collection, and disposition of fees.

A. Authority of the Public Works Department. The director of public works, or his/her designee, is authorized to levy and collect the RTCIP fee and make all determinations required by this chapter.

B. Payment. Payment of the fees shall be as follows:

1. The fees shall be paid at the time a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development project or upon final inspection, whichever come first (the “payment date”). However, this section should not be construed to prevent payment of the fees prior to issuance of an occupancy permit or final inspection. Fees may be paid at the time application is made for a building permit and the fee payment shall be calculated based on the fee in effect at that time, provided the developer tenders the full amount of his/her RTCIP fee obligation. If the developer makes only a partial payment prior to the payment date, the amount of the fee due shall be based on the RTCIP fee schedule in place on the payment date. The fees shall be calculated according to fee schedule set forth in the resolution and the calculation methodology set forth in Table 11 of the Nexus Study, in effect on the payment date.

2. The fees required to be paid shall be the fee amounts in effect at the time of payment is due under this chapter, not the date the ordinance approving this chapter is initially adopted. The city shall not enter into a development agreement which freezes future adjustments of the RTCIP fee.

3. If all or part of any development project is sold prior to payment of the fee, the property shall continue to be subject to the requirement for payment of the fee. Accordingly, the fees shall run with the land.

4. Fees shall not be waived.

C. Disposition of Fees. All fees collected hereunder shall be transmitted to a fund established and designated by the city for deposit, investment, accounting and expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Mitigation Fee Act.

D. Appeals. Appeals shall be filed with the city council in accordance with the provisions of RTCIP Administrative Plan and administrative rules adopted by resolution of the city council. Issues subject to appeal shall be the application of the fee, application of credits, application of reimbursement, application of the legal action stay and application of exemption.

E. Reports to SANDAG. The finance director, or his/her designee, shall prepare and deliver to the executive director of SANDAG and to the Independent Taxpayer Oversight Committee (ITOC) periodic reports as will be established under SBMC 15.48.070. (Ord. 383 § 2, 2008)


15.48.070 RTCIP fee administrator.

A. The director of public works is appointed as the administrator of the transportation uniform mitigation fee program. He or she, or designee, is authorized to receive all fees generated from the RTCIP fee within the city, and to invest, account for and expend such fees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Mitigation Fee Act. The detailed administrative procedures concerning the implementation of this chapter shall be contained in the RTCIP administrative plan. Furthermore, the RTCIP administrator shall use the Nexus Study for the purpose of calculating a developer’s RTCIP fee obligation. In addition to detailing the methodology for calculating all RTCIP fee obligations of different categories of new development, the purpose of the Nexus Study is to clarify for the RTCIP administrator, where necessary, the definition and calculation methodology for uses not clearly defined in this chapter.

B. The city shall expend only that amount of the funds generated from the RTCIP fee for staff support, audit, administrative expenses, and contract services that are necessary and reasonable to carry out its responsibilities and in no case shall the funds expended for salaries and benefits exceed two percent of the annual net amount of revenue raised by the RTCIP fee. The RTCIP administrative plan further outlines the fiscal responsibilities and limitations of the administrator. (Ord. 383 § 2, 2008)

15.50.010 Title. 

This chapter shall be known as the Transportation Impact Fee (“TIF”) Ordinance and may be cited as such. (Ord. 479 § 2, 2017)


15.50.020 Authority. 

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, California Government Code Section 66000 et seq. (Ord. 479 § 2, 2017)


15.50.030 Intent and purpose. 

The purpose of this chapter is to make provision for assessing and collecting transportation impact fees as a condition of project approval of a subdivision map or prior to issuance of a development permit, including a building permit, in order to fund the construction of identified facilities needed to reduce or mitigate the projected cumulative transportation impacts resulting from such development and in order to allocate the costs of these facilities equitably among future developing properties. Application of this fee will include, but is not limited to, development for residential, commercial and industrial land uses. 

This TIF does not replace normal subdivision map exactions or other measures required to mitigate site specific impacts of a development project including, but not limited to, mitigation imposed pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act and imposed as conditions of approval upon a development project as part of the development review process; regulatory and processing fees; transportation uniform mitigation fees; fees required pursuant to a development agreement; funds collected pursuant to a reimbursement agreement that exceed the developer’s share of public improvement costs; or assessment district proceedings, benefit assessments, or taxes. 

The fees collected pursuant to this chapter are to fund identified transportation facilities, or portions thereof, that will mitigate the cumulative transportation impacts attributable to future development in the city. TIF funds will be used for the specific improvements, as identified in the TIF report, which are needed to accommodate future growth in the city. (Ord. 479 § 2, 2017)


15.50.040  Findings. 

The city council of the city of Solana Beach, consistent with California Government Code Section 66000 et seq. of the Mitigation Fee Act, finds that: 

A. Purpose of the Fee. The purpose of the TIF is to fund construction of transportation facilities in response to the anticipated cumulative impacts associated with future development and redevelopment within the city.

B. Use of the Fee. The TIF will be used to fund construction of specifically identified transportation facilities, or portions thereof, in accordance with the circulation element of the city’s general plan. Costs funded may include program administration, project administration and management, design and engineering, regulatory compliance, and construction.

C. Reasonable Use (Benefit). Future development and redevelopment will have significant cumulative impacts on the city’s transportation system. These impacts would be difficult to mitigate on a project-by-project basis. The TIF will be used to fund additional transportation infrastructure to accommodate future development and redevelopment, facilitating greater multimodal circulation within the city, as a means of mitigating overall cumulative impacts.

D. Reasonable Need (Burden). Future development and redevelopment will place additional burdens on the city’s transportation system. The cost apportionment methodology, based on TDUs, uses person trip intensity and trip length to allocate the cost of improvements to the various types of development. The costs and corresponding fee allocations account for differing impacts based on land use type, demonstrating a reasonable relationship between the type of development and the need for the improvements.

E. Reasonable Apportionment. The reasonable relationship between the TIF for a specific development and the cost attributable to the development is based on the estimated person trips and miles of travel the development will add to the city’s transportation system. The TIF allocates the cost of specifically identified transportation facilities, or portions thereof, to development based on land use, and corresponding TDUs, in relation to the development’s proportionate share of the total TDUs for all development. (Ord. 479 § 2, 2017)


15.50.050 Definitions. 

The definitions set forth in this section shall govern the application and interpretation of this chapter: 

“Applicant” means developer or person seeking a development permit. 

“Building permit” means a permit required and issued by the city of Solana Beach. 

“City” means the city of Solana Beach.

The TIF is limited to providing funding in the amounts and for those improvements specified in the city of Solana Beach transportation impact fee program. Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the ability of the city to require dedication of land, payment of fees or construction of improvements for needs other than, or in addition to, the improvements specified in the city of Solana Beach transportation impact fee program. 

The requirement of this chapter shall apply to projects for which building permits are issued on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 479 § 2, 2017)


15.50.070 Transportation impact fee requirement. 

A. Prior to the issuance of any building permit for new development or redevelopment in the city of Solana Beach, a transportation impact fee shall be paid based upon the use of land set forth in the fee rate table included in the TIF report.

B. The fee shall be paid before the issuance of building permits for each development project within the city of Solana Beach. No building permit shall be issued within the city of Solana Beach unless and until the TIF has been paid in full. In the case of discretionary permits that will not involve a building permit, but which will involve new development, payment of the fee shall be recommended as a condition of permitting to the decision-making body that would approve such permit. (Ord. 479 § 2, 2017)


15.50.080 Annual adjustment of fees. 

The TIF may be adjusted annually starting July 1, 2018, and on each July 1st thereafter, based on the following factors: 

A. The cost of construction based on the Los Angeles Construction Cost Index. 

B. Changes in the type, size, location or cost of the transportation facilities, if any, to be financed by the TIF, changes in land use designations in the city’s general plan, and upon other sound engineering, financing, and planning information. 

C. Adjustments to the TIF resulting from review of the factors above may be made by resolution amending the fee schedule and subject to compliance with the Mitigation Fee Act. 

D. Adjustments to the fees resulting from the annual review may be made by resolution amending the fee rate tables contained in the TIF report and subject to the notice and public meeting requirements of Government Code Section 66016. (Ord. 479 § 2, 2017)

15.60.010 Title.

This chapter shall be known as the Fire Mitigation Impact Fee (FMIF) Ordinance and may be cited as such. (Ord. 492 § 3, 2018)


15.60.020 Authority.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, California Government Code Section 66000 et seq. (Ord. 492 § 3, 2018)


15.60.030 Intent and purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to make provision for assessing and collecting fire mitigation impact fees as a condition of project approval of a subdivision map or prior to issuance of a development permit, including a building permit, in order to fund the additional fire equipment and facility that help mitigate the additional demand.

The fees collected pursuant to this chapter are to fund additional fire equipment and emergency response vehicles, a vehicle storage facility, a traffic preemption equipment system, and if needed, the expansion of the existing station (to increase the response capacity of that station). Additional fire suppression/rescue capabilities are planned to come on-line, as needed, as development creates anticipated increases in detached and attached units, and increases in square feet for retail/service, office, industrial and institutional uses and some additional commercial lodging rooms per the general plan. The proposed additions are based upon anticipated new call demand and the relative distance from the existing stations. (Ord. 492 § 3, 2018)


15.60.040 Findings.

The city council of the city of Solana Beach, consistent with California Government Code Sections 66000 et seq. of the Mitigation Fee Act, finds that:

A. Purpose of the Fee. The purpose of the FMIF is to maintain currently met standards by determining the cost of additional fire equipment, emergency response vehicles, the construction of a storage building for the vehicle, and the investment in a traffic signal preemption system to better manage response times and mitigate additional demand.

B. Use of the Fee. The FMIF will be used to fund acquisition of additional fire equipment, emergency response vehicles, a storage building for the vehicles, a traffic preemption equipment system, and if needed, the expansion of the existing station (to increase the response capacity of that station in response to the anticipated cumulative impacts associated with future development and redevelopment within the city).

C. Reasonable Use (Benefit). The FMIF will be used to ensure fire service response standards extended to new development are consistent with the fire response currently received by the city’s existing citizens and business community. Additional construction and equipment acquisition will maintain the current level of service (LOS) for both existing residents and future citizens and businesses within the city of Solana Beach.

D. Reasonable Need (Burden). The use of the FMIF is equivalent to the need for the fee. The FMIF would be collected as the development occurs (generally at building permit or some predetermined point in the process). As the development occurs, the impact is generated. The collected FMIF receipts would be put to use to acquire additional specialty equipment, emergency response vehicle and an additional building necessary to respond to those additional calls for service, without reducing the capability of responding to calls from the existing community.

E. Reasonable Apportionment. The reasonable relationship between the FMIF for a specific development and the cost attributable to the development is based on the costs involved in the pro rata expansion of the city’s fire suppression/rescue facilities, vehicles and equipment. The resulting development impact fees are based upon these costs distributed by land use demands and maintain proportionality with the existing development and existing inventory of fire suppression/rescue assets. (Ord. 492 § 3, 2018)

15.65.010 Title.

This chapter shall be known as the Park Development Impact Fee (“PDIF”) Ordinance and may be cited as such. (Ord. 493 § 2, 2018)


15.65.020 Authority.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, California Government Code Section 66000 et seq. (Ord. 493 § 2, 2018)


15.65.030 Intent and purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to make a provision for assessing and collecting park development impact fees as a condition of project approval of a subdivision map or prior to issuance of a development permit, including a building permit, in order to fund the acquisition and construction of identified park land and park improvements needed to accommodate the added demands created by the construction of additional residential dwelling units through general plan buildout at the existing standard.

The fees collected pursuant to this chapter are to fund acquisition of additional park land and construction of additional park improvements that directly benefit new city residents or for creating enhancements to the existing park infrastructure, but would not be expended upon the rehabilitation of any existing park infrastructure. The collected park impact fee receipts could not be used for rehabilitation of any existing park infrastructure. (Ord. 493 § 2, 2018)


15.65.040 Findings.

The city council of the city of Solana Beach, consistent with California Government Code Sections 66000 et seq. of the Mitigation Fee Act, finds that:

A. Purpose of the Fee. The purpose of the PDIF is to maintain currently met standards by determining the cost of expanding park land and park-related improvements by a proportional amount necessary to accommodate the added demands created by the construction of additional residential dwelling units through general plan build-out at the existing standard.

B. Use of the Fee. The PDIF will be used to fund acquisition of additional park land and construction of additional park improvements in response to the anticipated cumulative impacts associated with future development and redevelopment within the city.

C. Reasonable Use (Benefit). The PDIF will be used to expand the amount of park offerings in proportions consistent with the average persons per dwelling by type of residential dwelling. Park offerings would be expanded by type of residential dwelling as different types of residential dwellings generally have differing numbers of people dwelling in them.

D. Reasonable Need (Burden). Residential development creates housing for additional residents who are likely to use the existing facilities, thereby limiting the access to existing residents. The PDIF will be used to maintain the existing standards to protect the access to existing park offerings to the city’s existing residents. The relationship is based upon the average number of persons that reside in the various types of residential construction.

E. Reasonable Apportionment. The reasonable relationship between the PDIF for a specific development and the cost attributable to the development is based on the costs involved in the pro rata expansion of the city’s park-related infrastructure. The resulting development impact fees are based upon these costs per individual resident multiplied by the average number of residents residing in each of the two major types of dwelling unit (detached and attached). (Ord. 493 § 2, 2018)

5. At the time of making a dedication or offer of dedication, the subdivider shall either (1) warrant that all property dedicated or offered for dedication is free from hazardous or toxic waste or material, or other environmental contamination of which the subdivider has knowledge or reasonably should have knowledge through ownership of the property or through a reasonable investigation conducted in due diligence to discover the existence of such waste, material or contamination; or (2) if the subdivider cannot make the warranty referred to herein, disclose to the public agency to whom the dedication or offer of dedication is made the nature and extent of any hazardous or toxic waste or material, or environmental contamination of which the subdivider has knowledge or has discovered through an investigation of the subject property, and shall submit a plan for approval by the public agency to which the property is to be dedicated whereby the subdivider will mitigate or remedy any effects of the waste, material or contamination on the property as required by any public agency with jurisdiction over the mitigation or remediation of such effects to the extent necessary to put the subject property into a condition that it may be used for its intended purpose by the public agency to whom it is dedicated or offered for dedication. The agency to which the property is to be dedicated may require the subdivider to complete any mitigation or remediation plan before the offer of dedication is accepted. 

B. The subdivider may file a protest in accordance with Section 66475.4 of the Subdivision Map Act, at the time of the imposition of a dedication requirement or within the time established by this title for an appeal of a decision. The city council shall hold a public hearing to determine if the protested requirement is excessive. If the dedication requirement is determined to be excessive, the city council may require amendment of the tentative subdivision map, redesign of the subdivision, pay just compensation, or delete or modify the dedication found to be excessive. A dedication requirement is excessive to the extent it is not reasonably necessary to meet public needs arising as a result of the subdivision. This section shall not apply to dedications imposed to mitigate identified adverse environmental impacts on the project or imposed pursuant to the provisions of a specific plan or a plan adopted pursuant to the city zoning provisions, or as a condition of a zoning approval. “Dedication” shall have the meaning established by Section 66475.4 of the Subdivision Map Act. (Ord. 149 § 2, 1992; Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.050 Required improvements.

A. No final map shall be approved, whether by the city council or otherwise, unless the following requirements have been met:

1. The subdivider shall grade and improve or agree to grade and improve all land dedicated or to be dedicated for streets or other improvements, bicycle routes and all private streets and private easements shown on or required by the tentative map, in accordance with city standards;

2. The subdivider shall install, or agree to install, all drainage and flood control structures and facilities as required by the city engineer, in conformance with city standards or the standards of other appropriate agencies as the city engineer adopts;

3. The subdivider shall install, or agree to install, fire hydrants and connections of a type and location approved by the city fire chief. Fire hydrant connections, including valves, shall be installed to the rear or back of the sidewalk;

4. The subdivider shall provide all necessary easements and rights-of-way to accommodate all streets, drainage and flood control structures and facilities and sewer systems extending beyond the boundaries of the subdivision;

5. The subdivider shall provide for the subdivision to be connected to a domestic water system approved by the city and all water mains shall be of a material subject to the requirements of the water company or agency serving the subdivision. The subdivider shall install, or agree to install, all required water systems necessary to serve the subdivision and that all water lines, appurtenances and service connections shall be constructed or laid prior to paving of streets; and

6. The subdivider shall install, or agree to install, sewer lines of a type and size approved by the city engineer to the property line of each lot within the subdivision and all sanitary sewer lines, appurtenances and service connections have been constructed or laid prior to paving or provisions have been made to ensure the construction.

B. If an offer of dedication of streets delineated on the map is rejected, surfacing in accordance with all applicable city standards shall be required on any street so rejected before occupancy of any lots within the subdivision, unless otherwise determined by the city council; provided, however, this provision shall not be construed as relieving the subdivider of the obligation of:

1. Grading such rejected streets to grades and widths required by city standards;

2. Installing all drainage structures and facilities required by the city engineer or by the tentative map approval;

3. Installing water supply pipelines, fire hydrants and connections as may be required by the city engineer and fire chief;

4. Installing sanitary sewer facilities as may be required by the city engineer.

C. No surfacing is required on any private street laid out on any parcel map where each parcel shown on such map contains a gross area of 20 acres or more; provided, however, this provision shall not be construed as relieving a subdivider of the obligation of:

1. Grading such private streets to grades and widths required by city standards;

2. Installing all drainage structures and facilities required by the city engineer, which shall conform to city standards; and

3. Installing water supply pipelines, fire hydrants and connections as may be required.

Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the city engineer from requiring surfacing or other measures as will assure all weather access to any parcel or lot prior to any building materials being placed on such parcel or lot.

D. 1. All new utility distribution facilities, including cable, television, conduit and lines within the boundaries of any new subdivision or within the half street abutting a new subdivision shall be placed underground. All existing utility distribution facilities within the boundaries of any new subdivision or within any half street abutting any new subdivision shall be placed underground; provided, that performance of the requirement may be deferred if the city engineer or city council determines that it is not feasible to place the existing facilities underground within any single half street section due to the existence of overhead utility services to properties on the opposite side of that half street section, or such other circumstances as the city engineer or city council deem controlling. In cases where the requirement to place existing facilities underground is deferred, the subdivider shall execute and record a covenant running with the land to perform the undergrounding at such future time as the city engineer or city council may determine, which agreement shall be secured by security described in SBMC 16.16.070 or by an agreement in a form satisfactory to the city attorney establishing a lien on the property which is the subject of the subdivision in an amount estimated by the city engineer to be the cost of the undergrounding work. The security instrument shall also provide for increases in the amount of the security sufficient to cover the actual cost of construction at the future date when the installation of the improvements are required. Agreement for installation of the improvements shall provide that the subdivider shall install the improvements at such future time as the facts justifying the basis for deferral no longer exists or at such other time as determined necessary by the city engineer or city council.

2. In developments where existing overhead utility distribution facilities are allowed to remain, all new services to existing lots and lots created according to the provisions of this title shall be installed underground from the nearest utility pole.

3. The subdivider is responsible for complying with the requirements of this subsection and he shall make the necessary arrangements with each of the serving utilities, including franchised cable television operators, for the installation of such facilities. Transformers, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, concealed ducts and other facilities necessarily appurtenant to such underground utilities and street lighting systems may be placed above ground, subject to approval of the city engineer as to type and location. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the installation and maintenance of overhead electrical transmission lines in excess of 64,000 volts and long distance and trunk communication facilities. The installation of cable television lines may be waived when, in the opinion of the city council, no franchised cable television operator is found to be willing and able to install cable television lines in the subdivision. Notwithstanding any such waiver, the installation of cable television conduits is required.

E. Unless otherwise approved by the city, all utility facilities shall be placed in the street right-of-way or other easement dedicated to the city for utility purposes.

F. The subdivider shall construct, or cause to be constructed, at his cost, a street lighting system conforming to city standards.

G. Where the city has adopted a flood control element or drainage element of the general plan, any improvements shall conform to such element wherever possible.

H. The subdivider shall comply, or agree to comply, with all the conditions of approval contained in the resolution approving the tentative map and not otherwise provided for by this section.

I. If the improvements are required for a designated remainder parcel, the fulfillment of such requirements by the construction of improvements shall not be required until such time as a building or grading permit for development of the parcel is issued by the city or until such time as the construction of such improvements is required pursuant to an agreement between the subdivider and the city. In the absence of such an agreement, the city council may require fulfillment of some or all of such construction requirements within a reasonable time following approval of the final map and prior to the issuance of a building or grading permit for the development of a remainder parcel upon a finding that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for reasons of public health and safety or that the construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area. (Ord. 115 § 1, 1990; Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.055 Supplemental improvements – Required.

A. The subdivider may be required to install improvements for the benefit of the subdivision which may contain supplemental size, capacity, number or length for the benefit of property not within the subdivision as a condition precedent to the approval of a subdivision or parcel map and, thereafter, to dedicate such improvements to the public. However, when such supplemental size, capacity, number or length is solely for the benefit of property not within the subdivision, the city shall enter into an agreement with the subdivider to reimburse the subdivider for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such improvements pursuant to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, or in the alternative, enter into such other agreement or procedure which will assure that said difference is paid or agreed to be paid by the owners of such other benefited property.

B. The city manager or city council on appeal shall determine the method for payment of the costs required by a reimbursement agreement which may include, but is not limited to, the establishment and maintenance of local benefit districts for the levy and collection of such charge or costs from the property benefited. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.056 Supplemental improvements – Reimbursement agreement – Funding procedures.

A. No charge within the area of benefit shall be levied and no local benefit district shall be established unless and until a public hearing is held thereon by the body charged with ruling on the tentative map and such body finds that the fee or charge and the area of benefit or local benefit district is reasonably related to the cost of such supplemental improvements and the actual ultimate beneficiaries thereof.

B. In addition to the notice required by Government Code Section 66451.3, written notice of the hearing shall be given to the subdivider and to those who own property within the proposed area of benefit as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll, and the potential users of the supplemental improvements insofar as they can be ascertained at the time. Such notices shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, by the city clerk at least 10 days prior to the date established for the hearing. The failure to receive such mailed notice shall not invalidate the proceedings or agreement. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.057 Supplemental improvements – Drainage, sewerage, bridges and major thoroughfares.

If the city has adopted a local drainage or sanitary sewer plan or map as required for the imposition of fees therefor, or has established an area of benefit for bridges or major thoroughfares as provided in Chapter 16.08 SBMC, the city may impose a reasonable charge on property within the area benefited and may provide for the collection of said charge as set forth in Chapter 16.08 SBMC. The city may enter into reimbursement agreements with a subdivider who constructs said facilities, bridges, or thoroughfares and the charges collected by the city therefor may be utilized to reimburse the subdivider. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.060 Agreement to improve.

Unless the conditions of the tentative map approval require the subdivider to construct improvements prior to final map approval, the subdivider may elect to agree to construct improvements or to otherwise comply with the requirements of this title and with the conditions in the resolution approving the tentative map or, if authorized by the city council, may contract to initiate and consummate special assessment or special taxing district proceedings in lieu of constructing improvements, as provided in Subdivision Map Act Section 66462. If the subdivider consents, or the city council requires pursuant to SBMC 16.16.040, the agreement may provide for the improvements for a designated remainder parcel prior to issuance of a building or grading permit for such parcel. In addition, the subdivider shall prepare and deposit with the city engineer detailed plans and specifications of the improvement to be constructed or the conditions to be met. The plans and specifications shall be made a part of any such agreement or contract and of the improvement security securing the same. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the city attorney. The city manager is authorized to sign such agreements on behalf of the city. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.070 Improvement security – Required.

The improvement agreement referred to in SBMC 16.16.060 shall be secured by one of the following:

A. A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized incorporated sureties substantially in the form prescribed by Subdivision Map Act Sections 66499.1 and 66499.2;

F. Whenever an entity required to furnish security is a California nonprofit corporation funded by the United States of America or one of its agencies, or the state of California or one of its agencies, the entity shall not be required to comply with subsections A or B of this section; provided, that the conditions established by Government Code Section 66499.3(c) exist. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.090 Improvement security – Release.

The improvement security required under this chapter shall be released in the following manner:

A. Security given for faithful performance of any act or agreement shall be released upon the final completion and acceptance of the required act or work, subject to the provisions of subsection B of this section.

B. The city engineer may release a portion of the security in conjunction with the acceptance of the performance of the act or work as it progresses upon application therefor by the subdivider; provided, however, that no such release shall be for an amount less than 25 percent of the total improvement security given for faithful performance of the act or work and that the security shall not be reduced to an amount less than 50 percent of the total improvement security given for faithful performance until final completion and acceptance of the required act or work. In no event shall the city engineer authorize a release of the improvement security which would reduce such security to an amount below that required to guarantee the completion of the required act or work and any other obligation imposed by this title, the Subdivision Map Act or the improvement agreement.

C. Security given to secure payment to the contractor, his subcontractors and to persons furnishing labor, materials or equipment shall, six months after the completion and acceptance of the act or work, be reduced to an amount equal to the amount of all claims therefor filed and, of which notice has been given to the legislative body plus an amount reasonably determined by the city engineer to be required to assure the performance of any other obligations secured thereby.

The city clerk may return a security instrument to the person or entity which provided it upon total release of the security provided that the city clerk retains a true copy of the security instrument along with the release documents. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.100 Improvement security – Forfeiture.

Upon the failure of the subdivider to complete any improvement, or to perform any acts or obligations imposed upon the subdivider, within the time specified or upon the breach of an agreement entered into pursuant to SBMC 16.16.060, the city manager may determine that subdivider is in default and may cause the improvement security, or such portion thereof as is necessary to complete the work or act and any other obligations of the subdivider secured thereby, to be forfeited to the city. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.110 Off-site improvements – Acquisition of property interests.

Whenever a subdivider is required as a condition of a tentative map to construct or install off-site improvements on property which neither the subdivider nor the city owns, not later than 60 days prior to filing the final map for approval, the subdivider shall provide the city with sufficient information, reports and data including, but not limited to, an appraisal and title report, to enable the city to commence proceedings pursuant to Title 7 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure to acquire an interest in the land which will permit the improvements to be made, including proceedings for immediate possession of the property pursuant to Article 3 of such title. The subdivider shall agree, pursuant to SBMC 16.16.060, to complete the improvements at such time as the city has a sufficient interest in the property to permit the construction of the improvements. The subdivider shall bear all costs associated with the acquisition of the property interests and the estimated cost thereof shall be secured as provided in SBMC 16.16.070. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.16.120 Design of common interest developments.

If the design of a common interest development is subject to review and approval pursuant to the city zoning provisions, such review and approval shall be obtained prior to or concurrently with the approval of the tentative map. If the design of a common interest development is not subject to review pursuant to the city zoning provisions, the tentative map shall be accompanied by a site plan showing the design of the development.

H. A vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map shall not be approved or conditionally approved unless the city council finds on the basis of the studies and reports submitted by the subdivider, that all public facilities necessary to serve the subdivision or mitigate any impacts created by the subdivision, will be available for the entire time that the vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map is valid, plus any time during which the rights conferred by SBMC 16.17.030 exist. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.17.030 Rights conferred.

A. Approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map shall confer a right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards as described in Section 66474.2 of the Government Code. However, if Section 66474.2 is repealed, the approval shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map was approved or conditionally approved. Any disputes as to whether a development substantially complies with the approved or conditionally approved map, or with the ordinances, policies or standards described in this subsection, shall be resolved by the city council, and its determination with respect thereto shall be final.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit or entitlement for development may be conditionally approved or denied if, at the time of the issuance of the permit or approval or entitlement, it is determined by the city council:

1. A failure to condition or deny the permit or entitlement would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community or both in a condition dangerous to their health or safety or both; or

2. The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law.

Where several final maps or parcel maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map, this period shall begin for each phase when the final map or parcel map for that phase is recorded.

E. The time period set forth in subsection D of this section, shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit if such processing exceeds 30 days from the date a complete application is accepted.

F. A subdivider may apply to the city council for a one-year extension of the rights conferred by subsection D of this section at any time before the time period set forth in subsection D of this section expires. An extension may be granted only if the council finds that the map still complies with the requirements of this title and all other ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time of consideration of such extension. The city council may approve, conditionally approve or deny an extension in its sole discretion.

G. If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time set forth in subsections D through F of this section, the rights referred to therein shall continue until the expiration of that building permit or any extension of that permit.

H. Upon the expiration of the time limits specified in subsections A, D, E, F or G of this section, all rights conferred by this section shall cease and the project shall be considered as the same as any subdivision which was not processed pursuant to this chapter.

I. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the amount of any fees which are required to be paid either as a condition of the map approval or by operation of any law shall be determined by application of the law or policy in effect at the time the fee is paid. The amounts of the fees are not vested upon approval of the vesting tentative map or tentative parcel map. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.17.040 Consistency with zoning and general plan.

No vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map shall be approved if the proposed map or the design or improvement of the proposed development are not consistent with the applicable general or specific plans or with the applicable zoning provisions of this code. If development of the project for which a vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map requires any permits or approvals pursuant to the zoning provisions of this code, those permits or approvals shall be processed concurrently with the vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map. A vesting tentative map or vesting tentative parcel map shall not be approved if all other discretionary permits or approvals including, without limitation, improvement plans and final grading plans, have not been approved either prior to or concurrently with approval of the map.

16.20.020 City council to approve maps.

A. The city council shall not consider a final map unless there is a valid tentative map for the subdivision.

B. No final map shall be filed in the office of the county recorder until approved by the city council, but such map shall be disapproved only for failure to meet or perform requirements or conditions which were applicable to the subdivision at the time of approval of the tentative map; providing, that any such disapproval shall be accompanied by a finding identifying the requirements or conditions which have not been met or performed. The city council may waive any such failure of the map to meet such requirements and conditions if such failure is a result of a technical and inadvertent error which, in the determination of the city council, does not materially affect the validity of the map. The city council shall not waive any requirement or condition relating to the design or improvement of the subdivision.

C. Multiple or phased final maps may be filed for portions of the tentative map, provided that the tentative map divides a subdivision into units and each final map or phased final map substantially conforms to one or more of the units as shown on the tentative map and complies with all conditions applicable to the units. The number of official maps or phased final maps which may be filed shall be determined by the decision making authority at the time of the approval or conditional approval of the tentative map. When dividing a subdivision into units, the decision making authority shall ensure that the design and improvement of each unit is consistent with the provisions of this title. If the subdivider is subject to a requirement to construct or improve or finance the construction and improvement of public improvements outside the boundary of the subdivision, the cost of that requirement shall be established at the time the tentative map is approved. If the cost of the off-site public improvements requirement is $100,000 or more, it shall be a condition of the tentative map that additional conditions may be placed on the extension of the tentative map which occurs by operation of SBMC 16.12.110(B); and further, it shall be a condition that upon the filing of any multiple final map or phased final map, the council may modify or eliminate the phasing scheme. Multiple or phased final maps shall be authorized for vesting tentative maps for which off-site improvements are required only if the city council finds that multiple final maps are necessary to accomplish the subdivision, that all off-site improvements are required as a condition of the zoning for the property or zoning approval for the project, that phasing of the project is consistent with the city’s general plan and any development, management or public facilities ordinances, policies or regulations, and that the subdivision consists of 100 or more units.

D. The city council shall not approve a final map for a subdivision to be created from a conversion of residential real property into a common interest development project unless it finds all of the following:

The additional map sheet or sheets shall contain a statement that the additional information is for informational purposes, describing conditions as of the date of filing, and is not intended to affect record title interest. If appropriate, the additional map sheet or sheets shall list the source or sources of the information stated. The additional map sheet or sheets may contain a notation that the additional information is derived from public records or reports, and does not imply the corrections or sufficiency of those records by the preparer of the additional map sheet or sheets. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.20.070 Record of easements.

A. The final map shall show the centerline data, width and side lines of all easements to which the land is subject or to be subjected unless the easement is to be extinguished by the filing of the map pursuant to the State Subdivision Map Act.

2. Location of all permanent monuments within subdivision;

3. Ties to any city or county boundary lines involved;

4. Ties to and identification of adjacent subdivisions; and

5. Required certificates.

E. The California Coordinate System shall be used as the “basis of bearings” and all measured and calculated bearing values shall be expressed in terms of said system. The angle of grid divergence from a true meridian (gamma or mapping angle), and the north point of said map shall appear on each sheet thereof. Establishment of said basis of bearings may be by use of existing horizontal control stations meeting the standards of the California Public Resources Code.

“Basis of bearing” means the source of uniform orientation of all measured bearings shown on the map. Unless otherwise approved, this source will be the California Coordinate System (CCS 83), Zone 6.

“California Coordinate System” means the coordinate system as defined in Section 8801 through 8819 of the California Public Resources Code. The specified zone for San Diego County is “Zone 6” and the official datum is the California Coordinate System of 1983 (CCS 83), based on the “North American Datum of 1983.”

The final map shall show two measured ties from the boundary of the subject property to existing horizontal control station(s) having California Coordinate values of first order accuracy or better, as published in the county of San Diego’s horizontal control book. These tie lines to the existing control shall be shown in relation to the California Coordinate System (i.e., grid bearings and grid distances). All other distances shown on the map are to be shown as ground distances. A combined factor for conversion of grid-to-ground distances shall be shown on the map.

If there are no acceptable horizontal control stations within one-half mile of the subject property, then the engineer or land surveyor may make a written request to the city engineer for additional control stations within the subject area.

In the event the city is unable to provide an acceptable horizontal control station within one-half mile of the subject property within 30 days of written request, this requirement may be waived.

None of the above will preclude a person authorized to practice land surveying from performing the necessary work to meet the requirements of this section. (Ord. 339 § 1, 2005; Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.20.090 Lot numbers.

16.20.100 Established lines.

A. Whenever the city engineer has established the centerline of a street or alley, such data shall be considered in making the surveys and in preparing the final map, and all monuments found, shall be indicated and proper references made to field books or maps of public record, relating to the monuments. If the points were reset by ties, that fact shall be stated.

B. The final map shall show city boundaries crossing or adjoining the subdivision clearly designated and tied in. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.20.110 Additional certificates on final subdivision maps.

In addition to certificates and other material required by the Subdivision Map Act and this title, every final subdivision map shall bear the following certificates or endorsements:

An application for approval of an adjustment plat shall be filed with the city engineer accompanied by such information as the city engineer may require and by a fee established by city council resolution. That application shall also be accompanied by an adjustment plat of a size and form prescribed by the city engineer which shall bear the signature of the owners of the property involved and by a title report for the property.

A, 1989)


16.36.060 Conditions of approval.

The city engineer may impose conditions or exactions on the approval of an adjustment plat to the extent that the conditions or extractions are necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of the city’s building and zoning laws, or to facilitate the relocation of existing utilities, infrastructure or easements. The conditions imposed by the city engineer shall be satisfied prior to the recordation of the adjustment plat or such other document authorized by law to effectuate the lot line adjustment.

B. In addition to the procedures established by subsection A of this section, a lot line adjustment may be effectuated by the recordation of the deed or record of survey; provided, however, that such deed or record of survey shall not be recorded unless it contains a certification by the city engineer that all the requirements of this chapter and any condition imposed pursuant to this chapter have been satisfied and further provided that a copy of the adjustment plat shall be attached to the deed or record of survey. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.36.080 Appeal.

16.44.010 Enforcement.

Whenever the county assessor or the head of any city department finds that the provisions of this title or of the Subdivision Map Act have been violated, he shall report such violation to the director of community development and the city manager. It shall be the duty of the city manager or his or her designee to investigate such report and enforce the provisions of this title and the Subdivision Map Act. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.020 Notice of violation.

Whenever the city manager has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or of city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto, he shall cause to be filed for record with the county recorder a notice of intention to record a notice of violation, describing the real property in detail, naming the owners thereof, describing the violation, and stating that an opportunity will be given to the owner to present evidence. Upon the recording of the notice of intention to record a notice of violation, the city manager shall mail a copy of such notice to the owner of the real property. The notice shall specify a time, date and place at which the owner may present evidence to the city manager why such notice should not be recorded. If, after the owner has presented evidence, the city manager determines that there has been no violation, he shall forthwith file a release of the notice of intention to record a notice of violation with the county recorder. If, however, after the owner has presented evidence, the city manager determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, or if within 60 days of receipt of a copy of such notice the owner of such real property fails to inform the city manager of his objection to recording the notice of violation, the city manager shall record the notice of violation with the county recorder. The notice of intention to record a notice of violation and the notice of violation, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of the violation to all successors in interest in such real property. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.030 Development permits and approvals withheld.

A. The city or any other responsible agency shall not issue or grant building, grading or any other permit, or any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided or which has resulted from a division in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto applicable at the time such division occurred unless the city manager or, on appeal, the city council, finds that development of such real property is not contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is either the current owner of record or vendee of the current owner of record pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of his interests in such real property.

B. All applications for permits or approvals necessary for the development of real property shall be reviewed by the city engineer, who shall determine whether the real property has been subdivided or has resulted from a division in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto. The city engineer shall also make such a determination upon a receipt of a written request from the owner of such real property or the vendee of the current owner of record pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property or upon receipt of written notification of the authority or body responsible for granting a permit or approval. The city engineer may recommend to the city manager, or the city manager’s designee, that real property be approved for development pursuant to subsection A of this section and shall so inform the owner or vendee thereof and the authority or body authorized to issue or grant the permit or approval for development. If it is determined that such real property is approved for development, the city manager may impose those conditions that would have been applicable to the division of the property and which had been established at such time by the Subdivision Map Act or city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto and are appropriate to satisfy public health and safety considerations and other considerations as are hereinafter specified unless the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation in which event the city manager may impose such conditions as would be applicable to a current division of property. If a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record under the provisions of SBMC 16.44.040, only such conditions stipulated in that certificate shall be applicable. If real property is approved for development, the city engineer shall cause a certificate of compliance related to the subject real property and reflecting any conditions of development to be filed with the county recorder pursuant to SBMC 16.44.040.

C. In determining whether approval or conditional approval should be granted for development of real property divided or resulting from a division in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto, the city manager or the city council shall give consideration to:

1. Whether the owner of the real property can rescind the agreement by which he acquired the real property and recover the consideration paid therefor;

2. Whether the real property meets the requirements of the applicable zoning regulations;

3. Whether the real property has a satisfactory potable water supply;

4. Whether the real property has legal access to a city-maintained or county-maintained road;

5. Whether the current owner would have been required to dedicate land for any public purpose or construct or install any improvements pursuant to the terms of the Subdivision Map Act or city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto had the subdivision by which the real property was created been submitted for approval at the time the current owner acquired the property.

D. Approval for development shall be granted for development of real property where improvements have been completed prior to the time a permit or grant of approval was required for development of the property, or for development of real property for which improvements have been completed in reliance on a previous permit or grant of approval for development, unless the city engineer finds that development is contrary to the public health or safety.

E. Whenever any person submits an application for a building permit or other permit, for proposed construction of more than one building on any single lot or building site, the building division director shall refer such application together with the plot plan to the city engineer for his determination as to whether such proposed construction would create a subdivision. The permit for such proposed construction shall not be issued unless the city engineer has approved the plot plan and determined that the proposed construction would not constitute a violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this title.

F. A request for development approval or a certificate of compliance shall be accompanied by a fee established by city council resolution. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.040 Certificates of compliance.

A. Any owner of real property or a vendee of such person pursuant to a contract of sale of such real property may request in writing that the city engineer make a determination whether such real property complies with applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto, or that such real property does not comply with the provisions, and the city engineer shall so notify the owner thereof setting forth the particulars of such compliance or noncompliance. If the subject real property is found to be in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act and city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto, the city engineer shall cause a certification of compliance relative to such real property to be filed for record with the county recorder.

If the subject real property is found not to be in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act and city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto, the city engineer may issue a notice of violation or a conditional certificate of compliance. When issuing a conditional certificate of compliance, the city engineer may impose such conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his interest in the property and which has been established at such time by the Subdivision Map Act or city ordinances enacted pursuant thereto. Upon making such a determination and establishing such conditions, the city engineer shall cause a conditional certification of compliance setting forth such conditions to be filed for record with the county recorder, fulfillment and implementation of the conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or grant of approval for development of the property, but compliance with such conditions shall not be required until such time as a building permit or granting permit is issued by the city.

B. Certificates of compliance shall be issued for real property that:

1. Has been approved for development pursuant to SBMC 16.44.030;

2. Has been approved for division, and the requirement for preparing, filing and recording a parcel map has been waived pursuant to SBMC 16.24.150.

C. A recorded final subdivision map or recorded parcel map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the lots described therein, and no additional certificates of compliance shall be issued therefor. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.050 Appeal.

Any interested person may appeal any action of the city manager or city engineer pursuant to this chapter to the city council as provided in SBMC 16.24.140. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.060 Violations.

Any person violating any of the provisions of this title is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months and a fine not exceeding $500.00, or by both such imprisonment and such fine. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.070 Severability.

If any provisions of this title or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application thereof, and to this end the provisions of this title are severable. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.080 Conflict – Approved maps.

The provisions of the Subdivision Map Act as defined in this title and any amendments thereto, and this title shall not apply to any tentative map which has been approved pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act and local ordinance as in effect on July 1, 1986. Such maps shall be processed under the law which applied to them at the time of such approval, provided the subdivider completes the subdivision process within the period of the initial approval of the map. Any map for which an extension is granted shall comply with the provisions of this title. (Ord. 101 Exh. A, 1989)


16.44.090 Presumption of lawful creation.

A. For purposes of this title, any parcel created prior to July 1, 1986, shall be conclusively presumed to have been lawfully created if the parcel resulted from a division of land in which fewer than five parcels were created and if, at the time of the creation of the parcel, there was no local ordinance in effect which regulated divisions of land creating fewer than five parcels.

B. For purposes of this title, any parcel created prior to July 1, 1986, shall be conclusively presumed to have been lawfully created if any subsequent purchaser acquired that parcel for valuable consideration without actual or constructive knowledge of a violation of this division or other local ordinance. Owners of parcels or units of land affected by the provisions of this subdivision shall be required to obtain a certificate of compliance or a conditional certificate of compliance pursuant to this chapter prior to obtaining a permit or other grant of approval for development of the parcel or unit of land. For purposes of determining whether the parcel or unit of land complies with the provision so this title or the Subdivision Map Act, as required by SBMC 16.44.040, the presumption declared in this subsection shall not be operative.

17.04.010 Title.

This title is known as the “City of Solana Beach Zoning Ordinance”, hereafter referred to as the zoning ordinance. This title is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the city of Solana Beach by Section 65800 et seq. of the Government Code of the state of California. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.04.020 Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this title is to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality of the city of Solana Beach by providing regulations to ensure an appropriate mix of land uses in an orderly manner. More specifically, these standards are intended to:

A. Implement the goals and objectives of the general plan and to guide and manage the future growth of the city in accordance with such plan;

B. Adoption of Zoning District Map.

1. The boundaries of the land use zones established by this section shall be shown upon the map designated as the “City of Solana Beach Official Zoning Map,” on file with the city clerk, and available at the department of community development. The zoning map, together with all legends, symbols, notations, references, zoning boundaries and other information thereon, shall be a part of the ordinance codified in this title and is adopted concurrently herewith. This map shall be consistent with the adopted general plan land use map.

2. The zoning map and a record of all prior amendments thereto shall be kept on file with the city clerk, and shall constitute the original record. A copy of the currently effective zoning map shall also be kept on file with the department of community development. Changes to the boundaries of any zone shall follow the process outlined in Chapter 17.76 SBMC (Amendments) and shall be reflected on the zoning map.

C. Applicability.

1. The provisions of this title hereby are declared to be in effect upon all properties included within the boundaries of each and every zone established by this title.

2. Any structure or project which was approved or conditionally approved under the provisions of earlier ordinances of the city, but which is in conflict with the provisions of this title, may be constructed in strict accordance with all of the provisions and conditions of the prior approval; and provided, that the applicant complies with all requirements of the approval or conditional approval and has vested the right to proceed by obtaining a building permit and making substantial expenditures in good faith reliance thereon.

3. Distances between structures, or between a structure and any property line, setback line, or other line or location prescribed by this title shall be measured to the exterior face of the nearest wall or vertical support of such structure.

D. Rules Applying to Zoning Boundary Lines. The following rules shall apply in determining the boundaries and applicability of regulations for any zone shown on the zoning map:

1. Wherever a lot or site is divided by a boundary between zones, the regulations applicable within each zone shall be applied separately to each portion of the site in the respective districts. Boundary lines shall be treated as side or rear property lines and setbacks shall be required as appropriate. Residential densities or floor area ratios shall not be averaged across zoning boundaries.

2. Where a zone boundary follows a public street or alley, the centerline of the street shall be the boundary. Where a boundary follows a lot line, the lot line shall be the boundary.

3. Where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of the zone boundary, unless indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map.

4. A symbol, or symbols, indicating the classification of property on the zoning map shall in each instance apply to the whole of the area within the zone boundaries.

5. Where any public right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, the land use zone regulations applied to abutting property shall thereafter extend to the centerline of such vacated or abandoned right-of-way.

6. In case any uncertainty exists, the director of community development shall determine the location of the zone boundary. (Ord. 357 § 1, 2007; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.04.050 Conflicts and clarifications.

A. Conflict with Other Regulations. Whenever the provisions of this title impose more restrictive regulations upon buildings or structures, or on the use of lands, or require larger open space, yards, or setbacks, or otherwise establish more restrictive regulations than are imposed or required by any other law, title, ordinance, code or regulation, the provisions of this title shall govern.

B. Statutory Authority in Case of Conflicting Provisions. Nothing in this code shall be deemed to affect, annul or abrogate any other ordinances pertaining or applicable to the properties and areas affected by this title. In the event that a conflict does arise, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.

C. Clarification of Ambiguity. If ambiguity arises concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use within the meaning and intent of this title, or if ambiguity exists with respect to matters of height, yard requirements, area requirements, or zone boundaries as set forth herein, it shall be the duty of the planning director to ascertain all pertinent facts and by resolution of record set forth the findings and interpretations.

D. Existing Easements, Covenants, or Agreements. The provisions of this title are not intended to interfere with or void any easements, covenants, or other existing agreements which are more restrictive than the provisions contained in this title. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.04.060 Existing lots which do not meet minimum dimension or area requirements.

Any lot, parcel, or building site shall be conclusively deemed to meet the minimum dimension or area requirements of the zone in which it is located if:

A. It existed as a legal lot, parcel or building site on December 18, 1989;

B. It has not been used in combination with another lot as a single building site;

C. It did not result from a division of land in violation of state law or city ordinance;

D. It has not been merged with another lot under the provision of SBMC Title 16 (Subdivisions), or any previous zoning ordinance. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.04.070 Severability.

If any chapter, section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this title is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this title. The council hereby declares that it would have adopted each chapter, section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more portions of this code might be declared invalid, and if for any reason portions of this title should be declared invalid, then all other portions of the title shall remain in full force and effect.

17.12.030 Use determination.

A. When a use is not specifically listed in Table 17.12.020-A (Use Regulations Matrix), it shall be understood that the use may be permitted, permitted with limitations, conditionally permitted, or prohibited if it is determined by the director that the use is similar to other uses listed.

B. It is further recognized that every conceivable use cannot be identified in this title, and anticipating that new uses will evolve over time, this section establishes the director’s authority to compare a proposed use and measure it against those uses listed in Table 17.12.020-A (Use Regulations Matrix), SBMC 17.12.010 (Use Classifications and Definitions) and the Standard Industrial Classification Manual for determining similarity.

C. In determining “similarity” the director shall make all of the following findings:

1. The proposed use shall meet the intent of, and be consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the general plan;

2. The proposed use shall meet the stated purpose and general intent of the zone in which the use is proposed to be located;

3. The proposed use shall not adversely impact the public health, safety and general welfare of the city’s residents; and

4. The proposed use shall have characteristics in common with, and not be of greater intensity, density or generate more environmental impact, than those uses listed in the zone in which it is to be located. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)

17.16.010 Purpose and intent.

A. This chapter is enacted to accomplish the regulation and eventual elimination of all nonconforming uses, except nonconforming residential uses, and the regulation of nonconforming structures. It is not intended to allow the expansion or any increase in intensity of use for legal nonconforming structures on residential lots beyond what is allowed by applicable zoning regulations. Nothing in this chapter shall supersede State Coastal Act legislation.

B. This chapter is not intended to restrict the city’s ability to eliminate a public nuisance.

C. This chapter is not intended to limit the city’s ability to condemn a use or structure and pay to the owner thereof reasonable compensation.

D. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from declaring that a building, structure, improvement or use constitutes a danger to the safety, health or welfare of the public and from taking lawful action to remedy that danger.

E. This chapter does not preclude the city from requiring an owner of a structure which has been constructed, expanded or altered either without a required building permit or contrary to the provision of an issued building permit, either to modify or remove such structure or to obtain all required building inspections and associated approvals. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.020 Definitions.

This section provides definitions of words, terms, or phrases which apply specifically to this chapter. It is also intended that the definitions in Chapter 17.08 SBMC shall be used except where there may be a conflict with the definitions set forth in this section. Where such a conflict exists the definitions set forth in this section shall take precedence.

A. A “nonconforming use” is a use that:

1. Is not within the scope, either expressly or implicitly, of the zoning restrictions set forth in this title which describe the purpose, intent, permissible uses, density, accessory uses and prohibited uses for the zone in which the particular use is located;

2. Did comply with the zoning restrictions contained in this title in effect at the time the use was created and was lawfully created;

3. Has not been terminated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;

4. For purposes of this section, uses for which the zoning matrix (SBMC 17.12.020) requires a use permit or allows with limitation, shall not be considered a nonconforming use. Expansions and/or intensification of said uses shall, however, require a use permit;

5. Note that nonconforming uses for which a permit was required and no permit has been issued are classed as “illegal” and all such uses, including accessory apartments, are subject to the provisions of SBMC 17.72.120.

B. A “nonconforming structure” is a building, structure or improvement that:

1. Does not conform to the development standards described in this title, together with all building standards including, without limitation, height, setbacks, density, parking, type of building, or coverage of lot by structure; and

2. Did comply with the development standards contained in this title in effect at the time the building, structure or improvement was constructed or structurally altered and was lawfully constructed.

C. A “nonconformity” is a nonconforming use or a nonconforming structure.

D. A “principal building or structure” is a building in which a principal use is located. It does not include detached accessory buildings or structures such as garages and sheds, or additions to the principal structure which, if removed, would not affect the structural integrity of the principal building.

E. “Refurbishment” means to replace or improve existing building finishes, nonstructural surfaces or fenestration for the purpose of maintenance or aesthetic improvement of the building. Refurbishment does not include the replacement of structural components.

F. Structure. Where the term “structure” is used for residential lots, it shall be used to include buildings, retaining walls and all built structures on the residential lot with the exception of fences. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 209 § 2, 1995; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.030 Establishment of nonconformity.

In order to legally continue a use, structural aspect of a building, structure or improvement that is not consistent with the regulations of this title, the person claiming a legal nonconforming use or structural nonconformity has the burden of proof to establish that the use or structural feature qualifies in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow an increase in the intensity of use, where the intensity of the use on the lot is nonconforming. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.040 Maintenance.

Routine internal and external maintenance and repairs may be performed on a nonconforming structure. Additionally, any maintenance or repairs required by governmental agencies for health, safety, and welfare purposes shall be allowed. Refurbishment may be performed on a nonconforming principal residential building and accessory structures related to a principal residential structure located anywhere on a residential lot. Refurbishment may not expand the existing building envelope or expand the usable floor area if the expansion increases the nonconformity of the principal residential structure or accessory structure. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.050 Alterations and additions on lots with nonconforming uses.

Where a nonconforming use exists on a lot, additional uses, structures or structural internal and external additions may be established on the lot; provided such additional uses, structures, or structural additions do not increase the size, degree, or intensity of the existing nonconformity. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.060 Additions to nonconforming structures.

Where a nonconforming structure exists on a lot (including an accessory structure on a residential lot), additional uses, structures, or structural internal and external additions may be established on the lot; provided such additional uses, structures, or structural additions do not increase the size or degree of the existing nonconformity. This section shall not be interpreted to allow the reconstruction of a nonconforming structure. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 209 § 1, 1995; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.070 Change of use – Abandonment of nonconforming use.

A. A nonconforming use of a structure or site shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.

B. Whenever a nonconforming use has been abandoned, discontinued or changed to a conforming use for a continuous period of 180 days, the nonconforming use shall not be re-established, and the use of the structure or site thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations for the zone in which it is located. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.080 Restoration of damaged nonconforming structures and uses.

A. Residential Structures (Principal Structures). Any nonconforming principal residential structure which is partially damaged or totally destroyed by fire or other calamity may be restored (rebuilt) to the pre-existing building envelope and any pre-existing nonconforming use may be resumed; provided, that restoration is started within three years and diligently pursued to completion, with completion to be accomplished within 18 months from the issuance of the required permit. Restoration includes, but is not limited to: re-establishment of the principal building footprint, density (number of units), floor area, front, side, and rear yards, setbacks, building height, distance between structures, and numbers of parking spaces actually in existence on the site at the time the damage or destruction occurred.

1. Geology Report Required for Properties on Coastal Bluffs. Where such property is located on a coastal bluff and the extent of damage to the principal residential structure exceeds 75 percent of the floor area and/or 75 percent of its full replacement value, the city council shall find that any intrusion into the coastal bluff setback otherwise required by SBMC 17.20.030(B) is supported by a geologic report showing that the reconstruction will not adversely affect bluff stability for 70 years.

B. Nonresidential Structures (Principal Structures).

1. Destruction to the Extent of 50 Percent or Less. Any nonconforming principal nonresidential structure which is partially destroyed by fire or other calamity to the extent of 50 percent or less of the floor area and/or 50 percent or less of the full replacement value of the structure may be restored (rebuilt) to the pre-existing building envelope and any pre-existing nonconforming use may be resumed; provided, that restoration is started within one year and diligently pursued to completion, with completion to be accomplished within 18 months from the issuance of the required permit. Restoration includes, but is not limited to: re-establishment of the principal building footprint, floor area, front, side, and rear yards, setbacks, building height, distance between structures, and numbers of parking spaces actually in existence on the site at the time the damage or destruction occurred.

2. Destruction to an Extent Greater Than 50 Percent. Any nonconforming principal nonresidential structure which is destroyed by fire or other calamity to an extent greater than 50 percent of the floor area and/or greater than 50 percent of the full replacement value of the structure shall not be restored (rebuilt) unless it is in full conformance with the regulations of this title. However, any pre-existing nonconforming uses may be resumed in the rebuilt conforming structure.

C. Restoration of Accessory Structures. Whenever a nonconforming accessory structure (see definition SBMC 17.16.020(D)) is destroyed by fire or other calamity to the extent of 50 percent or more of the full replacement value of such accessory structure, then that structure may not be restored unless it is in full conformance with the regulations of this title, except accessory structures on residential lots may be restored to their pre-existing building envelope.

D. Time Extensions for Restoring Nonconforming Structures and Uses. Time extensions may be granted by the director with the applicant having appeal rights to the city council if the applicant demonstrates they have practiced due diligence and that delays are due to such factors as other permitting agencies including but not limited to: the city, the Coastal Commission, the county, and the state of California. Requests for time extensions must be in writing and received prior to the expiration of the time period for reconstruction. The community development director or the city council may approve an extension request even when the application for an extension is filed after the expiration of the time period for reconstruction when a finding of a good cause can be made. 

Note that illegal structures are subject to the provisions of SBMC 17.72.120. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.090 Termination of nonconforming uses.

All nonconforming uses, except uses which do not conform to density, shall be terminated and removed from their sites in accordance with the following schedule. The termination period shall be based on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title.

Table 17.16.090 – A Termination Schedule for Nonconforming Uses 

	Type of Nonconforming Use	Termination Period

	1.	Use which does not occupy a structure	Three years (from effective date of ordinance codified in this chapter)*

	2.	Use which occupies a structure	Seven years (from effective date of ordinance codified in this chapter)*

	*Termination period may be extended by conditional use permit, see SBMC 17.16.120, Expansion, restoration, and extension of nonconforming uses and structures by conditional use permit. 

(Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.100 Time when use becomes nonconforming.

Whenever a use becomes nonconforming because of a change of zoning boundaries or a change of regulations for the zone in which the site is located, the period of time prescribed in this chapter for the termination of the use shall be computed from the effective date of the change of zone or regulations. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.110 Additional requirements for specific nonconformities.

In addition to the general requirements for all nonconforming uses and structures, the following requirements shall apply to the specific nonconformities detailed below:

A. Nonconforming Walls and Fences. Any nonconforming wall or fence shall be allowed to remain in perpetuity; provided, the size or degree of the nonconformity is not increased.

B. Nonconforming Outdoor Storage. Outdoor storage areas which do not meet the minimum requirements as provided in SBMC 17.60.080, Outdoor storage, sales, and service yards, shall be brought into conformity within three years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title.

C. Nonconforming Parking. For all nonresidential uses on premises which do not meet the minimum parking requirements as provided in Chapter 17.52 SBMC, the following requirements shall apply:

1. Any change of use which requires more parking than the previous use shall be allowed only if the full amount of the required parking for the new use is provided. Parking deficiencies associated with other existing uses may be maintained. A change of use which does not require more parking than the previous use shall be allowed and the existing deficiency may be maintained.

2. New structures or structural additions which result in an expansion of less than 50 percent of the existing floor area of the lot shall be allowed only if the required parking for the expansion area is provided. Parking deficiencies for the existing floor area may be maintained.

3. New structures or structural additions which result in an expansion of 50 percent or more of the existing floor area of the lot shall be allowed only if the required parking for the expansion area is provided and all parking deficiencies for the existing floor area are eliminated.

Note that properties with illegal development are regulated by SBMC 17.72.120.

D. Existing Residential Uses and Structures in Commercial Zones. Legally existing residential uses and structures in the commercial zone shall not be subject to the termination schedule in SBMC 17.16.090, Termination of nonconforming uses, and are allowed to continue consistent with the requirements in this chapter.

Furthermore, new commercial structures and uses or mixed commercial/residential structures and uses may be established on parcels zoned commercial which contain existing residential uses, consistent with all applicable zoning standards for development on a commercial zoned property. However, SBMC 17.24.020(B) requiring that mixed-use development be integrated into a single structure shall not be applicable for the existing residential uses or structures.

E. Replacement, repair or reinforcement of existing structural components within the existing building envelope of principal residential structures and related accessory structures is allowed as necessary to repair damage from fire, earthquake, flood, weather, sunlight, mold, mildew, termites, accidental or natural causes. Further, reinforcement, augmentation or strengthening of existing structural components within the existing building envelope of these structures when necessary to support fire safety or building safety code improvements shall be allowed. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.120 Expansion, restoration, and extension of nonconforming uses by conditional use permit.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a request for the expansion, restoration, or time extension of a nonconforming use may be granted subject to a conditional use permit. The city council may grant the request, grant the request with modification, or deny the request. The city council may require as a condition of a use permit that a specific termination date be set for the use which is being expanded, restored, or extended. Before granting a conditional use permit for the expansion, restoration, or time extension of a nonconforming use, the city council shall make the following findings:

A. That the strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulations within this chapter would:

1. Result in unreasonable practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; or

2. Result in the demolition or significant alteration of a designated historic/cultural landmark, or any other structure, which is important to the character of the street.

B. That the granting of the permit will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity. (Ord. 372, 2008; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.16.130 Severability.

The provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable and if any provision, sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter is held illegal, invalid, unconstitutional or inapplicable to any person or circumstances, such illegality, invalidity or unconstitutionality or inapplicability shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections, or parts of this chapter or their application to persons and circumstances. (Ord. 372, 2008)

17.20.010 Purpose and intent.

The residential zones are intended to implement the goals and objectives for single-family and multifamily residential development as established in the Solana Beach general plan. The individual zones which are required to implement the land use designations in the Solana Beach general plan are described as follows:

A. Estate Residential Zone (ER-1), (ER-2) – (zero to two dwelling units/net acre): These zones are intended for residential development in areas characterized by single-family homes on semirural estate lots of one-half acre or larger. The estate sized parcels help preserve the natural terrain and minimize grading requirements.

B. Low Residential Zone (LR) – (three dwelling units/net acre): This zone is intended for residential development in areas characterized by detached single-family homes on older subdivided lots. Within the scaled residential overlay zone (SROZ), development in the LR zone shall also be subject to the SROZ superseding development regulations (SBMC 17.48.040).

C. Low Medium Residential Zone (LMR) – (four dwelling units/net acre): This zone is intended for residential development in areas characterized primarily by detached single-family homes on both older and newer subdivided lots. Within the SROZ, development in the LMR zone shall also be subject to the SROZ superseding development regulations (SBMC 17.48.040).

D. Medium Residential Zone (MR) – (five to seven dwelling units/net acre): This zone is intended to provide for residential development in areas characterized primarily by detached single-family dwellings on older subdivided lots and two-family and multiple-family dwellings within newer, large lot, planned developments. Within the SROZ, development in the MR zone shall also be subject to the SROZ superseding development regulations (SBMC 17.48.040).

E. Medium High Residential Zone (MHR) – (eight to 12 dwelling units/net acre): This zone is intended for a wide range of residential development types including detached single-family and attached duplex units at the low end of the density range and multiple-family attached units at the higher end of the density range.

F. High Residential Zone (HR) – (13 to 20 dwelling units/net acre): This zone is intended for multiple-family attached units such as apartments and condominium buildings. Such areas are located in close proximity to major community facilities, commercial centers and transportation routes. It is intended that development in this zone utilize innovative site planning, and provide on-site recreational amenities. (Ord. 357 § 3, 2007; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.20.020 Permitted uses and structures.

A. Principal and Conditional Uses. The uses permitted in the residential zones shall be as indicated in SBMC 17.12.020 (Use Regulations Matrix) Table 17.12.020-A. Permitted, conditional, and prohibited uses are indicated as follows:

	“P”	indicates that the use shall be a permitted use in the zone.

	“PL”	indicates that the use shall be permitted subject to the limitations set forth in subsection B of this section.

	“C”	indicates that the use is subject to a conditional use permit issued by the director of community development in accordance with SBMC 17.68.010 (Conditional Use Permits).

	“CC”	indicates that the use is subject to a conditional use permit issued by the city council in accordance with SBMC 17.68.010 (Conditional Use Permits).

	“E”	indicates that the use shall be prohibited within the zone.

In the event a use is not specifically listed in Table 17.12.020-A, the director of community development shall have the authority to categorize such use in accordance with the procedure outlined in SBMC 17.12.030 (Use Determination).

	(MHR)	8 du/net acre	12 du/net acrec

	(HR)	13 du/net acre	20 du/net acrec

a. The permitted density in the situation where the minimum range cannot be met shall be the first whole number above the minimum of the range. In no instance, however, shall it exceed the maximum number permitted by the general plan and these zoning regulations (See Council Policy #7).

b. In the (ER-1), (ER-2), (LR), and (LMR) zones, no lot shall be occupied by more than one principal dwelling unit.

c. Densities exceeding the base density in excess of those permitted by subsection (a) of this table are allowable, up to the maximum density specified; provided the development is approved pursuant to a development review permit. The maximum density shall not be construed to be a “guaranteed right” and shall be granted only upon demonstration that the proposed development incorporates exemplary site planning and design and complies with all applicable zoning regulations and general plan objectives. Whenever the proposed density for a site is greater than that permitted by subsection (a) of this table, the increased density shall be justified by consideration of such matters as: superior project design; public facility availability; availability of public transportation; proximity to public recreation; proximity to public facilities or community amenities provided by the developer of the site; whether the increased density will assist the city in meeting its regional housing obligations and local housing goals; whether the increased density will adversely affect the neighborhood; or whether the increased density will assist the city in meeting other general plan goals and objectives.

2. The maximum number of units per lot or site shall be equal to the product of the total net area of the lot or site (expressed in acres) multiplied by the applicable density (Units = Lot Size in Acres x Dwelling Unit Density). A fractional density of 0.70 or more may be rounded up to the nearest whole number of dwelling units; provided the project incorporates superior design and site planning as set forth in subsection (B)(1) of this section. A fractional density of less than 0.70 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of dwelling units.

3. The net area of the site shall consist of those portions of the site exclusive of public rights-of-way for streets, railroad rights-of-way, utility easements for high voltage electrical transmission lines and undevelopable slopes, bluffs and sensitive lands as set forth in subsection (B)(4) of this section.

4. For subdivisions and multiple dwelling unit projects located in or in proximity to sensitive lands such as steep slopes, coastal bluffs and wetlands, the density otherwise established for the site shall be adjusted as follows:

 

Table 17.20.030-C Density Adjustments for Sensitive Lands 

	Area Type	Density Adjustment Multiplier

	Wetland Areas	0.00

	Slopes less than 25% grade	1.00

	Slopes 25% to 40% grade and not	 

	also in another sensitive area*	0.50

	Slopes greater than 40% grade	0.00

	Slopes of 25% or greater grade:	 

	 1) Along coastal bluffs	0.00

	 2) Uplands adjoining San Elijo Lagoon	0.00

*Minimal development encroachment into 25 percent slopes is allowable pursuant to SBMC 17.48.020 (Hillside Overlay Zone).

5. State-mandated density bonus provisions shall be applicable to all projects, including projects of less than five units as prescribed in SBMC 17.20.050 (Density Bonus).

C. Minimum Floor Area. Each dwelling unit shall have a minimum gross floor area of 650 square feet.

	B	25'	10'	10'	40'

	C	25'	10'	10'	25'

	D	25'	5'	10'	25'

a. Pursuant to a development review permit, front yards for lots in the (MR) zone along the west side of Pacific Avenue may be reduced to 10 feet to compensate for required coastal bluff rear yard setbacks. Second stories shall be set back 15 feet from the street right-of-way. Garages shall be allowed within front yards; provided a five-foot minimum setback is maintained between the garage and the street right-of-way. Incremental variations in the first and second floor setbacks, not to exceed five feet, may be allowed; provided the average setback is maintained and no portion of the building is located within five feet of the right-of-way.

b. Where any lot has a depth of less than 100 feet or fronts on a public right-of-way 55 feet or greater in width, the minimum required front yard shall be reduced to 20 feet.

c. Pursuant to a development review permit, zero lot line units (attached or detached) having only one side yard may be permitted in the (LR), (LMR), and (MR) zones; provided:

3. In the (MR), (MHR) and (HR) zones, a minimum separation of 15 feet shall be required between all principal structures on the same lot, except when said structures are single-family detached units, in which instance the separation between structures may be no less than 10 feet.

4. Architectural features, such as eaves, awnings, canopies, bay windows and balconies may project into required yards a maximum distance of two feet; provided such appendages are supported only at, or behind, the building setback line.

5. Fireplace chimneys, fire escapes, exterior stairs and landings, and similar architectural features requiring ground contact may project into required yards a maximum distance of two feet; provided such feature shall be three feet from a property line.

E. Coastal and Inland Bluff Setbacks.

1. Coastal and Inland Bluffs.

a. Except as provided in subsection (E)(3) of this section, structures shall be set back a minimum of 40 feet from the top edge of any coastal bluff, or 15 feet from the top edge of any inland bluff (both natural or artificial); provided, however, dwelling structures may be built to within 25 feet of the top edge of a coastal bluff, based upon an engineering geology report prepared by a duly licensed engineering professional showing that: (1) the site is stable enough to support the development with the proposed bluff edge setback; and (2) that the development can be designed so that it will neither be subject to nor contribute to significant bluff instability for 70 years. All engineering geology reports must be prepared by a geologist selected by the applicant from the list of city qualified geologists on file with the planning department. An independent analysis of all geotechnical reports submitted pursuant to this subsection and subsection (E)(1)(b) of this section shall be prepared by a geologic consultant hired by the city, the cost of which shall be paid for by the applicant.

b. All development along a coastal bluff shall require an engineering geology report to be submitted in conjunction with the application.

c. All development along any inland bluffs shall require a soils report to be submitted in conjunction with the application. Where unstable conditions are indicated, but in the opinion of the city engineer are not sufficiently defined in the soils report, a preliminary engineering geology report shall also be required. The preliminary engineering geology report shall include the results of subsurface investigations sufficient to identify the nature and magnitude of such unstable conditions, and shall identify alternative mitigation measures that may be needed, including increased setbacks from the inland bluff edge.

2. Canyon Rim Above San Elijo Lagoon. Except as provided in subsection (E)(3) of this section, structures shall be set back 25 feet from the rim of the canyons adjoining San Elijo Lagoon, west of I-5. The city council may further modify these setback requirements through the review procedures established within the scenic area overlay zone, SBMC 17.48.010, as such overlay zone may be applicable.

3. Accessory Encroachments. For the purposes of determining bluff and canyon rim setbacks, swimming pools, spas, fences or walls in excess of 42 inches in height, decks with a floor height of more than 30 inches at the grade elevation, and similar accessory structures shall be considered structures. Encroachments of decks with a floor elevation of 30 inches or less or fences 42 inches or less in height may be permitted, but no closer than 15 feet from the top edge of the coastal bluff or five feet from the top edge of any inland bluff or canyon rim, except as follows. Fences of 42 inches or less in height, and constructed of durable lightweight materials such as chain link, wood, or wrought iron fencing with wood or pipe fence posts, but not concrete block, brick or concrete pillar construction, and built without the use of mechanized equipment may be constructed to within five feet of the top edge of a coastal bluff, or to the edge of an inland bluff or canyon rim; provided such fence does not impact bluff stability.

G. Maximum Building Height.

1. The maximum building height for the (ER-1), (ER-2), (LR), (LMR), (MR), (MHR) and (HR) residential zones shall be 25 feet subject to the daylight plane height limitation described in subsection H of this section.

2. Pursuant to a development review permit the maximum building height for the (MHR) and (HR) residential zones may be increased to 30 feet.

3. Pursuant to a conditional use permit, the city council may allow limited height increases to a maximum of 35 feet for civic uses in the (MHR) and (HR) residential zones when the proposed height increase is a necessary and/or required function of the specific civic use proposal.

4. For those areas where an additional setback is required for the second floor, no portion of the first story, including basements, shall exceed a height of 16 feet above the pre-existing or finished grade, whichever is lower.

H. Daylight Plane Height. Within the (ER-1), (ER-2), (LR), (LMR), (MR), (MHR) and (HR) zones all new structures and structural additions shall be encouraged, but not required, to be designed to use a daylight plane beginning at a vertical height of 16 feet above any two designated setback lines and sloping toward the interior of the lot at a 30 degree angle (from horizontal) until the 25-foot height limit is reached. Applicable setback lines shall include any of the following combinations:


[IMAGE]


Architectural features, such as dormers or gables, may extend outside the building envelope into the daylight plane; provided, that the feature or combination of features measures no more than 15 feet in length at the point of intersection with the daylight plane. The 15-foot intrusion shall be allowed separately to the front, rear, and each side yard daylight planes. The daylight plane concept may be modified if necessary to minimize disturbance of sensitive lands, to avoid excessive grading and/or on unusually shaped lots without standard buildable areas. 

I. Scaled Residential Overlay Zone. Development in the LR, LMR, and MR zones, within the scaled residential overlay zone (SROZ), shall also be subject to the SROZ superseding development regulations (SBMC 17.48.040).

C. Repealed by Ord. 470.

D. Accessory Dwelling Units. The purpose of this subsection is to provide regulations for the establishment of accessory dwelling units in residential zones and to define an approval process for such accessory dwelling units. The intent of this subsection is to provide opportunities for more affordable housing in areas where adequate public facilities and services are available, and impacts upon the residential neighborhoods directly affected would be minimized. It is the goal of the council that accessory dwelling units be equitably distributed throughout the city. The city council will review this subsection as necessary to determine that this goal is being carried out. If it is found that the development of accessory dwelling units is being unduly concentrated and resulting in deleterious impacts, the council may review this subsection and revise it as needed.

1. For purposes of this chapter, “accessory dwelling unit” shall have the meaning defined in Section 65852.2 of the California Government Code.

2. Accessory dwelling units are residential uses consistent with the uses permitted in (ER-1), (ER-2), (LR), (LMR), (MR), (MHR), and (HR) zones.

A density bonus request will be subject to the following provisions:

1. Base Density Bonus. For the purpose of this section, “density bonus” shall mean a density increase of twenty percent (20%), for senior citizen housing developments and for qualifying housing developments that have the requisite percentage of housing reserved for lower income households or very low income households, unless a lesser density bonus percentage is elected by the applicant, over the maximum residential density as determined by Table 17.20.030B. “Density bonus” also means a density increase of five percent (5%) for qualifying housing developments that have the requisite percentage of housing for moderate income households.

When calculating the required number of target units, any resulting decimal shall be rounded to the next larger integer.

2. Additional Density Bonus. If an applicant exceeds the percentages set forth in subsection C of this section the applicant shall be entitled to an additional density bonus above 20 percent calculated as follows:

a. For each one percent (1%) increase above ten percent (10%) in the percentage of units affordable to lower income households, the density bonus shall be increased by one and one-half percent (1.5%), up to a maximum of thirty-five percent (35%) for the total project;

b. For each one percent (1%) increase above five percent (5%) in the percentage of units affordable to very low income households, the density bonus shall be increased by two and one-half percent (2.5%), up to a maximum of thirty-five percent (35%) for the total project;

E. The procedures for implementing this section are as follows:

1. The density bonus provision shall not apply to senior citizen and senior congregate care housing projects that utilize alternative density bonus provisions contained in this title.

2. All residential developments are subject to and must satisfy the city’s inclusionary housing requirements (Chapter 17.70 SBMC), notwithstanding a developer’s request to process a residential development under other program requirements, laws or regulations.

Units reserved for very low income and/or lower income households to meet density bonus requirements may be used toward meeting inclusionary housing requirements.

3. Prior to the issuance of a building permit or approval of any final or parcel map for any dwelling unit in a development for which density bonus units have been awarded, or additional incentive(s), waivers, or parking reductions have been received, the developer shall submit documentation which identifies the target units and shall enter into a written agreement with the city to guarantee for 30 years their continued use and availability to very low income and lower income households or qualified residents as provided in Government Code Section 65915, or to guarantee for 45 years their continued use and availability to moderate income households. The agreement shall extend more than 30 or 45 years, as applicable, if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program. The terms and conditions of the agreement shall run with the land which is to be developed, shall be binding upon the successor in interest of the developer, and shall be recorded in the office of the San Diego County recorder.

c. The city shall have the authority to enter into other agreements with the developer or purchasers of the dwelling units or other agencies, as may be necessary to assure that the target units are continuously occupied by eligible households.

4. Target units shall be generally dispersed throughout a housing development and shall not differ in appearance from other units in the housing development.

F. Additional Incentive(s).

1. The city shall provide additional incentive(s), for qualified housing developments upon the written request of the developer, as permitted by subsection D of this section, unless the city makes a written finding that:

a. The additional incentive(s) is not required to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rent for the very low and lower income units to be set as defined by Section 50053 of the Health and Safety Code; or

b. The additional incentive(s) would have a specific adverse impact on public health and safety or the physical environment, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), or on any property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and there is no feasible way to mitigate the adverse impact without making the housing development unaffordable to low and moderate income households; or

c. The additional incentive(s) would be contrary to state or federal law.

2. The additional incentive(s) may include, but is not limited to:

a. A reduction or modification of zoning ordinance requirements which exceed the minimum building standards approved by the State Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 123 of the Health and Safety Code including, but not limited to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be required, that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

b. Approval of mixed use development in conjunction with the housing development if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the development and if the project will be compatible internally as well as with the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing project will be located.

c. Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the city which result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

3. The city may offer an equivalent financial incentive in lieu of granting a density bonus and an additional incentive(s). However, nothing in this section requires the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development by the city, including the provision of publicly owned land or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements.

4. Justification for Additional Incentive(s). An applicant requesting additional incentive(s) shall also show that the requested incentive(s) is required to provide for affordable housing costs by submitting a development pro forma with the capital costs, operating expenses, return on investment, profit/loss, loan-to-value ratio and the debt coverage ratio including the contribution(s) provided by any applicable subsidy program(s), and the economic effect created by the price, rent, and income restrictions on the affordable housing units. Documentation to support underlying assumptions shall be submitted by the applicant. The applicant is required to submit any additional documentation, as requested, to ascertain reasonable basis for assumptions.

 G. Waivers.

1. The city shall approve requests for waivers of development standards if those development standards would physically preclude the construction of a housing development with the density bonus and additional incentive(s) permitted by subsection D of this section, unless the city makes a written finding that:

a. The development standard would not physically preclude the construction of a housing development with the density bonus and additional incentive(s) permitted by this section; or

b. The waiver would have a specific adverse impact on public health and safety or the physical environment, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), and there is no feasible way to mitigate or avoid the adverse impact; or

c. The waiver would have an adverse impact on any property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources; or

d. The waiver would be contrary to state or federal law. (Ord. 392 § 1, 2009; Ord. 285 § 1, 2002; Ord. 261 § 1, 2000; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)

The commercial and industrial zones are intended to implement the goals and objectives, for general commercial, light commercial, professional office, and light industrial development as established in the Solana Beach general plan. Please note that the Highway 101 specific plan establishes overriding standards that should be used in addition to this chapter. The individual zones which are required to implement the land use designations in the Solana Beach general plan are described as follows:

A. General Commercial Zone (C): This zone is intended to provide for commercial activities and services of a more intensive nature. These uses would be located primarily along major transportation routes and would include major shopping facilities and service centers. In addition, the general commercial zone is intended to accommodate and promote tourist-oriented commercial uses along Highway 101.

B. Light Commercial Zone (LC): This zone is intended to provide for areas of lower intensity commercial activities and services which have minimal impact on nearby residential neighborhoods. Where feasible, such uses should provide for convenience shopping and services for residents of the immediate neighborhood.

C. Office Professional Zone (OP): This zone is intended to provide for professional office and service centers and retail accessory uses which are complementary to office development. Primary uses would include medical and dental centers, financial services and other office-based business services.

D. Light Industrial Zone (LI): This zone is intended to provide for light industrial uses such as manufacturing, assembly, research and development, warehousing, personal storage, and similar types of industrial uses which do not involve the use of environmentally hazardous materials or processes and would not result in objectionable external effects. The light industrial zone allows limited office and commercial uses which are an integral component of the on-site industrial use. Business services and personal and household services uses are allowed to a limited degree as well as very limited retail components of industrial uses. (Ord. 189 § 1, 1994; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)

Chapter 17.48 OVERLAY/SPECIAL PURPOSE ZONES

Sections:

17.48.010    Scenic area overlay zone.

17.48.020    Hillside overlay zone.

17.48.030    Floodplain overlay zone.

17.48.040    Scaled residential overlay zone.


17.48.010 Scenic area overlay zone.

A. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to regulate development in areas of high scenic value to preserve and enhance the scenic resources present within and adjacent to such areas and to assure the exclusion of incompatible uses and structures. It is further recognized that the preservation and enhancement of scenic resources within the city of Solana Beach provides important social, recreation, and economic benefits for both residents and visitors alike.

B. Applicability of the Scenic Area Overlay Zone. The requirements of this section shall apply to all areas designated as scenic area overlay zone (SAOZ) on the city of Solana Beach zoning map. Such zoning shall consist of all areas of unique scenic value including, but not limited to, state scenic highways, scenic highway corridors designated by the Solana Beach general plan, critical viewshed and prime viewshed areas as designated on the local coastal program land use plan, and areas within 100 feet of significant recreational, historic or scenic resources including designated city, county, or state parks. For the purposes of these regulations all areas within the scenic area overlay zone shall be known as “designated areas”.

C. Development Review Permit Required. No building or grading permit shall be issued for any development in areas subject to the scenic area overlay zone until a development review permit has been submitted and approved in accordance with SBMC 17.68.040 (Development Review Permits) and this section.

D. Exemptions. The following are exempt from the requirements of the scenic area overlay zone:

1. Minor additions to existing structures which do not increase the existing building envelope or floor area by more than 10 percent or require more than 50 cubic yards of grading.

2. Detached accessory structures which do not exceed 10 percent of the total floor area of the principal structure or require more than 50 cubic yards of grading.

3. Interior remodels.

4. Work to bring property into zoning conformity.

5. Any development on properties along Highway 101 or Lomas Santa Fe Drive, which is not visible from Highway 101 or Lomas Santa Fe Drive.

E. Submittal Requirements. In addition to the submittal requirements set forth in SBMC 17.68.040, applications for development review permits in the scenic area overlay zone (SAOZ) shall include the following:

1. A copy of the grading plan, if such plan is required pursuant to Chapter 15.40 SBMC.

2. A view analysis consisting of an accurate representation of the development as viewed from at least three separate and critical points exterior to the development site and which show the treatment of the scenic resources present on the site as related to those resources which are adjacent to the site. The exterior view points shall be proposed by the developer and approved by the director of community development and shall include any and all pertinent vista points shown in the general plan. The proposal shall include photographs of the development site taken from each of the proposed view points and a map showing the location of the view points with respect to the development site. At his discretion, the director may require additional view points to be included in the site plan.

F. Development Review Criteria. The general criterion of development review is that the proposed development shall not, to the maximum extent feasible, interfere with or degrade those visual features, natural or manmade, of the site or adjacent sites which contribute to its scenic attractiveness, as viewed from either the scenic highway or the adjacent scenic, historic, or recreational resource. In applying this general criterion, the following specific criteria shall be evaluated when they are applicable:

1. Building Characteristics. All development shall be compatible with the topography, vegetation and colors of the natural environment and with the scenic, historic and recreation resources of the designated areas.

2. Building and Structure Placement. The placement of buildings and structures shall not detract from the visual setting or obstruct significant views, and shall be compatible with the topography of the site and adjacent areas.

In prime viewshed areas designated in the general plan, building and structures should not be placed along bluff-top silhouette lines or on the adjacent slopes within view from a lagoon area, but should be clustered along the bases of the bluffs and on the mesa tops set back from the bluff-top silhouette lines. Buildings and structures should be sited to provide unobstructed view corridors from the nearest scenic highway, or view corridor road. These criteria may be modified when necessary to mitigate other overriding environmental considerations such as protection of habitat or wildlife corridors.

3. Landscaping. The removal of native vegetation shall be minimized and the replacement vegetation and landscaping shall be compatible with the vegetation of the designated area. Landscaping and plantings shall be used to the maximum extent practicable to screen those features listed in paragraphs (F)(4), (5) and (6) of this subsection. Landscaping and plantings shall not obstruct significant views, either when installed or when they reach mature growth.

4. Roads, Pedestrian Walkways, Parking and Storage Areas. Any development involving more than one building or structure shall provide common access roads and pedestrian walkways. Parking and outside storage areas shall be screened from view, to the maximum extent feasible, from either the scenic highway or the adjacent scenic, historic, or recreational resource. Acceptable screening methods shall include, but are not limited to, the use of existing topography, the strategic placement of buildings and structures, or landscaping and plantings which harmonize with the natural landscape of the designated area.

5. Aboveground Utilities. Utilities shall be constructed and routed underground except in those situations where natural features prevent undergrounding or where safety considerations necessitate aboveground construction and routing. Aboveground utilities shall be constructed and routed to minimize detrimental effects on the visual setting of the designated area. Where it is practical, aboveground utilities shall be screened from view from either the scenic highway or the adjacent scenic, historic, or recreational resource by existing topography, by the placement of buildings and structures, or by landscaping and plantings which harmonize with the natural landscape of the designated area.

6. Grading. The alteration of the natural topography of the site shall be minimized and shall avoid detrimental effects to the visual setting of the designated area and the existing natural drainage system. Alterations of the natural topography shall be screened from view from either the scenic highway or the adjacent scenic, historic, or recreational resource by landscaping and plantings which harmonize with the natural landscape of the designated area, except when such alterations add variety to or otherwise enhance the visual setting of the designated area. However, design emphasis shall be placed on preserving the existing quality of scenic resources rather than concealment of disturbances or replacement in kind. In portions of the scenic area overlay zone containing sensitive lands, grading may be severely restricted or prohibited.

7. Signs. Off-site signs shall be prohibited in areas subject to the scenic area overlay zone, except temporary real estate signs pursuant to SBMC 17.64.060. The number, size, location, and design of all other signs shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Sign Ordinance (Chapter 17.64 SBMC) and shall not detract from the visual setting of the designated area or obstruct significant views.

8. Lighting. The interior and exterior lighting of the buildings and structures and the lighting of signs, roads and parking areas shall be compatible with the lighting permitted in the designated area. All exterior lighting, including lighting in designated “dark sky” areas, shall be in conformance with SBMC 17.60.060 (Exterior Lighting Regulations). (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.48.020 Hillside overlay zone.

A. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to restrict the grading of natural slopes with an inclination of 25 percent or greater, in order to:

1. Preserve the natural topography and scenic qualities of the city;

2. Protect native coastal sage/chaparral and grassland habitat;

3. Preserve existing watersheds; and

4. Reduce the potential for environmental hazards including soil erosion, siltation of coastal wetlands, land slides, adverse impacts due to runoff, and other impacts which could affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

It is further recognized that two of the 23 areas designated as hillside overlay zone (HOZ) on the city of Solana Beach zoning map, herein referred to as the Barbara Avenue hillside and the Santa Helena/Lomas Santa Fe hillside, the limits of which have been defined in the Geologic Reconnaissance Study prepared by CTE, dated April 22, 2002, contain slopes with inclines greater than 25 percent that have been disturbed by grading activities and are atypical to other areas designated as HOZ. As such, these hillside areas containing slopes in excess of 25 percent inclination do not exist in a natural condition, and therefore limited grading and other development activity may be permitted in these areas provided that the activity is in compliance with the supplemental submittal and review techniques established herein. The supplemental submittal and review criteria are intended to assist the city in determining the suitability of development activity in these areas in order to effectively manage the potential impacts of development activity in these areas. More specifically, the purpose of the supplemental review criteria is to:

1. Regulate the design and intensity of development activity in these areas, in order to minimize its visibility and promote its integration with the natural surroundings;

2. Minimize soil erosion and site disturbance; 

3. Preserve existing drainage patterns;

4. Minimize potential impacts upon existing adjacent residential development.

B. Applicability of the Hillside Overlay Zone. The requirements of this section shall apply to all areas designated as hillside overlay zone (HOZ) on the city of Solana Beach zoning map, where site-specific analysis indicates that the parcel contains slopes exceeding 25 percent grade.

C. Development Review Permit Required. No building or grading permit shall be issued for any development on sites subject to the requirements of the hillside overlay zone until a development review permit has been submitted and approved in accordance with SBMC 17.68.040 (Development review permits) and the requirements herein.

D. Exemptions. The following are exempt from the requirements of the hillside overlay zone:

1. Any development for which site-specific analysis indicates that no portion of the project, including grading, would be located in slopes exceeding 25 percent slope. This analysis shall be based on map contour intervals not exceeding two feet and prepared by a qualified civil, soils or geotechnical engineer. Such slope analysis shall be administratively approved by the planning department to establish the permit exemption.

2. Minor additions including attached accessory structures to existing single-family residences which do not increase the existing building envelope or floor area by more than 10 percent or require more than 50 cubic yards of grading and such addition is not located on slopes of greater than 25 percent.

3. Detached accessory structures to single-family residences which do not exceed 10 percent of the total floor area of the principal structure or require more than 50 cubic yards of grading and such structure is not located on slopes of greater than 25 percent.

E. Submittal Requirements. In addition to the submittal requirements set forth in SBMC 17.68.040, applications for development review permits in the hillside overlay zone shall include:

1. A slope analysis based upon topographic map contour intervals not exceeding two feet. Such analysis shall be certified by a qualified civil, soils, or geotechnical engineer.

This analysis shall describe the following slope categories in acres and shall also graphically depict the location of each category on the topographic map:

a. Less than 25 percent slope.

b. 25 to 40 percent slope.

c. Greater than 40 percent slope.

2. A geological reconnaissance report where structures and improvements are proposed within any areas of greater than 25 percent slope pursuant to subsections F and G of this section.

Where unstable conditions are indicated, but in the opinion of the city engineer are not sufficiently defined in the geological reconnaissance report, a preliminary engineering geology report shall also be required. The preliminary engineering geology report shall include the results of subsurface investigations sufficient to identify the nature and magnitude of such unstable conditions, and shall identify alternative mitigation measures that may be needed.

F. Development Review Criteria for Slopes That Exist in a Natural Condition.

1. Development or grading shall not be permitted on slopes greater than 25 percent except where necessary to prevent the denial of all reasonable economic use of the property. Where such development is necessary, as much of the natural terrain shall be retained as possible.

2. Minor grading for the construction of one single-family dwelling unit and driveway for up to 20 percent of a legal lot consisting entirely of slopes of 25 percent or greater may be permitted if other nongrading approaches to development are not feasible.

3. All slopes over 25 percent grade which remain undisturbed or which are restored or enhanced as a result of a development approval shall be conserved as a condition of that approval through a deed restriction, open space easement, or other suitable device that will preclude any future development or grading of such slopes.

G. Supplemental Submittal Criteria for Development Activity on HOZ Slopes That Exist in an Unnatural Condition. In addition to the submittal requirements set forth in subsection E of this section, applications for development review permits in the Barbara Avenue hillside and the Santa Helena/Lomas Santa Fe hillside overlay zone areas shall include the following supplemental information:

1. Geotechnical report, prepared and stamped by a geotechnical engineer. Said report will evaluate site conditions, and recommend design measures necessary to reduce development risks and facilitate safe and stable development.

4. Detailed landscaping plan depicting the following:

a. Existing vegetation, boulders, and other natural features on the property, and identification of elements to be preserved and those to be removed;

b. Proposed landscaping and revegetation plan indicating all disturbed areas with the type, method and six-month schedule for proposed revegetation, the location, type, quantity and size of proposed landscaping, the type of privacy screening, where necessary, as well as provisions to establish and maintain landscaping;

c. Revegetation Bond. At the time of building permit issuance, the applicant may be required to enter into an agreement with the city that requires the applicant to furnish the city with a cash bond in an amount determined by the director of community development, for the purpose of ensuring implementation and completion of the revegetation plan. Said bond will be returned to the applicant upon city inspection demonstrating compliance with the revegetation plan.

5. Building elevations depicting the profile of the existing and proposed grade along each elevation, as well as proposed construction materials and colors. Color boards may also be required.

6. Visual Aids. Visual aids including roofline story poles erected pursuant to SBMC 17.63.040(B) and/or photographs of the site may be required to permit field observation of the impact of the proposed development on privacy and view shed. 

7. Acoustical analysis, if required to demonstrate compliance with the city’s noise ordinance.

8. Photometric plan, if required to demonstrate containment of all light sources within property lines.

H. Supplemental Development Regulations for Development Activity on Slopes That Exist in an Unnatural Condition.

1. Rear Yard Setback. The minimum rear yard setback for new structures or additions to existing structures, situated below-grade (below the ground elevation of the existing structure), shall be 40 feet from the property line. The minimum rear yard setback for at-grade structures (at the same ground elevation as the existing structure) shall be stepped back an additional 10 feet to create a minimum setback of 50 feet. Any new building structure or additions to existing structures with a building height exceeding 16 feet above existing grade is subject to the view assessment provisions of SBMC 17.63.040.

2. Accessory Encroachments. Swimming pools, spas, decks, fences, or walls in excess of 42 inches in height, except for required security or safety fencing up to five feet, and similar accessory structures are considered structures for the purpose of determining setbacks.

3. Rear Yard Buffer Area. A 20-foot-wide minimum landscape buffer shall be provided along the rear property line, in such a manner as to provide visual screening for adjacent residents to the west, as well as minimize view blockage for residents to the east. This buffer area shall be planted and maintained according to this section.

4. Grading Activities within the Landscape Buffer Area. Grading activities shall not be permitted within the 20-foot-wide landscape buffer area. 

5. Grading and Structures Immediately Adjacent to Landscape Area. Grading activities may be permitted in the area immediately adjacent to the landscape buffer to allow an avenue for the creation of a usable play area. Accessory structures greater than 42 inches in height, except for required security or safety fencing up to five feet, are not permitted within the 20-foot-wide area immediately adjacent to the landscape buffer area. Noncommercial playground equipment, such as swing sets, and play sets, are permitted within the 20-foot-wide area immediately adjacent to the landscape buffer area, as presently regulated in SBMC 17.20.020(C)(3). 

6. Maximum Height. As set forth in SBMC 17.20.030. 

7. Other Regulations. As set forth in SBMC 17.20.030.

I. Performance Standards for Development Activity on HOZ Slopes That Exist in an Unnatural Condition. The general criteria for development review is that the proposed development activity shall, to the maximum extent possible, reduce potential visual and spatial impacts of development activity by integrating development with its surroundings. In addition to the review criteria set forth in SBMC 17.48.010, development review permits in the Barbara Avenue and the Santa Helena/Lomas Santa Fe hillside overlay zone areas shall meet the intent of the following performance-based review criteria:

1. Site Design. The site design should incorporate the existing natural features and terrain taking into consideration the contours of the land. The building form should follow the natural contours of the land. The site design and structure should take into consideration the impacts on privacy and views of neighboring properties. Window placement, landscaping, deck and other accessory structure placement should be carefully planned to ensure adjacent properties are not compromised. 

2. Building Form. The slopes of the roof should follow the natural contours (i.e., oriented in the same direction as the slope). The bulk of the building should be broken up by incorporating varied roof heights rather than having just one or two massive roof planes. Expansive facades shall be avoided by offsetting walls and architectural elements to produce patterns of light and shade. Second stories shall be set back from the first floor as specified herein to step with the slope so that bulk is minimized.

3. Fences and Retaining Walls. Solid fencing should be avoided where visible to the public. Retaining walls should be landscaped so that they blend with surroundings and reduce visual impacts. 

4. Color and Materials. Exterior colors of all structures shall use natural dark, or earth tones. Light, bright and reflective materials are to be avoided.

5. Vegetation shall be used to blend structures with the surrounding landscape, soften the impact of development on manufactured slopes, and provide erosion control. Landscaping shall be used to screen views of down slope elevations. Landscaping material shall consist of native or naturalized plant material that blends naturally with the landscape and provides screening. An irrigation system that utilizes water and energy conservation techniques, sufficient to establish, and if required, facilitate revegetation and minimize erosion shall be used. Required rear yard landscape buffer areas shall be planted with land material that is sufficient in size and quantity to adequately buffer and screen views from down slope elevations to minimize impacts within existing adjacent residential development. Landscaping shall not exceed the height of adjacent rooflines, either when installed or when they reach maturity. 

6. Lighting. All exterior lighting shall be designed pursuant to SBMC 17.48.010(F)(8).

7. Noise. Noise levels shall not exceed the dBA levels set forth in the city of Solana Beach noise ordinance. Intervening structures may be required to be incorporated into the site design to minimize noise impacts.

J. Findings of Fact. In addition to the findings required by SBMC 17.63.040(F)(2) through (5), development activity within the Barbara Avenue and Santa Helena/Lomas Santa Fe hillside areas shall only be allowed if the city council finds the following:

1. The development activity meets the intent of all performance standards set forth herein;

2. The development has been designed so that its visibility has been effectively minimized and integrated in the natural surroundings to the extent feasible;

3. Soil erosion and site disturbance has been effectively minimized; 

4. Drainage patterns have been preserved;

5. Potential impacts upon existing adjacent residential development have been minimized to the extent feasible;

6. Development has been sited so that it is compatible with existing surrounding development in terms of height, bulk and scale;

7. Adequate drainage and utility facilities are available to serve the subject property, while maintaining sufficient levels of services for existing development;

8. Potential lighting and noise impacts upon existing adjacent residential development has been effectively minimized;

9. The cumulative visual impact of the development activity, as viewed from west to east, has been effectively mitigated. (Ord. 298 § 1, 2003; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.48.030 Floodplain overlay zone.

A. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that development and fill in the 100-year floodplain of the San Dieguito River Valley, where permitted, will not constitute an unreasonable, undesirable, or unnecessary obstruction to flood flow and that such development will not adversely effect coastal wetlands, riparian areas, or other sensitive habitat areas within the floodplain.

B. Applicability of the Floodplain Overlay Zone. The requirements of this section shall apply to all areas designated as floodplain overlay zone (FPOZ) on the city of Solana Beach zoning map. Such zoning shall include all areas identified as within the 100-year floodplain on maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Nothing in this section shall preclude the need to comply with the flood damage prevention overlay zone as prescribed in Chapter 17.80 SBMC.

C. Development Review Permit Required. No building or grading permit shall be issued for any development in areas subject to the floodplain overlay zone until a development review permit has been submitted and approved in accordance with SBMC 17.68.040 (Development Review Permits) and this section.

D. Exemptions. The following are exempt from the requirements of the floodplain overlay zone:

1. A single-family residence on a single lot including accessory structures thereto which is located at least one foot above the 100-year flood level and is otherwise designed to withstand periodic flooding.

E. Development Review Criteria. Within the 100-year floodplain of the San Dieguito River Valley, permanent structures and/or fill for permanent structures, roads and other public improvements consistent with the general plan and local coastal program land use plan will only be allowed if the applicant can demonstrate the following:

1. The development is capable of withstanding periodic flooding, and does not require the construction of off-site flood protective works including, but not limited to, artificial flood channels, revetments, and levees. Fill required to raise the development above the 100-year flood level shall be permitted consistent with this criteria. Flood protection works may be permitted to protect new or existing roads which are identified in the general plan circulation element.

2. Existing environmentally sensitive habitat areas will not be significantly adversely affected.

3. The development will not result in a net reduction of existing riparian habitat areas within the floodplain. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.48.040 Scaled residential overlay zone.

A. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to preserve and enhance the existing community character and aesthetic quality of the city of Solana Beach, by providing regulations to ensure and protect the character of established residential neighborhoods; and by preserving the traditional scale and seaside orientation of residential areas in the city of Solana Beach (see also SBMC 17.04.020).

B. Applicability of the Scaled Residential Overlay Zone. The requirements of this section shall apply to all areas designated as being within the scaled residential overlay zone (SROZ) on the city of Solana Beach zoning map. The SROZ includes only low residential (LR); low medium residential (LMR); and medium residential (MR) zones, in six geographical areas, west of the Interstate 5 freeway, as indicated on the city of Solana Beach official zoning map, on file with the city clerk, and available at the department of community development. The SROZ allows the same densities and uses as the underlying residential zones, but requires superseding development regulations for floor area ratios, and definitions of atriums, bay windows, and basements. For the purposes of these regulations all areas within the SROZ shall be known as “designated areas.”

C. Development Standards.

1. Floor Area Ratios. For purposes of determining the allowable floor area ratio (FAR) within the SROZ, all development shall be required to comply with a four-tiered standard as follows:

a. Four-tiered standard: 0.500 for the first 6,000 square feet of lot size; plus 0.175 for that portion of the lot 6,001 up to 15,000 square feet; plus 0.100 for that portion of the lot 15,001 up to 20,000 square feet; plus 0.050 for that portion of the lot greater than 20,000 square feet (see chart below for example).

	Example of 16,000-Square-Foot Lot

	0.500 for first 6,000 s.f. 	3,000

	0.175 for 6,001 to 15,000 s.f.	1,575

	0.100 for 15,001 to 20,000 s.f.	100

	Subtotal	4,675

	Add: Garage exemption	400

	Total	5,075

b. Atriums, as defined in this section, are to be included in the calculations to determine the allowable FAR within the SROZ.

c. Required parking within garages (200 square feet per space up to a maximum of 400 square feet for a single-family residence and 200 square feet for an accessory living unit) shall be excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio.

2. Bay Window Size and Placement. The placement of bay windows shall be allowed to extend into the setback such that they may not exceed a maximum dimension of three feet by four feet by two feet (depth), with one such window allowed per each 20 feet of linear building fronting the property line.

3. Definitions. For purposes of these provisions, “atrium” shall be defined as an outdoor area that (a) is typically open or semi-open (i.e., partially roofed) and (b) is substantially, if not completely, surrounded on all sides by walls of the structure with which the outdoor area is associated.

4. FAR calculations exclude:

a. Basement. The floor area of the basement portions of residential buildings calculated as follows:

i. Basement – No Exposed Side(s). Floor area of the entire basement level when the finished floor of the level above the floor area of the basement level at any point (including the top finished height of any lightwell opening) is no more than three feet above the adjacent natural or finished grade, whichever is lower. Such floor area may abut lightwells which measure not more than four feet in width (perpendicular to the building wall) nor more than 20 feet in length (parallel to the building wall) and are not deeper than 28 inches above the finished floor. Such lightwells may occupy no more than 40 percent of the lineal perimeter of that level of the building.

ii. Basement – Exposed Side(s). A portion of the floor area of the entire basement level having an exposed side or sides when the finished floor of the level above the floor area of that basement level at any point (including the top finished height of any lightwell opening) is more than three feet above the adjacent natural or finished grade, whichever is lower. Such exposure shall only be continuous, and limited to not more than two sides and not more than 40 percent of the perimeter of that level. For each linear foot of the perimeter of a level that is exposed more than three feet between the lower of the natural or finished grade and the level of the finished floor above, two percent of the floor area of that basement level shall contribute to the calculation of FAR (the “two percent formula”). If the foregoing requirements are not satisfied, then the entire floor area of the level having an exposed side or sides will be included in the computation of bulk floor area.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the basement level having one exposed side is constructed for use as vehicle parking and it is the only garage, then the first 400 square feet of such garage is excluded from the calculation of FAR.

Example: If the basement is a customary two-car garage of 400 square feet (20 feet by 20 feet equals 400 square feet), then the floor area to be included in the computation of the FAR is as follows:

	20' x 20' = 400 sq. ft.

	exposure = 18' (two-car garage door opening)

	400 x 18 x 2% = 144 sq. ft. included in computation of FAR (except none of the 144 sq. ft. will be included in FAR because the first 400 sq. ft. are not included if the basement is the only garage for vehicle parking)

Lightwells which measure not more than four feet in width (perpendicular to the building wall) nor more than 20 feet in length (parallel) to the building wall and are no deeper than 28 inches above the finished floor shall be calculated as exposed perimeter but need not be continuous with the “exposed” side or sides of the building.

iii. Basement – Attached to Garage. Notwithstanding subsection (C)(4)(a)(ii) of this section to the contrary, if the floor area of the basement level having an exposed side (which is contiguous with not more than one side and not more than 40 percent of the perimeter of that level) is constructed for use as vehicle parking (e.g., a functioning garage door is installed) (“garage”) and residential living area is on the same level and contiguous with the floor area of the garage, then the two percent formula set forth in subsection (C)(4)(a)(ii) of this section shall not apply to the floor area of the residential living area on that level. The floor area of the residential living area (e.g., nongarage floor area) on that level shall be excluded from the calculation of FAR if (A) at least 500 square feet is attributed to the garage (notwithstanding the actual floor area of the garage), (B) the garage is permanently separated from the residential living floor area of that level (e.g., separated by floor-to-ceiling structural walls, with the exception of doorways or openings sufficient for passage through such walls), and (C) there are not any exposed side or sides of the portion of the level designed for residential living area where any portion of the finished floor over the floor area of that level at any point is more than three feet above the adjacent natural or finished grade, whichever is lower. For purposes of this section the word “side” shall mean the exterior wall or walls of a structure as viewed from any single point and which could be depicted as an elevation on an architectural rendering.

5. Floor Levels Above Basement. Three-level building facades are prohibited. When a basement, including a below grade garage, has one or more exposed side(s) when the finished floor of the level above the floor area of that basement level at any point (including the top finished height of any lightwell opening) is more than three feet above the adjacent natural or finished grade, whichever is lower (excluding lightwells as provided herein), then the floor area of a third level shall not be directly above the floor area of the basement in order to prevent the appearance of a three-level facade. In addition, the floor area of a third level shall be set back at least 10 feet from the portion of the perimeter of the exposed side(s) of the basement level (i.e., the second level is the level above the basement level). (Ord. 357 § 5, 2007)

C. Shared parking facilities shall not be located further than 600 feet from any structure or use served, unless it can be shown that increased distances are feasible through use alternative transportation modes such as shuttle services.

D. A written agreement, covenant, deed restriction or other document as determined necessary by the hearing authority shall be executed by all parties to assure the continued availability of the shared parking spaces for the life of the proposed development or use. (Ord. 191 § 1, 1994; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.52.060 Off-site parking.

Pursuant to a conditional use permit issued by the city council the requested off-street automobile parking for a commercial use, whether required or not by this title, may be provided off-site; provided the following requirements are met:

A. The proposed off-site location is within 600 feet walking distance from the nearest point of the parking facility to the nearest point of the commercial building that such property is required to serve.

B. The proposed off-site location is easily accessible to the property being served and is not located across a major street or highway.

C. Adequate signage is provided to direct vehicles to the off-site parking.

D. The proposed off-site location shall be in a commercial or industrial zone.

E. The off-site location is on property owned or leased by the owner(s) of the premises containing the uses to be served.

1. If the off-site location is leased, the use permit shall be conditioned to automatically expire upon termination of the lease. Such lease may not otherwise be terminated without the approval of the city unless the use for which the parking is provided is eliminated. Said lease shall contain a description of the number of parking spaces held under lease and shall be recorded with the San Diego County recorder’s office and shall be binding on all heirs, assigns, or successors in interest.

2. If the off-site location is owned, such site shall be considered to be an inseparable part of the lot or parcels containing the uses to be served and the owners shall record with the county recorder’s office a covenant running with the land for the benefit of the city guaranteeing that such owner(s) and their heirs, assigns, or successors in interest, will continue to maintain said off-site parking facilities so long as the building or use they are intended to serve is maintained. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)

17.56.010 Purpose.

The State Legislature determined in the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act (the “Act”), Government Code Sections 65591 et seq., that the state’s water resources are in limited supply. The Legislature also recognized that while landscaping is essential to the quality of life in California, landscape design, installation, maintenance and management must be water efficient. The general purpose of this chapter is to establish water use standards for landscaping in the city that implement the 2006 development landscape design requirements established by the Act and amended by Executive Order No. B-29-15. Consistent with the Legislature’s findings, the purpose of this chapter is to:

A. Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water.

B. Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible.

C. Promote the use, when available, of tertiary treated recycled water, for irrigating landscaping.

D. Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance (MAWA) as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use for landscaping to the lowest practical amount.

E. Encourage water users of existing landscapes to use water efficiently and without waste.

F. Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California’s environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of the Ordinance, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:

1. Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and aesthetic benefits.

2. Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.

3. Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment.

4. Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion.

5. Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of action. (Ord. 467, 2015; Ord. 430, 2011)


17.56.020 Findings.

This chapter implements the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act. The requirements of this chapter reduce water use associated with irrigation of outdoor landscaping by setting a maximum amount of water to be applied to landscaping and by designing, installing and maintaining water efficient landscapes consistent with the water allowance. The provisions of this chapter are equivalent to or at least as effective, where deviations have been made, to the provisions of the State Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance and Executive Order No. B-29-15. 

The requirements herein are intended to reduce water usage in Solana Beach to the same extent as the Model Landscape Ordinance prepared by the state of California and Executive Order No. B-29-15. In implementing this law, the city shall endeavor to apply the law in a manner which will result in long-term water savings to the citizens of the state as required by law. The water savings shall be achieved through permanent landscape rules using irrigation management, greater use of drought-tolerant plantings and improved design criteria. 

In adopting this chapter, the city council finds and determines that this chapter will be as effective as the State Model Landscape Ordinance and Executive Order No. B-29-15. (Ord. 467, 2015; Ord. 430, 2011)

The objectionable characteristics of these uses are further heightened by their concentration in any one area, thereby having deleterious effects on adjacent areas.

These regulations are intended to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods or land uses. The following objectives have been formulated to prevent the concentration of adult entertainment uses in any one area, to restrict their accessibility to minors, to maintain neighborhood vitality and economy, and to ensure the same high standards of site planning, architecture and landscape design required of all commercial developments.

B. Definitions.

1. Adult Business. For the purposes of this section an “adult business” shall mean any commercial activity where for any form of consideration more than 15 percent of the total display, shelf, rack, table, stand, or floor area is utilized for one or more of the following:

a. The presentation of material which has a substantial component of its theme, the depiction, illustration, or description of specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities.

b. The presentation of a live performance which has as a substantial component of its presentation, the depiction, illustration, or description of specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities.

c. The display or exposure of specified anatomical areas.

d. The display or exposure of specified sexual activities.

b. Human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, or in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal even if completely and opaquely covered.

3. Specified Sexual Activities. As used herein, “specified sexual activities” shall mean and include any of the following:

a. The fondling or other touching of human genitals, pubic region, buttocks, anus or female breasts;

b. Sex acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, including intercourse, oral copulation or sodomy;

c. Masturbation, actual or simulated;

d. Excretory functions, menstruation, vaginal or anal irrigation as part of or in connection with any other activities set forth in (a) through (c) above.

C. Conditional Use Permit Required. An adult entertainment use shall only be permitted by conditional use permit as issued by the city council in accordance with SBMC 17.68.010. Specific conditions providing for the development, operation, and design of such a use shall be imposed by the city council.

D. General Regulations.

1. Each adult business establishment shall be located a minimum of 500 feet from an existing adult business. Such measurement shall be the horizontal distance measured between the nearest property lines of the proposed use and the existing adult business.

2. Each adult business shall be located a minimum of 200 feet from any residentially zoned area, church, school, or park. Such measurement shall be the horizontal distance between the property line of the proposed adult business and the nearest residential zoning line or property line of any church, school, or park.

17.60.130 Sidewalk cafes and outdoor eating areas.

A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of these regulations is to encourage outdoor eating areas and sidewalk cafes as visual amenities which intensify pedestrian activity and make street life more attractive in commercial areas, to promote and protect public health, safety, and general welfare, to preserve and enhance the character of neighborhoods, and to ensure adequate space for pedestrians.

B. Definitions.

1. An “outdoor eating area” is a portion of a restaurant, located between the front setback of a building and the street, which is used exclusively for dining, drinking and circulation therein. Outdoor eating areas include sidewalk cafes.

2. A “sidewalk cafe” is a portion of a restaurant, located within the sidewalk area of the public right-of-way, which is used exclusively for dining, drinking and circulation therein. A sidewalk cafe may provide waiter or waitress service or self-service.



C. Conditional Use Permit Required. A sidewalk cafe shall only be permitted by conditional use permit issued by the director of community development or city council in accordance with SBMC 17.68.010. Specific conditions providing for the development, operation, and design of such a use shall be imposed by the director of community development or the city council.

Outdoor eating areas which do not include a sidewalk cafe do not require a conditional use permit but shall comply with all applicable regulations below.

D. Regulations. All outdoor eating areas, including sidewalk cafes, shall comply with the following regulations as applicable:

1. Clear Path.

a. For sidewalk cafes, there shall be a minimum clear distance, which is free of all obstructions, of 50 percent of the sidewalk width or four feet, whichever is greater. The minimum distance may be measured from any point within the sidewalk width; provided the clear path is maintained in a continuous line conforming to the curvature of the sidewalk. Portions of the sidewalk cafe may be located on either side of the clear path thereby creating two distinct perimeters. In no event may recesses in the sidewalk cafe frontage be used to satisfy this unobstructed width requirement except that corners of the sidewalk cafe may be rounded or mitered. For the purposes of the minimum clear path, parking meters, traffic signs, and trees which have gratings flush to grade, without fence or guards, shall not count as obstructions. Within a sidewalk cafe perimeter located on the street side of a clear path, tables and chairs may be located between sidewalk obstructions such as trees, light standards, planters, news racks, mail boxes, benches and similar fixtures; provided such public facilities remain accessible.

b. At the intersection of streets a minimum clearance, free of all obstructions, measured from the outer edge of the sidewalk cafe to the curb side or nearest obstruction, shall be required as determined by the city engineer. The corner of the sidewalk cafe wall may be rounded or mitered.

2. Cafe Boundary. No portion of a sidewalk cafe, such as gates or any objects placed within a sidewalk cafe, shall swing or project beyond the designated exterior perimeter of the sidewalk cafe. However, fire exit doors, which are used exclusively as emergency exit doors, shall be exempt from this provision.

3. Location. No portion of an outdoor eating area shall be located within eight feet of the entrance to a ground floor commercial use other than an entrance to an outdoor eating area. An exception to the minimum distance between outdoor eating areas and adjacent business entrances may be granted up to zero feet after review of existing conditions in that commercial area on that particular street by the director of community development and all other appropriate departments, and upon the affected adjacent property and first floor tenant(s) having given notarized written permission for an encroachment. The review will take into consideration the effect that the exception may have on adjoining businesses in terms of visibility and access.

4. Access For Persons with Physical Disabilities. An outdoor eating area and its restaurant shall be directly accessible to persons with physical disabilities. In the event the main restaurant has provided such access, the outdoor eating area shall be accessible to persons with disabilities from the interior of the restaurant. In order to ensure access for persons with physical disabilities:

a. At least one door leading into the outdoor eating area or restaurant from the adjoining sidewalk shall be not less than three feet wide.

b. A ramp with nonskid surface, if there is change of grade, having a minimum width of three feet and a slope of not greater than one inch in height for every 12 inches of horizontal distance shall be provided. Such ramp may be of portable type for cafes which are six feet wide or less, except if the cafe is 180 square feet in area or greater.

5. General Design Considerations.

a. Fixtures.

i. Sidewalk cafes may contain readily removable railings or fencing or any combination of removable railings, fencing, and landscaping in planter boxes to separate the encroachment area from the remainder of the sidewalk.

ii. No solid walls shall be permitted in the right-of-way. Solid walls and wind screens are permitted in outdoor eating areas outside of the right-of-way.

iii. The furnishings of the interior of a sidewalk cafe shall consist of readily movable tables, movable chairs, and movable umbrellas. For the purposes of this section “readily movable” shall mean that no object such as a table, chair, planter, or any other fixture, shall be leaded, cemented, nailed, bolted, power riveted, screwed, or affixed, even in a temporary manner, to either the sidewalk or to any other structure which it abuts.

iv. Landscaping may be placed either in movable planters or planted in the ground inside the defined cafe area adjacent to any barrier, railing fence, or combination thereof.

v. Lighting and heating fixtures may be permanently affixed onto the exterior front of the main building. Portable heating units may be used in all outdoor cafes.

b. Signage. Only the following signs are permitted within an outdoor eating area or sidewalk cafe:

i. The name and type of establishment may appear on the umbrellas or the valance of an awning.

ii. A movable menu board, not to exceed eight square feet, shall be allowed within the boundaries of the outdoor eating area or sidewalk cafe.

c. Refuse Storage Area. No structure or enclosure to accommodate the storage of trash or garbage shall be erected or placed on, adjacent to, or separate from a sidewalk cafe on the public right-of-way.

d. Safety.

i. All barriers, railings, or fences placed around a sidewalk cafe shall be contiguous to the sidewalk. The barriers shall be adequately designed so that unsafe conditions are not created for the physically disabled, blind and partially sighted. In order to maximize visual access and pedestrian safety, the height of the railing, barrier, fence, or planter within the right-of-way shall not exceed three feet in elevation.

ii. Adequate lighting of barriers and railings for stairways and sidewalks shall be provided.

iii. No cantilevered projections over a public right-of-way or other pedestrian walkway shall be permitted. A change in paving pattern and texture may be required to alert pedestrians of a change in sidewalk use.

iv. Awnings or umbrellas may be used in conjunction with all outdoor eating areas. For sidewalk cafes within the public right-of-way, awnings shall be adequately secured, retractable and shall be constructed and installed to the satisfaction of the building official. At no point shall the height of the awning including the valance be less than seven feet from the floor of a sidewalk cafe.

v. Sidewalk cafes should be at the same elevation as the adjoining sidewalk. However, in the event of a grade change, consideration may be given to permit the floor level of the sidewalk cafe to be elevated or depressed.

6. Environmental Compatibility.

a. The outdoor eating area should fit in with the character of the area and reinforce the aspect of outdoor pedestrian plazas/park settings.

b. The scale of an outdoor cafe should be compact, and suggest intimacy, charm and functionality through materials, landscaping, signs, and use.

c. The hours of operation of an outdoor eating area shall be limited to the hours of operation of the associated eating or drinking establishment.

E. Encroachment Permit Required. An encroachment permit shall be required for a sidewalk cafe in accordance with the provisions of SBMC 11.20.200 and shall be applied for and processed concurrently with the application for a conditional use permit.

F. Liability Insurance. The permittee shall agree to hold the city of Solana Beach harmless and indemnify the city of Solana Beach from and against all claims, demands, costs, losses, damages, injuries, litigation, and liability arising out of or related to the use of the public property by the permittee or permittee’s agents, employees, contractors, or guests. The permittee shall also give evidence of liability insurance in an amount determined by the issuing authority to be sufficient to deal with the maximum amount of potential liability related to permittee’s use of the public property, and such additional terms as the issuing authority deems appropriate. The issuing authority may require an additional bond to be posted as security for the performance of permittee’s obligation to repair all public property damaged as a result of permittee’s use of the public property.

If the city council finds that the building, structure, site, or collection of buildings or sites has historic, cultural, archaeological or architectural values significant in the history of the city, the city council may initiate the hearings to designate such building, structure, or site as a historic/cultural landmark. Designation of historic/ cultural landmarks may include sites listed on the National Register of Historic Sites or sites listed as California Registered Landmarks; however, the city may designate sites which are not listed on federal or state registers.

F. Action Following Initiation of Hearings. Following the initiation of the public hearings to designate a historic/cultural landmark, the planning director shall schedule and notice the required public hearing before the city council to reclassify the subject property to apply a historic/cultural landmark designator which will subject the property to the regulations of this section.

G. Development Review Permit Required. No building or grading permit shall be issued for the construction or alteration of any building or structure, or site (nor shall any person construct or alter a building, structure, or site) which has a historic/cultural landmark designator applied to the building, structure, or site until a development review permit has been submitted and approved in accordance with SBMC 17.68.040 (Development Review Permits) and the criteria and procedures established by this section. A development review permit is not required for alterations to the interior of a structure which the planning director finds do not degrade or detract from the historic, cultural, archaeological or architectural resource values which qualify the structure as a designated historic/cultural landmark.

H. Submittal Requirements. In addition to the submittal requirements set forth in SBMC 17.68.040, applications for development review permits involving a designated historic/ cultural landmark shall include a site plan containing such textural description and plans, sketches, and drawings as are necessary to show:

1. The existing or proposed use and design of the premises, building, or structure;

2. The historic, cultural, archaeological or architectural resource value or significance of a building or structure based upon research of historic archives, photographs and other documents; and

3. The relationship of the proposed use, building or structure to the historic, cultural, archaeological or architectural resources of the designated historic/cultural landmark.

I. Development Review Criteria. The general criterion of the development review is that the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or relocation of any building, structure, or site shall enhance, to the maximum extent feasible, and not interfere with, detract from or degrade the historic, cultural, architectural or archaeological resource values of the designated historic/cultural landmark. In applying this general criterion, the following specific criteria shall be evaluated when they are applicable:

1. Compatibility of Use. The use proposed for a building, structure, or site without structure shall be compatible with the uses predominating in the designated area.

2. Compatibility of Design. All development, demolitions, relocations, conversions, or other alterations occurring on designated historic/ cultural landmark properties shall be in keeping with the architectural style and scale characterizing the period of history in which the structure was built, and shall be in keeping with the landscaping and architectural features which caused the property to be so designated as a historic/cultural landmark. Restoration efforts shall be in keeping with details, materials, textures, colors, and landscape features common to the period of history when the designated landmark was constructed. Where necessary, alternative building regulations shall be applied pursuant to Part 2 of Title 24 of the California Administrative Code, entitled “The Historic Building Code.”

J. Demolition or Relocation of Designated Historic/Cultural Landmarks.

1. No person shall demolish, destroy, or move all or any part of a designated historic/cultural landmark, nor shall any permit be issued for such demolition, moving or earth movement, unless a conditional use permit has been approved by the city council in accordance with SBMC 17.68.010. Violators will be prosecuted and punished to the maximum extent permitted by law, which includes complete restoration of the damaged site (see SBMC 17.72.120, Enforcement and Penalties, subsection C, Violators Punishable by Fine and Imprisonment).

2. A conditional use permit for demolition or moving of a designated historic/cultural landmark shall not be approved unless the city council finds that one or more of the following conditions exist:

a. A structure is a hazard to the public health or safety, and repairs or stabilization are not physically possible.

b. The site is required for a public use which will be of more benefit to the public than the historic/cultural landmark and there is no alternative location for the public use.

c. Retention of such landmark or structure thereon would cause undue financial hardship to the owner. “Undue financial hardship” shall be defined as a situation in which there is no use for which the premises can reasonably be used which would provide an overall economic benefit or income sufficient to maintain the site or structure. An application for demolition or moving of a designated historic/cultural landmark on grounds of financial hardship shall include information adequate to justify such hardship.

3. A conditional use permit for demolition of a designated historic/cultural landmark shall not be approved unless the structure or object cannot be moved or relocated.

4. A conditional use permit for the relocation of a designated historic/cultural landmark shall not be approved unless the relocation will not destroy the historical, cultural, archaeological or architectural values of the historic/cultural landmark, and the relocation is part of a definitive series of actions which will assure the preservation of the historic/cultural landmark. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.60.170 Live/work use.

A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to make new and existing light industrial and commercial buildings available as joint living and working quarters for individuals and families engaged in the arts and crafts, small scale custom manufacturing, special commercial retail, and similar creative endeavors; increase the supply of low-income housing in the form of live/work units; and encourage the preservation of existing buildings which are structurally sound and aesthetically worthy, while protecting the primary uses within each zoning district.

1. The minimum total square footage of an individual live/work unit shall be 500 square feet.

2. New live/work buildings (excluding conversions) shall provide a minimum of four units.

3. Any commercial zone in which a live/work use is located shall remain a commercial zone and the occupant of the live/work use by selecting this type of occupancy accepts the conditions found in the area including, but not limited to, noise, pollution, fumes, dirt, traffic and odors to the extent that they are permitted by law in the zone. The director of community development or city council may include conditions to this effect which would be recorded as part of the conditional use permit.

4. The living space shall not be rented or sold separately from the working space.

5. Vehicular parking and loading spaces shall be established by the conditional use permit based on the proposed uses and by review of a parking/loading report prepared by the applicant.

6. All building, fire, electrical, mechanical and other applicable codes shall be adhered to including the American Disabilities Act unless specifically exempted by said codes. City staff shall exercise discretion in interpreting such codes to encourage live/work projects, but shall not compromise public health, safety and welfare standards. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.60.180 Emergency shelters.

A. Purpose and Intent. This section establishes standards for the development and operation of emergency shelters in the general commercial zone. In compliance with SB 2, effective January 1, 2008, emergency shelters shall be allowed as a permitted use without the need for a conditional use permit and are exempt from CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act).

B. Emergency Shelter Regulations. Emergency shelters shall be subject to the following regulations:

1. Eligible Locations. A new facility shall be a permitted use in the general commercial (C) zone only, and may be located in the public/institutional zone with a director’s use permit.

2. Separation Between Emergency Shelters. A new emergency shelter shall not be closer than 300 feet to another emergency shelter as measured between property lines.

3. Lighting. Adequate external lighting shall be provided for security purposes to ensure fully lit parking, gathering and waiting areas. Lighting shall be contained on site per SBMC 17.60.060, Exterior lighting regulations.

4. Building Design Standards.

c. Length of Stay. Temporary shelter shall be available to residents for a maximum of six months.

d. Hours of Operation. The emergency shelter shall only accept clients between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (Ord. 445 § 12, 2014)


17.60.190 Prohibited marijuana activities.

A. Legislative Findings and Statement of Purpose.

1. The city council finds that prohibitions on commercial marijuana activities, marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing, marijuana delivery, and marijuana dispensaries are necessary for the preservation and protection of the public health, safety, and welfare for the city and its community and is consistent with federal law that makes the manufacture, possession or use of marijuana to be a crime. The city council’s prohibition of such activities is within the authority conferred upon the city council by federal and state law. 

2. On October 9, 2015, the Governor signed the “Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act” (the “MMRS Act”) into law. The MMRS Act becomes effective January 1, 2016, and contains new statutory provisions that allow local agencies to regulate or ban the cultivation, storage, manufacture, transport, delivery, provision, or other related activities pertaining to medical marijuana. 

3. The city council finds that the state is not authorized to issue a license for the cultivation of medical marijuana within the city because Health and Safety Code Section 11362.777(b)(3) provides that the Department of Food and Agriculture may not issue a state license to cultivate medical marijuana within a city that prohibits cultivation. 

4. The city council further finds that state licensed dispensaries shall not deliver medical marijuana within the city because Business and Professions Code Section 19340(a) expressly prohibits the delivery of marijuana in a local jurisdiction that has explicitly prohibited the delivery by ordinance. 

5. On November 8, 2016, the state voters approved the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, also identified as Proposition 64 (“Prop 64”). Prop 64 legalized adult non-medical use of marijuana and established a state licensing scheme for non-medical marijuana facilities largely patterned on the MMRS Act, and generally: (1) allows adults 21 years and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and cultivate up to six plants for personal use; (2) regulates and taxes the production, manufacture, and sale of marijuana for adult use; (3) allows local regulation and taxation of marijuana; (4) prohibits smoking marijuana in places where smoking tobacco is prohibited; and (5) rewrites criminal penalties so as to reduce the most common marijuana felonies to misdemeanors and allow prior offenders to petition for reduced charges. Prop 64, similar to the MMRS Act, allows cities and counties to prohibit the establishment of non-medical facilities and licenses that are provided under Prop 64, providing for minimal personal use exceptions.

6. The city council finds that the state is not authorized to issue licenses for commercial marijuana activities within the city because Business and Professions Code Section 26055(e) provides that the state may not issue a state license for any commercial marijuana activities within a city that prohibits such activities.

B. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 

1. “Commercial marijuana activity” includes the cultivation, possession, manufacture, distribution, processing, storing, laboratory testing, labeling, transportation, distribution, delivery, or sale of marijuana and marijuana products.

2. “Delivery” means the commercial transfer of marijuana or marijuana products to a customer, qualified patient or primary caregiver. “Delivery” also includes the use by a marijuana dispensary or retailer of any technology platform owned and controlled by a marijuana dispensary or retailer that enables customers, qualified patients, or primary caregivers to arrange for or facilitate the commercial transfer by a licensed dispensary or retailer of marijuana or marijuana products. 

3. “Marijuana” means any or all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa Linnaeus, Cannabis indica, or Cannabis ruderalis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin or separated resin, whether crude or purified, extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds or resin, including marijuana infused in foodstuff or any other ingestible or consumable product containing marijuana. The term “marijuana” shall also include “medical marijuana” as such phrase is used in the August 2008 Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana Grown for Medical Use, as may be amended from time to time, that was issued by the office of the Attorney General for the state of California or subject to the provisions of California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 (Compassionate Use Act of 1996) or California Health and Safety Code Sections 11362.7 to 11362.83 (Medical Marijuana Program Act). 

4. “Marijuana cultivation” means growing, planting, harvesting, drying, curing, grading, trimming, or processing of marijuana.

5. “Marijuana processing” means any method used to prepare marijuana or its byproducts for commercial retail and/or wholesale, including but not limited to: drying, cleaning, curing, packaging, and extraction of active ingredients to create marijuana related products and concentrates.  

6. “Marijuana dispensary” or “marijuana dispensaries” means any business, office, store, facility, location, retail storefront or wholesale component of any establishment, cooperative or collective that delivers whether mobile or otherwise, dispenses, distributes, exchanges, transmits, transports, sells or provides marijuana to any person for any reason, including members of any medical marijuana cooperative or collective consistent with the August 2008 Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana Grown for Medical Use, as may be amended from time to time, that was issued by the office of the Attorney General for the state of California, or for the purposes set forth in California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 (Compassionate Use Act of 1996) or California Health and Safety Code Sections 11362.7 to 11362.83 (Medical Marijuana Program Act). 

7. “Medical marijuana collective” or “cooperative or collective” means any group that is collectively or cooperatively cultivating and distributing marijuana for medical purposes that is organized in the manner set forth in the August 2008 Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana Grown for Medical Use, as may be amended from time to time, that was issued by the office of the Attorney General for the state of California or subject to the provisions of California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 (Compassionate Use Act of 1996) or California Health and Safety Code Sections 11362.7 to 11362.83 (Medical Marijuana Program Act). 

C. Prohibited Activities. Commercial marijuana activities, marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing, marijuana delivery, and marijuana dispensaries shall be prohibited activities in the city, except where the city is preempted by federal or state law from enacting a prohibition on any such activity. No use permit, variance, building permit, or any other entitlement, license, or permit, whether administrative or discretionary, shall be approved or issued for commercial marijuana activities, marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing, marijuana delivery, or the establishment or operation of a marijuana dispensary or medical marijuana collective in the city, and no person shall otherwise establish or conduct such activities in the city, except where the city is preempted by federal or state law from enacting a prohibition on any such activity for which the use permit, variance, building permit, or any other entitlement, license, or permit is sought. 

D. Public Nuisance. Any violation of this chapter is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.

E. Violations. To the extent not preempted by state law, any person or business that violates any provision of this section shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of Chapters 1.16 and 1.18 SBMC. (Ord. 478 § 2, 2017; Ord. 468 § 2, 2016)

17.62.010 Findings and declarations.

The city council of the city of Solana Beach hereby makes the following legislative findings and declarations: 

A. The beach and tidelands of the city are an important public resource. Preservation of an aesthetically pleasing shoreline area is important to protect the beach as a public resource and preserve its appeal as a recreational facility and tourist attraction. The purpose of this chapter is to create a regulatory framework which balances the protection of vested private property rights and important public interests in shoreline resources which can be harmed by the construction of coastal bluff protection measures. 

B. The shoreline of Solana Beach is characterized by a narrow strip of sandy beach at the foot of coastal bluffs. At the tops of these bluffs private residences and other structures have been built. Because of the narrowness of the beach and lack of a sand buffer, the bluffs are subjected to erosion from wave action, particularly during the winter months. Erosion has also resulted from irrigation practices, storm water drainage, construction activity, and climbing activities. Unless properly regulated, seawalls, revetments, bluff retaining walls, erosion control devices, rip rap, cave filling or plugging, and other similar shoreline and coastal bluff protection measures individually and cumulatively may adversely impact the shoreline. When permitted, such devices should be designed, constructed and maintained in a manner that has the least impact on the shoreline and public use of the beach while providing adequate protection to the bluff top structures and uses. 

C. The California Coastal Act contains provisions which allow the construction of seawalls, revetments, bluff retaining walls and other similar shoreline and coastal bluff protection measures when necessary to protect existing structures and when consequential damage to the shoreline can be minimized. [Public Resources Code Section 30235.] The scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas are considered a resource of public importance, therefore, the Coastal Act also contains policies which require that new development be located and designed to minimize the alteration of natural land forms and to be visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas. [Public Resources Code Section 30251.] Under the Coastal Act state and local governmental agencies and entities with power and authority to implement the Coastal Act are charged with the responsibility to resolve conflicts between policies of the Act in a manner which on balance is most protective of significant coastal resources. [Public Resources Sections 30007.5, 30200.] This chapter is intended to enact local coastal policies consistent with the provisions of the Act. In adopting this chapter the city council, in a manner consistent with the policies and goals of the Coastal Act, has attempted to balance the rights and privileges of private property owners to preserve, protect, develop and use property with the rights of the public to assure protection of important public resources and the need to assure that development designed to preserve or enhance one property does not adversely affect another property. 

D. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) has adopted a shoreline preservation strategy that establishes certain objectives and strategies for the preservation of coastal resources in the county of San Diego. The city council has considered the shoreline preservation strategy, adopted July 23, 1993, in the development of this chapter. In particular the city council finds that this chapter does the following things as recommended by the shoreline preservation strategy: minimizes construction on beaches and in front of seacliffs; protects property from storm waves, flooding and seacliff erosion by permitting, subject to regulation, certain types of shoreline defense structures; requires persons desiring to install shoreline defense structures to mitigate adverse impacts resulting from the construction including, without limitation, impacts on the environment, aesthetic impacts and impacts on the public’s use of the beach and other property subject to a public trust. Additionally, the city council finds that this chapter and other city ordinances and regulations address other shoreline preservation strategies by establishing setbacks from seacliffs and imposing blufftop erosion management measures such as irrigation controls, restrictions on grading of blufftops and seacliff faces and restrictions on drainage over blufftops and seacliff faces. The city council finds that these city ordinances and regulations constitute part of the city’s contribution to a cooperative, cost-effective regionwide shoreline management strategy; and that the city intends to continue working together with other local, state and federal governments and agencies to develop this strategy and to seek financial support for it.

E. Preservation and enhancement of the beach is an important city goal. During the preparation of the local coastal plan required pursuant to the California Coastal Act the city will develop and adopt policies, goals and implementation measures to preserve and enhance beach sand levels. The city will also support regional efforts to manage beach sand.

F. Regulating the use of seawalls, revetments, bluff retaining walls and other similar structures is consistent with the Solana Beach general plan. Safety element Policy 4.b discourages the use of seawalls. 

G. This chapter is not intended, and shall not be construed, to authorize the granting or denial of a permit in a manner which will take or damage private property for public use without payment of just compensation. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.020 Policy.

A. The safety element of the city’s general plan provides that the city shall discourage the use of seawalls. [Goal 3.2, Objective 4.0, Policy 4.b.] The open space and conservation element of the city’s general plan provides that the city shall require new developments to be subjected to visual impact analyses where potential impacts upon sensitive locations are identified, and further shall require that new structures and improvements be integrated with the surrounding environment to the greatest possible extent. [Goal 3.2, Objective 3.0, Policy 3.a., and 3.b.] Therefore, it is the policy of the city council of the city of Solana Beach to strictly regulate the construction of new seawalls, revetments, bluff retaining walls, gunite covering, metal or wood armoring and other similar shoreline defense structures. Such protection measures generally will not be allowed when other feasible shoreline or coastal bluff protection measures are available. Permits for the construction of seawalls, revetments, bluff retaining walls, gunite coverings, metal or wood armoring and other similar structures will be issued only when necessary to accomplish one of the following purposes:

1. To protect existing legally built structures on property when the structure or structures are threatened with imminent danger or destruction from bluff failure due to erosion and other methods of protecting the structure or structures are not feasible, and the benefit of protecting the structure as opposed to removing it outweighs the adverse impact resulting from the construction of the protective device; or

2. To preserve economically viable use of property, when it is demonstrated that without the proposed protection measure the property could not be used for any economically viable purpose and other methods of protecting or economic usefulness of the property are not feasible; or

3. To abate a public nuisance when other methods of abatement including, but not limited to, removal of a structure or improvement would result in a severe economic hardship to the owner of private property or the loss of a significant public benefit.

B. Shoreline protection measures such as seacave plugging and filling are preferred over the construction of seawalls, bluff retaining walls, gunite covering and similar permanent armoring. Permits for seacave plugging and filling will be expeditiously processed and will generally be permitted or conditionally permitted to be constructed in accordance with the design criteria of this chapter. Plugging and filling of caves is acceptable as a reasonable measure to prevent erosion and minimize effects that could result in a future need to construct a more intrusive protection device. 

C. Rip rap, sand bags, armoring, revetments and other temporary bluff protection measures shall be permitted only on a temporary basis to respond to an emergency.

D. It is the further policy of the city that applications for permits under this chapter be processed expeditiously to the extent such processing is consistent with the protection of the public interest and the preservation of private property. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.030 Coastal Act requirements.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify, repeal, or supersede any other law or regulation pertaining to work or development on a coastal bluff. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit or prevent any activity, development or work requiring the issuance of a coastal development permit but which is not subject to regulation pursuant to this chapter. The requirements of this chapter shall be met before issuance of a coastal development permit pursuant to the California Coastal Act. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.040 Definition of words and phrases.

F. The permit required by this chapter shall be in lieu of any permit required by SBMC 17.68.040(B); provided, however, that any development, structure or work on a coastal blufftop or seacliff which is not included within the scope of this chapter shall not, by reason of that noninclusion, be deemed to be exempt from the requirements of SBMC 17.68.040. 

G. The permit required by the chapter is additional to any permit required pursuant to the California Coastal Act. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.060 Permit – Application.

A. Application. In addition to the information required by Chapter 17.72 SBMC, the application for a special use permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall include the following information:

1. A detailed description of the bluff geology in the area where the structure is to be placed, prepared by a qualified licensed professional geologist, engineer or other licensed professional authorized by the state to perform professional engineering and experienced in coastal processes.

2. A detailed description of the alternatives to the proposed structure, prepared by a qualified licensed professional engineer or other licensed professional authorized by the state to perform professional engineering and experienced in coastal processes.

In addition, the report must demonstrate that the construction of the proposed shoreline defense structure will be effective in preserving the integrity of significant structures on the site or preserving an economically viable use of the property. The report must be prepared by a qualified licensed professional geologist, engineer or other licensed professional authorized by the state to perform professional engineering and experienced in coastal processes. An independent analysis of all geotechnical reports submitted pursuant to this chapter shall be prepared by a geologic consultant hired by the city, the cost of which shall be paid for by the applicant.

a. Special Provision Relating to Applications for Plugging and Filling. In lieu of the information required by subsection (A)(4) of this section, an applicant for a seacave plug or fill may submit a report showing the necessity for plugging or filling. The report must also demonstrate the effectiveness of plugging or filling. The report must be prepared by a qualified licensed professional geologist, engineer or other licensed professional authorized by the state to perform professional engineering and experienced in coastal processes. 

B. Approval of Form and Completeness of Application Information.

1. The application information shall be presented in a form acceptable to the city engineer and planning director. The city engineer and planning director shall have 30 days following submission of the information to approve or disapprove the form and completeness of the information presented. 

2. In order to expeditiously process permits, at the applicant’s discretion with the consent of the city engineer and planning director, the application information may be provided by way of an environmental impact report, initial study, expanded initial study, or other appropriate environmental review document. 

C. Application Deemed Acceptable for Processing – Circumstances. If the city engineer and planning director do not respond within the 30-day period the information shall be deemed acceptable for processing. 

D. Planning Director Authorized to Establish a List of Qualified Professionals. The planning director may establish a list of qualified professionals meeting the requirements of this section and may establish procedures for establishing such a list. (Ord. 295 § 1, 2003; Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.070 Application fee. 

A. Basic Application Fee. Each application for a special use permit for a shoreline defense structure shall be accompanied by an application fee established by resolution of the city council. No application shall be accepted or shall be deemed accepted until the application fee has been paid. The application fee may be different for the various types of shoreline and coastal bluff protection measures. 

B. Deposit for Additional Costs. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible to pay all costs incurred by the city for professional services determined by the planning director or city engineer to be needed to assist in the review or processing of the application, or for extraordinary costs. When the planning director determines that the processing of an application will result in need for professional services, or result in extraordinary costs not included in the basic application fee, the planning director shall provide the applicant with a statement of expected costs. The applicant shall promptly place on deposit, subject to refund or additional collection, funds in the amount of the expected costs. The planning director shall not process an application until appropriate deposits have been made. At the conclusion of the application process, the planning director shall promptly prepare a refund of unexpended deposits. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.080 Issuance and denial.

A. Permits for Seawalls, Revetments and Bluff Retaining Walls. A special use permit for a seawall, bluff retaining wall, armoring or revetment may be issued only if the city council finds all of the following:

1. a. An existing significant structure is threatened with imminent danger or destruction because of bluff erosion which occurs naturally, or which results or arises from circumstances which are not within the control of the property owner, and it is reasonably foreseeable that without the shoreline defense structure the threatened structure on the site will suffer structural damage; or 

b. The shoreline defense structure is necessary to abate a public nuisance existing on the property that cannot be reasonably abated in another manner; or 

c. Unless the shoreline defense structure is permitted the property will be unable to be used for any economically viable use permitted by the city’s general plan and applicable zoning. 

For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(a), structural damage means a noticeable or measurable amount of structural damage directly related to the bluff condition to be mitigated but does not include construction defects or damage to a structure caused by weather or earthquake. For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b), removal of a structure, other than a significant structure, shall be considered a reasonable method for abatement of a public nuisance.

2. No other reasonably feasible method of stabilizing the coastal bluff will protect the existing structure, abate the nuisance or preserve the economically viable use of the property. 

3. The property owner has taken reasonable steps to protect the property and significant structures by other means. 

4. The owner or prior owners did not create the necessity for the shoreline defense structure by unreasonably failing to implement generally accepted erosion and drainage control measures or by otherwise unreasonably acting or failing to act with respect to the property. The provisions of this subsection (A)(4) shall not apply to a bona fide purchaser who acquired the property without knowledge of the condition resulting in the necessity for construction of the shoreline protection device.

5. To the extent the location, size, design and operation characteristics of the proposed shoreline defense structure adversely affect adjacent public or private property, natural resources, or public use of the beach, mitigation shall be provided to the extent deemed feasible with a statement of overriding considerations issued to the extent said impacts are not fully mitigated.

6. The proposed shoreline defense structure will be:

a. The minimum measure necessary to provide a reasonable level of protection; and

b. Constructed and maintained to incorporate an earth-like appearance which will resemble as closely as possible the natural color and texture of the adjacent bluffs; and

c. Constructed and maintained to reasonably conform to the natural form of the bluff; and 

d. Placed at the most feasible landward location; and 

e. Appropriately landscaped and maintained to blend in with the existing environment.

7. The shoreline defense structure will be located entirely on private property or, if the structure will be located partially or entirely on public property or property subject to a public trust all required permits for construction or real property interests have been obtained, or will be obtained, from the appropriate public agency or agencies with jurisdiction and/or ownership. 

8. The construction of the structure and reconstruction of the bluff face, if any, will not result in a usable area at the top of the bluff larger than existed on January 3, 1991 or extend the bluff-top edge seaward more than 10 feet from the bluff-top edge as it existed on January 3, 1991 as shown on the orthophoto map of the city dated January 3, 1991 and on file in the planning department.

9. The project as approved or conditionally approved will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare and will not unreasonably affect the public use of the beach. Encroachments into the public beach shall be mitigated to the satisfaction of the city council.

B. Other Types of Work. A special use permit for any other erosion control measure, bluff repair or work on the coastal bluff not otherwise addressed in subsection A of this section, or in SBMC 17.62.100, shall be denied unless the city council finds that the measure is:

1. A necessary preventative measure to stop or control erosion of the bluff; and

2. The measure will not adversely affect the bluff. (Ord. 351 § 1, 2007; Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.090 City council decisions. 

The city council shall render any decision it makes under SBMC 17.62.080 or 17.62.100 by resolution. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.100 Permits to plug or fill seacaves.

A special use permit for the plugging or filling of a seacave may be issued only if the planning director or city council on appeal finds:

A. Plugging or filling a seacave is:

1. A necessary preventative measure to stop erosion from enlarging the cave, crack, fissure, joint, or fault which if enlarged would eventually threaten the stability of the bluff; or

2. Necessary to protect structures on top of the bluff threatened by the collapse of a cave large enough to impair bluff stability; or

3. Necessary to eliminate an actual public nuisance including, without limitation, an attractive nuisance. 

B. The plug is designed with a “leaner” cement mix on the external facade and a “stronger/greater” mix internally to facilitate plug erosion to match the rate of natural erosion of the adjacent coastal bluff. The external facade will resemble as closely as possible the natural color and texture of the adjacent bluffs and be of sufficient depth to replicate the retreat of the adjacent bluff due to weathering anticipated to be experienced over the next 75 years.

C. The project as approved or conditionally approved will not adversely affect adjacent public or private property and will not unreasonably affect the public use of the beach. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.110 Temporary emergency permits.

A. In the event of an emergency, the following remedial, protective or preventive shoreline and coastal bluff protection measures may be allowed only on a temporary basis subject to issuance of a temporary emergency special use permit:

1. Rip rap as defined by this chapter.

2. Sand bags or other sand filled devices.

3. Temporary wood or metal shoring. 

B. A temporary emergency special use permit shall be approved or conditionally approved only if the planning director finds the following:

1. That an emergency exists as defined by this chapter.

2. That without an emergency shoreline defense structure or other coastal bluff protection measure, substantial damage to or loss of life or property is imminently probable.

3. The shoreline defense structure will be located entirely on private property or, if the structure will be located partially or entirely on public property or property subject to a public trust all required permits for construction or real property interests have been obtained, or will be obtained, from the appropriate public agency or agencies with jurisdiction and/or ownership.

4. The project as approved or conditionally approved will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare and will not unreasonably affect public use of the beach. 

C. Any temporary emergency structure, device or other measure shall be removed 180 days after its construction or installation. The time period for removal of a temporary emergency structure may be extended by the planning director, if the planning director finds that the property owner has applied for and is diligently pursuing a special use permit for a permanent protection structure or device, or has obtained such a permit and is diligently pursuing the construction or installation of the permitted permanent structure or device. In addition, the planning director may extend the time for removal of a temporary emergency structure or measure for periods of 90 days if the director finds that the grounds for initial approval of the temporary emergency special use permit continue to exist and the property owner needs additional time to submit and pursue an application for a permanent protection structure, device or measure. An application for a time extension, along with a statement of justification, shall be submitted to the planning director not less than 30 days before the expiration date.

D. Prior to commencement of construction under a temporary emergency special use permit, or within 15 days thereof if allowed by the planning director, the permittee shall provide a security in the form of a faithful performance bond, letter of credit or other security instrument approved by the planning director and city attorney, in an amount determined by the city engineer, to secure removal of the temporary structure as required by this section. (Ord. 245 § 1, 1998; Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.120 Planning director decisions – Time limits – Appeal.

A. The planning director shall render a decision pursuant to SBMC 17.62.100 or 17.62.110 in writing. The decision shall be posted on a public bulletin board at City Hall and shall be mailed to the applicant and to the owners or occupants of all property located within 300 feet of the site of the proposed work. 

B. A decision on an application for a special use permit under SBMC 17.62.100 shall be rendered within 30 days from the date when the application is determined or deemed to be complete. A decision on an application for a temporary emergency permit under SBMC 17.62.110 shall be rendered within 10 business days from the date of submission of the application.

C. Any interested party, including any member of the city council, may appeal the decision of the planning director to the city council by filing a written appeal with the city clerk within five business days following the date of posting the decision. Except when the appeal is brought by a member of the city council, or by the California Coastal Commission or State Lands Commission or other public agency, the appeal shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount established by city council resolution. The city council shall hear and decide the appeal after a public hearing held at the first regularly scheduled city council meeting which is at least 15 calendar days following the filing date of the appeal. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.130 Costs.

The costs of installation, maintenance, replacement, removal and relocation of any shoreline defense structure shall be at the sole expense of the permittee or any subsequent owner. Upon removal of any shoreline device, the permittee or owner shall, at his or her sole expense, cause the surrounding area to be repaired and restored to a condition resembling as closely as possible the natural bluff terrain existing at that time. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.140 Maintenance and repair of defense structures.

A. The owner or any subsequent owner of the property on which a shoreline defense structure is located shall have the continuing obligation to do all of the following:

1. Maintain the structure and the recontoured bluff in good repair;

2. To remove debris that is deposited on the beach or in the water during construction of the structure or as a result of its erosion or failure afterward;

3. To immediately remove graffiti or other markings or any other unsightly vandalism should it appear on the project face of the structure;

 4. To abide by all terms and conditions of the permit.

B. If the owner or subsequent owner of the property fails to perform the requirements of any subparagraph of subsection A, the city can, after 30 days prior written notice to the owner, perform any work and impose the cost of such work as a lien on the property.

C. The planning director may authorize minor work to repair any legally existing shoreline defense structure or the bluff area immediately adjoining the structure; provided, that: 

1. The repair work does not extend the height of the structure by more than one foot or the width of the structure by more than three feet;

2. The repair work does not substantially alter the appearance of the structure;

3. A building permit is obtained before any structural work requiring such a permit is commenced;

4. The structure’s surface will be modified to incorporate an earth-like appearance which will resemble as closely as possible the natural color and texture or the adjacent bluffs. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.150 Use of city beach and other public property during construction.

The permittee may use the beach or other city property for access for permitted construction, repair or maintenance of a permanent or temporary shoreline defense structure. Such use shall be subject to the provisions of this code relating to use of or encroachments on city property, applicable conditions of approval of the special use permit, and adopted regulations or policies relating to beach use and activities. The permittee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the state of California and the city and each of their respective agencies, officers and employees from any and all liability resulting from the use of the public beach or other city property under this section, and in this regard the provisions of SBMC 11.20.030 shall apply. The permittee shall pay to the city all applicable fees and deposits for use of the beach or other city property prior to commencement of construction or maintenance and all city staff or contract service to monitor and/or regulate construction activities. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.160 Landscaping, irrigation, and drainage.

A. Landscaping of lots located between the coastal bluff and the first public street shall conform to landscaping standards prepared by the planning director and approved by city council resolution. The landscaping standards shall encourage the use of native vegetation that thrives on seasonal rain and natural coastal moisture, and requires minimum watering. Lawns and similar ground cover may also be permitted subject to strict watering requirements. The landscaping standards shall discourage work on the bluff face. In developing the landscaping standards, the city shall provide a process where owners can maintain existing mature landscaping using watering techniques approved by a licensed landscape architect and determined by the city engineer to not create risk to bluff stability. 

B. Automatic irrigation systems shall be prohibited within 100 feet of the coastal bluff unless the systems incorporate automatic shut-off valves and moisture sensors. Retrofitting with drip, mist and other very low flow irrigation devices of irrigation systems on the bluff or within 25 feet of the bluff top edge may be reasonable steps a property owner may take to minimize potential adverse impacts to the bluff. 

C. Lots located between the coastal bluff and the first public street shall have drainage systems that convey surface drainage away from the bluff edge. Drainage over the bluff edge or through the bluff shall be prohibited unless the water is contained within a pipe drainage system approved by the city engineer. Installation of a drainage system that conveys surface and subsurface water away from the coastal bluff and to the public street or to an approved pipe drainage system is a reasonable step a property owner may take to minimize bluff erosion. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.170 Violations.

A. Any violation of this chapter is a misdemeanor punishable pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1.16 SBMC.

B. Any shoreline defense structure, or part thereof, constructed or maintained in violation of this chapter is a public nuisance.

C. Any person who constructs, repairs or maintains, or directs the construction, repair or maintenance, of a shoreline defense structure, or part thereof, in violation of this chapter is subject to a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000 per day for each day that the violation exists.

D.  In addition to the provisions of this section, the provisions of Chapter 1.16 SBMC shall apply to violations of this chapter. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


17.62.180 Severability – Supplemental provisions. 

If any provision of this chapter as herein enacted or hereafter amended, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or applications of this chapter (or any section or portion of section hereof) which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are, and are intended to be, severable. 

The provisions of this chapter are intended to augment and be in addition to other provisions of the Solana Beach Municipal Code. Whenever the provisions of this chapter impose a greater restriction upon persons, premises, or practices than are imposed by other provisions of the Solana Beach Municipal Code or the California Coastal Act, the provisions of this chapter shall control.

If any sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the decision shall not affect the remaining provisions of this chapter. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed the ordinance codified in this chapter, and each sentence, clause, and phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. (Ord. 195 § 1, 1994)


Chapter 17.63 VIEW ASSESSMENT

Sections:

17.63.010    Purpose and intent.

17.63.020    Definitions.

17.63.030    Application of zoning regulations.

17.63.040    Procedures and requirements for structure development permits.

17.63.050    Exemptions.

17.63.060    Expiration of permits.


17.63.010 Purpose and intent. 

The hillsides, canyons, and natural geographic features of the city of Solana Beach constitute a limited natural resource in their scenic value to all city residents and visitors. These unique features have also led to a development pattern whereby vista points and views from lots have been created. The community character and property values will be adversely affected if the impact of new construction on existing viewsheds is not assessed and regulated. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this chapter:

A. To provide a process for the view assessment committee to review all feasible solutions for development and choose that alternative which provides the best balance between the owner’s desire to develop his/her property in accordance with applicable regulations and the neighbor’s desire to protect his/her view. This chapter does not create a right to an unobstructed view.

B. To preserve the existing character of established residential neighborhoods, and the desire to protect, where feasible, public and private views, aesthetics, and other property values in a manner which is compatible with reasonable development of property.

C. To implement those sections of the general plan land use element which call for the adoption of ordinances to encourage the preservation of private views where feasible.

D. To promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by preventing the needless destruction and impairment of these limited, unique, and irreplaceable views for this and future generations.

E. To provide a public notification process to encourage the resolution of view impairment issues by those property owners directly affected without further involvement of the city. (Ord. 201 § 1, 1994)


17.63.020 Definitions. 

For purposes of this chapter the following words, phrases and terms shall have the following meanings:

A. “Building setback” means the minimum distance as prescribed by this title between any property line, or private easement boundary used for vehicular and/or pedestrian access, and the closest point on any building or structure above ground level on the property.

B. “Lot coverage” means that portion of a lot or building site which is occupied by any building or structure.

C. “Neighborhood character” means the existing characteristics of a neighborhood in terms of the following:

1. Scale of residences in the vicinity of the subject property;

2. Style of residences in the vicinity of the subject property;

3. Building setbacks to other property in the same zone.

D. “Owner” means the person who has submitted an application for a structure development permit.

E. “Privacy” means reasonable protection from intrusive visual observation and/or noise.

F. “Scale” means the total square footage, apparent bulk and lot coverage of a residence and accessory structures.

G. “Structure” shall mean anything constructed or built, any edifice or building of any kind, or any piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner, which is located on or on top of the ground, and exceeding seven feet in height.

H. “Style” shall mean design elements which consist of the following:

1. Height of structure;

2. Open space between structures;

3. Roof shape;

4. The mass of the structure;

5. Number of stories.

I. “Viewing area” shall be that area of the structure (excluding bathrooms, hallways, garages or closets) or lot (excluding the building setback areas) where the view assessment committee, or the city council on appeal, determines the best and most important view exists. The finished floor elevation of any viewing area must be at or above existing grade adjacent to the exterior wall of the part of the building nearest to that viewing area. The determination shall be made by balancing the nature of the view to be protected and the importance of the area of the structure or lot from where the view is taken. 

J. “View assessment commission” shall be a commission of seven persons appointed by the city council and vested with authority to administer this chapter. The terms and qualification for service on the commission are established in Chapter 2.74 SBMC and the general provisions for the commission are established in Chapter 2.60 SBMC. The commission shall consist of resident members who are also property owners within the city of Solana Beach. The community development director or the community development director’s designee shall be an ex officio member of the commission. The city council adopted “guidelines and toolkit” shall be applied to assist in the implementation of this chapter and shall be binding on the view assessment commission. 

K. All other terms of this commission that are not covered in this section shall be referenced in Chapter 2.60 SBMC. (Ord. 370 § 1, 2008; Ord. 201 § 1, 1994)


17.63.030 Application of zoning regulations.

Building height, building coverage, and building setback regulations for all zones shall be as set forth in the applicable provisions of this title, subject to specific design modifications as determined necessary by the view assessment committee or the city council on appeal to achieve the purpose and intent of this chapter. The city council adopted “guidelines and toolkit” shall be utilized in conjunction with this chapter. (Ord. 201 § 1, 1994)


17.63.040 Procedures and requirements for structure development permits.

A. Application for Structure Development Permit. Any owner proposing to construct a new structure, or an addition to an existing structure, exceeding a height of 16 feet above existing grade, shall be required to submit an application for a structure development permit to the city. The application shall be in a form established by the community development director and shall contain sufficient information and plans to permit review pursuant to this chapter, including a complete set of preliminary plans, a site plan and all exterior elevations. The applicant (sometimes called “owner” in this chapter) shall also submit a current property owner list, postage, and one set of mailing labels for all property owners and occupants within 300 feet of the subject property or for the nearest 20 properties, whichever is greater. An application processing fee in an amount established by city council resolution shall be paid at the time of submission of the application. In the case of very minor additions to existing structures, the community development director has the authority to determine whether or not a structure development permit is required. The community development director also has the authority to waive the requirement, established by subsection B of this section, to erect story poles as a part of the application for a structure development permit for projects where there is no likelihood of a view impairment; provided, however, that if an application for review of the project is filed, the view assessment committee may require that story poles be erected. When a project requires both a city council discretionary permit under the applicable provisions of this title and a structure development permit under this chapter, the applications shall be consolidated and the matter heard by the city council according to the procedures established elsewhere in this title.   An application for view assessment under subsection E of this section is required for a hearing on a consolidated application. Notice of the review period will be mailed by city staff in accordance with the above requirements and applications for view assessment must be reviewed within 30 days in accordance with subsection E of this section. The city council shall decide the consolidated application based on the standards of both the zoning ordinance and this chapter. Prior to the city council hearing, staff shall refer the consolidated application to the view assessment committee for a report, which report shall be filed within 60 days.

B. Roofline “Story” Poles. Unless waived by the community development director pursuant to subsection A of this section, as a part of the application for a structure development permit including permits consolidated with a city council discretionary permit, the applicant shall erect, or cause to be erected, temporary poles connected with string marked with colored pennants sufficient to show the height and general outline of the proposed structure. If the community development director has waived the requirement for story poles, the view assessment committee may require the poles upon a determination by the committee that the poles will aid in making the required determinations under this chapter. The accuracy of the structural outline established by the story poles shall be verified by a signed statement of a licensed land surveyor on a story pole plot plan. Conformance of the structure, as approved or conditionally approved, to the structural outline established by the story poles, or by the conditionally approved structure development permit if different, shall be verified before final inspection of the framing by a licensed land surveyor.

C. Mediation. At the time that an application for a structure development permit is filed the applicant may make an offer in writing to submit the matters of any view impairment to mediation by a private independent mediator. When a person accepts an owner’s offer to submit a matter to mediation, or when the owner accepts an offer to mediate made by a person whose view may be impaired, either party to the mediation shall notify the community development director that the matter will be submitted to mediation and all time periods for action by the community development director or the view assessment committee shall be stayed until the owner notifies the community development director in writing that mediation has been concluded. If the matter of view impairment is successfully mediated, the owner shall submit revised plans showing any revisions agreed to during the mediation process along with a written statement of the mediator that the matter has been successfully mediated. If the matter is successfully mediated, the community development director shall refund the application fee paid by the owner, unless the proposed project also requires a city council discretionary permit under the zoning ordinance in which case the portion of the fee which is attributable to the view review process shall be refunded. If more than one person from more than one property have accepted an owner’s offer to mediate or have voluntarily offered to submit the matter of a view impairment to mediation, the amount of the owner’s application fee refunded for a successful mediation shall be proportional to the number of successfully resolved disputes. Further, if the matter is successfully mediated, the community development director shall refund to any person who has filed a request for view assessment, and with whom the owner has successfully mediated, the fee for filing the application for view assessment. If the matter is not successfully mediated, the conclusions of the mediator shall not be submitted to, or considered by, the view assessment committee. It is the intention of the city council that mediation be used to resolve view impairment issues whenever feasible. To that end, the community development director is authorized to keep a list of private mediators for reference. Any person who is qualified to act as a professional mediator and requests to be included on the list of mediators shall be included on the list. The cost of mediation shall be borne by the parties according to the usual practices of the mediator. The city council further finds that the refund of application fees to persons who successfully mediate disputes through private mediation serves the public interest by encouraging mediation and by reducing the staff time necessary to review and process applications.

D. Notice. Except where the community development director determines a project to be exempt from the permit requirement, the city shall mail written notice to all property owners and occupants within a 300-foot radius of the subject site or the nearest 20 property owners, whichever is greater, of the pending application. Notice shall not be given until roofline, “story” poles have been erected. Only one notice (addressed to the homeowners’ association) shall be required for all properties within a condominium subdivision. Notice shall be deemed given on the date of mailing of the notice. The notice shall include all of the following:

1. A brief description of the structure;

2. A statement that the application and plans for the structure are available for public review in the planning department office;

3. A statement that residents who believe that their views may be impaired by the structure are encouraged to contact the subject property owner directly to work out a mutually acceptable solution;

4. A statement informing all property owners of their right to file an application for view assessment within 30 days of the date of the notice; and

5. If the owner has made an offer to submit the matter to mediation, the fact of that offer.

E. Application for View Assessment. Any person who owns or has lawful possession of a residence from which a view may be impaired by the proposed structure, or in the case of an impact to a public view, any person who owns or has lawful possession of a residence in the city or the community development director, may, within 30 days of the date of notice, file an application for view assessment. The application shall include a description of the “viewing area” as defined in this chapter and the extent of impairment. An application processing fee in an amount established by city council resolution for applications involving impacts to a residence (but there shall not be a fee for applications based on impacts to public views) shall be paid at the time of submission of the application. If an application for view assessment is filed, all issues in dispute including, if necessary, the determination of a viewing area, shall be resolved by the view assessment committee. The view assessment committee shall hold a public meeting not more than 30 days after the last date for filing an application for view assessment. All applications for view assessment with respect to a proposed project shall be heard at the same hearing. Unless the applicant for the permit consents to a longer time period, the view assessment committee shall render its decision within 30 days following the first meeting on the application. If during the view assessment committee meeting the project is redesigned to extend outside the originally proposed three-dimensional building envelope, the meeting shall be continued and the new design renoticed in conformance with subsection D. The decision of the view assessment committee shall be incorporated as a condition of the structure development permit and any other discretionary permits required for the proposed structure. Written notice of the view assessment committee’s decision shall be sent to the owner and all parties who filed for view assessment.

If no application for view assessment is filed within 30 days of the original date of notice, all rights to review are waived and the community development director shall grant the structure development permit unless any other city council discretionary permit is required by this title or the application does not comply with other applicable zoning or building laws.

F. Findings. In making a decision on a matter for which view assessment has been requested, the view assessment committee shall be required to make the following findings:

1. The applicant for the structure development permit has made a reasonable attempt to resolve the view impairment issues with the person(s) requesting view assessment. Written evidence of a good faith voluntary offer to meet and discuss view issues, or of a good faith voluntary offer to submit the matter to mediation, is hereby deemed to be a reasonable attempt to resolve the view impairment issues.

2. The proposed structure does not significantly impair a view from public property (parks, major thoroughfares, bike ways, walkways, equestrian trails) which has been identified in the city’s general plan, local coastal program, or city designated viewing areas.

3. The structure is designed and situated in such a manner as to minimize impairment of views.

4. There is no significant cumulative view impairment caused by granting the application. Cumulative view impairment shall be determined by: (a) Considering the amount of view impairment caused by the proposed structure; and (b) considering the amount of view impairment that would be caused by the construction on other parcels of structures similar to the proposed structure.

5. The proposed structure is compatible with the immediate neighborhood character.

G. Appeals. The decision of the view assessment committee may be appealed to the city council by the owner or the person(s) who requested the view assessment only after written documentation that interested parties participated in mediation or some other nonbinding form of alternative dispute resolution. Subsection C of this section authorizes the community development director to keep a list of private mediators for reference. The cost of mediation shall be borne by the participants according to the usual practices of the mediator. Mediation must be requested in writing within 10 days of the date of notice of the decision of the view assessment committee with a copy of the written request also shared with the community development director. If upon completion of mediation, the dispute has not been resolved, only those parties who participated in the mediation may file an appeal of the view assessment committee decision. The decision of the mediator will be reviewed by the community development director to confirm that the mediated agreement is consistent with all provisions of the SBMC. If the mediated agreement meets the SBMC standards, the city council shall adopt a resolution of approval. If the mediated decision does not meet SBMC standards, it shall be returned to the mediator. If the mediator provides a written statement that the parties were unable to resolve the issues, then an appeal may be filed in accordance with the following provisions:

1. A notice of appeal must be filed in writing with the community development director (a) within but no later than 10 days after the date of a written decision by a mediator following confirmation by the community development director that the decision is final, or (b) within 10 days of written notification that mediation has not been successful, or (c) within 60 days of the date of the decision of the view assessment committee. The 60-day period may be extended if progress is being made through mediation and all parties in mediation agree to the extension. If mediation has been successful and the decision becomes final, then no appeal is necessary. Assuming the design, conditions and standards associated with the mediation project meet all city standards, the community development director will prepare a resolution for city council approval on the consent calendar. The notice of appeal shall contain a statement of the grounds for the appeal. The community development director shall mail the notice of appeal to all persons who submitted oral or written testimony to the view assessment committee at the hearing on the project. The appellant shall pay the cost of the mailing.

2. At the time of filing a notice of appeal, an appeal fee to cover the cost of the appeal in an amount established by city council resolution shall be paid to the extent that payment is required by the city council resolution establishing the fee.

3. Within 10 days following the filing of a notice of appeal the appellant shall file with the community development director a statement on appeal which includes: (a) the grounds for the appeal; (b) a summary of the evidence presented to the view assessment committee; (c) a summary of the evidence presented during mediation as well as any written conclusions from the mediator; and (d) any argument the appellant wishes to make supporting the appeal. Upon receipt of the statement, the community development director shall make the statement available as a public record.

4. At a subsequent city council meeting which is more than 10 days after the filing of the appellant’s statement on appeal, the city council shall conduct a hearing on the appeal.

5. Notice of the hearing on appeal shall be mailed 10 days prior to the hearing to the appellant(s), to the owner, to all persons who requested view preservation review and to all persons who appeared at the view assessment committee meeting or submitted comments for consideration by the view assessment committee. The determination of the city council on appeal includes a consideration of the following matters: (a) the issues submitted to the view assessment committee and identified in the notice of appeal; (b) the evidence presented to the committee at the hearing on the matter and any additional evidence which the city council finds could not reasonably have been submitted to the view assessment committee; (c) the resolution of the view assessment committee; (d) a transcript of the hearing before the committee if one has been prepared by the appellant(s) or other person and presented to the city council for its consideration; (e) written statements by persons authorized to appear at the public hearing; and (f) oral presentations by persons appearing at the public hearing. The city council shall permit any person who appeared at the committee hearing or who submitted written comments to the committee to be heard at the hearing on appeal and may permit any other person to be heard. The city council may exercise its independent judgment as to the matter, but shall not overturn the decision of the committee except on the affirmative vote of three members of the city council. The decision of the city council is final. (Ord. 329 § 1, 2004; Ord. 317 § 1, 2003; Ord. 312, 2003; Ord. 288 § 1, 2002; Ord. 201 § 1, 1994)

17.64.010 Purpose and intent. 

A. It is the intent of these provisions to establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of all signs within the city. 

The city recognizes the need of signs to identify businesses and property within the community. The city also recognizes that signing is an important design element of the physical environment which serves to express both the owner of a sign and the community. Regulations consistent with community goals and objectives are necessary to ensure both individual expression and an attractive community character. 

It is the purpose of these regulations to enhance the aesthetic nature of the community by eliminating visual clutter, while permitting effective communication by owners and occupants of property. In so doing, it is anticipated that these regulations will contribute to the economic stability of the city and its overall attractiveness to residents, visitors and businesses. 

B. Specifically, the purposes of these regulations are to: 

1. Protect the general public health, safety and welfare of the community; 

2. Reduce possible traffic and safety hazards through reduced sign clutter, and elimination of unauthorized signs in the public right-of-way; 

3. Maximize public convenience through appropriate identification and directional signs; 

4. Minimize the visual and lighting impacts of business signs to adjacent residential neighborhoods; 

5. Encourage signs and graphics which are well designed, aesthetically pleasing and appropriate to their intended context; 

6. Ensure that permitted signs contribute to a high quality visual environment constituent with community values; 

7. Protect and enhance the visual quality of designated scenic highways and other areas located within the scenic area overlay zone; and 

8. Enhance the economic value of the community. (Ord. 140 § 1, 1991)

A comprehensive sign plan shall be prepared and submitted by March 1, 1995, for all commercial, office, industrial and civic uses consisting of four or more tenant or occupant spaces on a premises or lot or two or more lots subject to a common development permit or plan. Unless the comprehensive sign plan is approved by the decision making body at the time of approval or conditional approval of the development permit or plan for the property, the authority to approve, conditionally approve or deny shall be vested in the community development director. This section shall not be interpreted to allow signage to remain beyond deadlines otherwise established by this section. A comprehensive sign plan shall not be approved unless it is consistent with this chapter, the underlying zoning regulations applicable to the property and any discretionary development permit or plan for the property. An approved comprehensive sign plan may be amended by the community development director upon application by the property owner or the owner’s agent. The director’s decision with respect to approval, conditional approval or denial of a comprehensive sign plan may be appealed by any interested person to the city council within 15 days of the date of the director’s action. The purpose of the plan is to coordinate graphics and signs with building and landscaping design. This coordination shall be achieved by: 

A. Using a coordinated palette of colors for sign lettering; 

B. Using the same type of cabinet supports, or method of mounting for signs of the same types, or by using the same type of construction material for components, such as sign copy, cabinet and supports, or by using other types of integrating techniques determined appropriate by the community development director; 

C. Using the same form of illumination for all signs, or by using varied forms of illuminations determined compatible by the community development director;

The following design standards shall be used in reviewing signs and sign plans for consistency with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 

A. Items of Information. 

1. Items of information should be limited to reduce sign clutter and ensure sign legibility. 

2. Items of information shall include: words, initials, logos, abbreviations, groups of numbers, symbols, pictures, photographs, emblems or geometric shapes. Signs combining several different geometric or nongeometric shapes of unusual configuration shall be assessed one additional item of information for each such shape or noncontinuous plane. 

B. Relationship to Buildings. 



1. Signs located upon a lot with only one main building shall be designed to be compatible with the predominant visual elements of the building. Such visual elements include architectural style, construction materials, color and other design details. 

2. Signs located upon a lot with more than one main building, such as a shopping center or other commercial or industrial area developed in accordance with a common development plan, shall be designed to be compatible with the predominant visual design elements common to all such buildings. 

C. Relationship to Other Signs. Where more than one freestanding monument sign is to be located on a lot, all such signs shall have designs which are complementary to each other by either identical or similar treatment of two or more of the following design elements: 

1. Type of construction materials for sign and support structures; 

2. Style of letters; 

3. Background color of sign; 

4. Shape of entire sign and its several components. 

D. Landscaping. Freestanding monument signs shall be located in a planted landscaped area which is of a shape, design and size that will provide a compatible setting and ground definition to the sign. The planted landscaped area shall be maintained in a neat and healthy condition. 

E. Illumination. Illumination, if any, shall be provided by artificial light which is constant in intensity and color. External illumination of freestanding monument signs is encouraged. Internally illuminated “can signs” are acceptable; provided background and copy are coordinated to avoid excessive light output. Neon transformers shall be limited to 30 milliamperes and fluorescent transformers shall be limited to 425 milliamperes to soften light output. Additionally, neon signs with exposed tubing shall be equipped with dimmers. 

F. Compatibility with Residential Areas. Signs located on commercial, office and industrial use properties adjacent to residential areas or civic use properties within residential areas shall be designed to minimize visual impacts upon adjacent residential neighborhoods. Potential impacts to designated “dark sky” areas shall be considered in the review of all illuminated signs. 

G. Relationship to Street. 

1. Signs shall be designed so as not to obstruct right-of-way views for pedestrians, bicyclists or automobile drivers; 

2. Deviations from the design review standard set forth in this section may be granted by the director of community development, or city council on an appeal; provided, that a finding can be made that the sign or sign plan is consistent with the regulations of this chapter and the general purpose and intent of this chapter. The director of community development, or city council on an appeal, may add to a sign permit any specific conditions determined necessary to ensure that the sign or sign plan is consistent with the general purpose and intent of this chapter.

An application processing fee in an amount established by city council resolution shall be paid at the time of submission of the application.

2. Within 30 working days after receipt of all required materials of the sign application, the director of community development or a designated representative shall render a decision to approve, approve with modification or deny the sign request. If no decision is rendered within 30 working days the sign permit shall be deemed denied.

B. Appeals. The decision of the director of community development to deny a permit may be appealed to the city council within 10 days of notice to the applicant of the decision. The applicant shall pay a fee to cover the cost of the appeals as established by the city council. Notice of the public hearing shall be mailed within 10 days prior to the hearing to all property owners within 300 feet of the structure in question as well as to any other property owners previously noticed or determined by the city council to be affected by the proposal. If no appeal is received the decision of the director of community development is final. (Ord. 140 § 1, 1991) 


17.64.150 Nonconforming signs. 

A. The eventual elimination of existing signs that are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter is as important as the regulation of new signs.

2. It lessens the degree of nonconformity of the signs on the site. 

D. A nonconforming sign which advertises, identifies or otherwise relates to a use on a property shall be removed if the use which the sign advertises identifies or relates to ceases for a period of three months or more. (Ord. 155 § 3, 1992; Ord. 140 § 1, 1991) 


17.64.160 Abatement requirements. 

A. Scope of Abatement Requirements. Every sign which does not comply with the provisions of this chapter shall be abated in accordance with this section. Unless otherwise provided herein, time periods for calculating abatement of nonconforming signs shall commence upon the effective date of the ordinance adopting this chapter.

Such abatement period shall commence upon the effective date of the amendment or annexation. 

B. Abatement Schedule. 

1. Illegal or Abandoned Signs or Advertising Structures.

3. Signs for Which the Amortization Period was Established Under a Prior Ordinance. 

a. Any sign, other than billboards, which was unlawful or nonconforming by any prior ordinance (including without limitation any sign regulations, scenic overlay zone ordinance or coastal zone ordinance) of the county of San Diego or of the city adopting or incorporating by reference any ordinance or code of the county of San Diego, and which was required by any applicable ordinance to be abated, or for which an amortization period was established, regardless of whether action was taken to enforce the abatement requirement or the amortization period, or whether an order of abatement was made, shall be removed or otherwise brought into conformance with the requirements of this chapter, without compensation to the owner, not later than December 1, 1996, unless the amortization period, if any, established by the prior ordinance which made the sign unlawful or created the nonconformity has not yet expired, in which event the sign shall be removed or otherwise brought into full compliance with this chapter, without compensation to the owner, upon the expiration of that previously established amortization period. In order to implement the requirements of this section, the code enforcement officer may prepare an inventory of nonconforming signs and give notice to the owner of such a sign, or to the property owner if the sign owner is not known, of the requirements of this subsection. The inventory of nonconforming signs prepared by the code enforcement officer may be based on any previous inventory prepared by the county of San Diego or by any other person. 

b. Billboards and other off-premises advertising structures which were made unlawful and nonconforming by any prior ordinance (including without limitation any ordinance of the county of San Diego or of this city) are illegal.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the signs or sign features listed in subdivision 2 of this subsection B, which signs or sign features shall be abated within 30 days from the effective date of the ordinance adopting this chapter. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a sign which is located in the public right-of-way or which is or may become dangerous or is unsafe, which sign shall be abated by removal immediately. Nonconforming on-premises signs located on property within the Solana Beach redevelopment plan area shall be abated without compensation not later than 90 days following the notice from the city which notice shall be given within five days after substantial completion of the railroad grade separation project as determined by the city manager, irrespective of any amortization period established by Chapter 2.5 of Division 3 of the California Business and Professions Code and subject only to the requirements of subparagraphs (4)(a) and (b) of this subsection. 

Whenever a sign subject to this subsection is also subject to the provisions of Chapter 2.5 of Division 3 of the California Business and Professions Code relating to compensation, the city council may require the abatement of the sign by payment of the compensation calculated according to those provisions, or may extend the time for abatement of the sign up to and including December 31, 2006, at which time the sign shall be abated without compensation.

a. If such sign has been allowed to be depreciated for tax purposes by the Internal Revenue Service and the owner of the sign presents evidence that the value of the sign has not fully depreciated upon expiration of the five-year abatement period, such sign may remain until the expiration of the depreciation period which was in effect on the date that the sign became nonconforming. 

b. Documentation necessary to establish the remaining or undepreciated value of the sign shall be submitted to the director of community development prior to the expiration of the five-year abatement period. The director of community development shall determine the validity of all documentation presented. Appeals from the decision of the director of community development may be made to the city council in accordance with the appeal procedures set forth in Chapter 17.04 SBMC. 

c. Any sign installed in conformance with a site development permit or plan approved by the city council pursuant to Solana Beach Ordinance No. 80, or any predecessor city ordinance, or as permitted by a comprehensive sign plan approved as a requirement of an adopted site development plan or permit, shall not be considered a nonconforming sign so long as the site development permit or plan or sign plan remains valid. 

In order to implement the requirements of this subsection, the code enforcement officer may prepare an inventory of nonconforming signs, and may give notice to the owners of such a sign, or to the property owner if the sign owner is not known, of the requirements of this section. The inventory of nonconforming signs prepared by the code enforcement officer may be based on an inventory prepared by the county of San Diego or by any other person.

If the sign is not so repaired, painted or removed within such time, the director of community development shall have the power to cause the sign to be removed at the expense of the owner of the premises. (Ord. 140 § 1, 1991) 


17.64.180 Violations. 

A. Penalty. Each person, corporation, association, partnership or firm who places, maintains or causes to be placed or maintained a sign in violation of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of an offense punishable pursuant to SBMC Title 1.

The time for compliance with the original order shall be stayed during the pendency of the hearing. Whenever the permittee, owner or person in charge of the sign fails to comply with an order of the director of community development made pursuant to this section, the director of community development or the director’s designee may remove the sign. The expense of the removal shall be charged to the permittee, owner or person in charge of the sign. Such amount shall constitute a debt owed to the city. No permit shall thereafter be issued to any permittee, owner or person in charge of a sign who fails to pay such costs. Any costs, including attorney’s fees, incurred by the city in collection of the costs shall be added to the amount of the debt. 

B. Removal of Temporary Signs. Whenever a temporary sign has been erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the director of community development, or a designated city employee authorized to enforce city ordinances, shall give written notice to remove the sign to the permittee, owner or person in charge of the sign. The notice shall specify the nature of the violation, order the cessation thereof, require the removal of the sign within 72 hours of the time of the notice, and advise the permittee of the hearing rights established by this subsection. Before the expiration of the 72-hour period, the permittee, owner or person in charge of the sign shall remove the sign or may request a hearing. The request shall be in writing and filed with the community development department. The hearing shall be held by the director of community development or his designee within 72 hours of the day the request is filed. The person issuing in the notice to remove shall not be designated as the hearing officer. The hearing shall be limited to whether the sign was erected or is maintained in violation of this chapter. Notice of the time of the hearing may be given in writing, by telephone or by other form of communication. After the hearing, the order to remove may be affirmed, altered or revoked. The decision of the hearing officer shall be made in writing. If the permittee, owner or person in charge of the sign fails to comply with the notice to remove or the decision of the hearing officer, the director of community development or the director’s designee may remove or cause the removal of the sign. The expense of the removal shall be charged to the permittee, owner or person in charge of the sign. Such amount shall constitute a debt owed to the city. No permit of a temporary sign shall thereafter be issued to any permittee, owner or person in charge of a sign who fails to pay such costs. Any costs, including attorney’s fees, incurred by the city in collection of the costs shall be added to the amount of the debt.

C. Immediate Removal of Hazardous Signs or Signs on Public Property. Any lettering, advertisement, card, poster, sign or notice of any kind placed upon public property or on any curb, sidewalk, post, pole, lamp post, hydrant, bridge, tree or other surface located on public property in violation of the provisions of this chapter, or any sign which constitutes an immediate peril to persons or property, may be removed without prior notice by any officer or employee of the city designated to do so by the city manager. For the purposes of this subsection, “public property” shall have the meaning established in SBMC 17.64.040. The cost of removal and of any damage to public property resulting from the erection or removal of a sign under this subsection shall be charged to the person who placed the sign, or caused the sign to be placed. 

D. Charge of Cost of Removal. The city may recover the cost of signs removed as authorized by subsections A, B and C of this section in accordance with the following provisions: 

1. When the city has incurred any expense in removing the sign or other matter or in repairing public property damaged because of the posting or removal of the sign or other matter, any such expense incurred shall constitute a debt owed to the city. The finance director shall send a bill to the person responsible for posting or causing to be posted the sign or other matter for the actual or estimated costs of removal. The finance director may establish administrative regulations to govern the billing procedures. Each bill shall include the cost, both direct and indirect, involved in the removing of the sign or other matter and in administering the billing procedure. The bill shall describe the basis of the amount billed by indicating the number of signs or other matter posed illegally, the time necessary for removal, the hourly cost of removal, the right to a hearing and other relevant information. The bill shall also specify a date by which the bill is to be paid which date shall be not less than 10 business days after the bill is mailed. 

2. Every person billed may request a hearing before the finance director to determine the appropriateness of the charges. The hearing shall be held within 45 days of the date of the request. Following the hearing, the finance director shall within 10 business days after the date of the hearing notify the person billed of any adjustment to the bill or any determination not to make an adjustment. This notification shall specify the date by which such bill shall be paid, which date shall in no event be less than 30 calendar days after the date of the hearing. Any person who fails to pay the amount billed to such person for such violation within the period specified in this section shall also be liable for expenses incurred by the city in collecting the debt, including the cost of paying city employees or other persons engaged in debt collection. 

E. Evidence. In any action, hearing or other proceeding for violation of any of the provisions of this section, proof that the sign or other matter contains the name of or otherwise identifies a person, firm or corporation, or the particular committee or organization shall constitute prima facie evidence that the person, firm, corporation and chairman, president or other head of the committee or organization posted, or caused to be posted, the sign or other matter. 

F. Hearing Regarding Signs Removed Pursuant to Subsection C. The owner or person in charge of any lettering, advertisement, card, poster, sign or notice of any kind placed upon property, which has been removed by an officer or employee of the city without prior notice of the owner or person in charge pursuant to the provisions of subsection C of this section may request a hearing to be conducted by the director of community development or the director’s designee. The request for hearing shall be made in writing to the director of finance no later than 15 calendar days from the date the director of finance mails the billing statement specified in subsection C of this section or within 30 days of the date of the removal, whichever occurs first. The hearing shall be limited to determining whether the lettering, advertisement, card, poster, sign, notice or other matter was located upon public property in violation of the provisions of this chapter or constituted an immediate peril to persons or property and the accuracy of the amount billed or to those matters set forth in subsection (D)(1) and (2). Upon receiving a written request for the hearing, the finance director shall notify the director of community development of the request. The director of community development, or the director’s designee, shall set a hearing of not less than 15 nor more than 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request and shall provide written notification of the hearing to the applicant. The notification shall include the date, time and place of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall be made in writing. 

G. Finality of Decision. The decision of the hearing officer under subsections A, B, D or F of this section shall be final. 

H. Disposition of Sign Materials Removed by City Officials. Any lettering, advertisement, card, poster, sign or notice which has been removed under this section may be returned to the owner upon payment to the city of the costs of removal as specified in this section. If no timely request is made for hearing or if no demand is made for the return of the materials removed within the time permitted for requesting a hearing, the director of community development is authorized to destroy or dispose of the removed material. Signs shall be held for a minimum of 20 days. 

I. Other Criminal or Civil Proceedings. The provisions of this section are alternative and additional remedies for the enforcement of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall preclude the city from enforcing the provisions of this chapter by any other criminal or civil proceeding. (Ord. 140 § 1, 1991)1

Ordinance 185 amended Title 17 in its entirety. Section 6 of that ordinance stated that this chapter was unaffected by the amendment.

Sections:

17.66.010    Purpose and intent.

17.66.020    Applicability.

17.66.030    Application requirements.

17.66.040    Review authority and procedure.

17.66.050    Reasonable accommodation findings and decision.

17.66.060    Appeal of determination.


17.66.010 Purpose and intent.

This chapter provides a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the “Acts”) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures. (Ord. 445 § 5, 2014)


17.66.020 Applicability.

A. A request for a reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning, and building laws, regulations, policies, or practices may be made by any person with a disability, or by an entity acting on behalf of a person or persons with disabilities, to secure equal access to housing. This chapter applies to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts. An individual with a disability is generally someone who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone with a record of such impairment. A disability does not include impairments resulting from the current, illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance.

B. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made in the manner prescribed by SBMC 17.66.030. (Ord. 445 § 5, 2014)


17.66.030 Application requirements.

A request for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted to the community development department on application forms prescribed by the community development department to include but not be limited to the following items:

A. Application form signed by the property owner or authorized agent;

B. The applicant’s name, address and telephone number;

C. The street address and assessor’s parcel number of the property for which the request is being made;

D. The current and proposed use of the property;

E. The name, address, and telephone number of the individual with a disability for whom the reasonable accommodation is being requested;

F. The basis for the claim that the individual (or group of individuals, if application is made by an entity acting on behalf of a person or persons with disabilities) is considered disabled under the Acts;

G. A description of the reasonable accommodation request and the land use or zoning law, provision, building regulation or policy to be modified or waived;

H. A statement of the reason why the requested accommodation is necessary for the individual with a disability to use and enjoy the dwelling. (Ord. 445 § 5, 2014)


17.66.040 Review authority and procedure.

A. If the reasonable accommodation request requires another city permit or approval, an application for a reasonable accommodation must be submitted with and processed concurrently with the application for the other city permit, whether such permit is ministerial or discretionary.

B. An application for a reasonable accommodation associated with a ministerial permit shall be reviewed by the community development director. The community development director shall make a written determination within 30 days after a complete application for a reasonable accommodation is submitted, and shall either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for a reasonable accommodation in accordance with SBMC 17.66.050.

C. If the application request is associated with a discretionary permit, the reasonable accommodation request will be heard simultaneously with the application for the discretionary permit. The decision to grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for a reasonable accommodation will be made in writing by the authority taking action on the other discretionary permit in accordance with SBMC 17.66.050. (Ord. 445 § 5, 2014)


17.66.050 Reasonable accommodation findings and decision.

A. The requested accommodation may be approved or granted with modifications if the following findings can be made:

1. The housing which is the subject of the request will be used by one or more individuals with a disability protected under the Acts;

2. The accommodation requested is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling;

3. The requested reasonable accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; and

4. The requested reasonable accommodation will not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to the general plan, zoning ordinance, and building laws.

B. The following criteria, among other factors, may be considered by the community development director regarding the reasonableness of the requested accommodation:

1. Whether there are alternative reasonable accommodations available that would provide an equivalent level of benefit; and

2. Whether the requested reasonable accommodation substantially affects the physical attributes of the property or has impacts on surrounding properties that would fundamentally alter a city program or law.

C. The community development director may impose any conditions of approval needed to ensure that the project complies with the required findings in subsection A of this section. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, ensuring that any removable structures or physical design features that are constructed or installed in association with a reasonable accommodation are capable of being removed once those structures or physical design features are no longer necessary to provide access to the dwelling unit for the current occupants.

D. If an application for reasonable accommodation is approved, the request shall be granted to an individual and shall not run with the land unless it is determined that: (1) the modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the code, or (2) the accommodation is to be used by another individual with a disability, and the finding in subsection (A)(1) of this section can be made. (Ord. 445 § 5, 2014)


17.66.060 Appeal of determination.

The decision of the community development director to grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation shall become final 15 calendar days after the notice of decision unless a notice of appeal to the city council is filed in accordance with SBMC 17.72.070. (Ord. 445 § 5, 2014)


Chapter 17.68 PERMITS AND VARIANCES

Sections:

17.68.010    Conditional use permits.

17.68.020    Variances.

17.68.030    Minor exceptions.

17.68.040    Development review permits.

17.68.050    Coastal development permits.

17.68.060    Planned unit developments.

17.68.070    Exclusions from permit requirements for repair, maintenance and utility hook-ups.


17.68.010 Conditional use permits.

A. Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose of these regulations to provide for the review of certain types of uses which because of their unique site or design requirements, operating characteristics or potential adverse effects, require special consideration to assure compatibility with the surrounding area. The conditional use permit process is intended to afford an opportunity for public review and evaluation of such uses, to provide adequate mitigation of any potentially adverse impacts, and to ensure that the development regulations of this title are met.

It is further intended that in exchange for the development and land use privileges extended under a conditional use permit, the permittee will agree to abide by all conditions which the city may require. Both these privileges and conditions shall constitute a covenant which runs with the land, and in addition to binding the permittee, shall likewise bind each successor in interest.

B. Conditional Use Permit Required.

1. Uses which require a conditional use permit are indicated in SBMC 17.12.020 (Use Regulations Matrix) Table 17.12.020-A:

“C”     indicates that the use is subject to a conditional use permit issued by the director of community development in accordance with the procedures of this section.

“CC”    indicates that the use is subject to a conditional use permit issued by the city council in accordance with the procedures of this section.

2. In the event a use is not specifically listed, but is similar in character to a conditional use which is listed, the director of community development shall have the authority to categorize such use. In the event there is difficulty in categorizing a given use, or the director’s categorization is disputed, the procedure outlined in SBMC 17.12.030 (Use Determination) shall be followed.

3. Without first having obtained a conditional use permit, it shall be unlawful for any person to construct a building or operate a use when such building or use is required by the provisions of this title to obtain a conditional use permit.

4. No building permit or other development permits shall be issued relating to a project for which a conditional use permit is required by this title until a conditional use permit is obtained.

C. Authority to Grant Permit. The city council and the director of community development are authorized to grant conditional use permits in accordance with the procedures of this section and to impose reasonable conditions. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements for special yards, open spaces, buffers, fences, walls, and screening; requirements for installation and maintenance of landscaping and erosion control measures; requirements for street improvements and dedications, regulation of vehicular ingress and egress, and traffic circulation; regulation of signs; regulation of hours or other characteristics of operation; requirements for maintenance of landscaping and other improvements; establishment of development schedules or time limits for performance or completion; requirements for periodical review by the city council or director of community development; and such other conditions as the city council or director of community development may deem necessary to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses, to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare, and to make the findings required by subsection F of this section.

D. Application. An application for a conditional use permit shall be submitted to the department of community development on forms provided by the department. The application shall contain sufficient information and plans to permit review pursuant to this section. An application processing fee in an amount established by city council resolution shall be paid at the time of submission of the application.

E. Public Hearing.

1. The director of community development shall hold a public hearing on each application for a conditional use permit for which director approval is required. The hearings shall be set and notice given as prescribed in SBMC 17.72.030 (Public Hearings and Notice Requirements).

2. The city council shall hold a public hearing on each application for a conditional use permit for which city council approval is required. The hearings shall be set and notice given as prescribed in SBMC 17.72.030 (Public Hearings and Notice Requirements).

F. Findings.

1. Before granting a conditional use permit, the planning director or city council shall make all of the following findings:

a. That the proposed use is in accord with the general plan, the general intent of this title, and the purposes of the zone in which the site is located.

b. That the proposed use, together with the conditions applicable thereto, will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

c. That the proposed use complies with each of the applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance, unless a variance is granted pursuant to SBMC 17.68.020.

2. If the conditional use permit is for the purpose of permitting an expansion, restoration, or extension of a nonconforming use or structure then only the findings of Chapter 17.16 SBMC must be made.

G. Appeals. Decisions on conditional use permit applications made by the director of community development may be appealed by the applicant or other aggrieved party to the city council in accordance with SBMC 17.72.070 (Appeals). Decisions on conditional use permits made by the city council shall be final.

H. Pre-existing Conditional Use Permits.

1. A use or structure legally established by conditional use permit prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title may continue in accordance with Chapter 17.16 SBMC (Nonconforming Uses and Structures); provided, that the use is operated and maintained in compliance with the conditions prescribed at the time of its establishment, if any.

2. The alteration, expansion, or reconstruction of a structure housing a use legally established by conditional use permit prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title shall comply with Chapter 17.16 SBMC (Nonconforming Uses and Structures).

3. A use or structure legally established by conditional use permit prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title may be considered for expansion, restoration, or time extension pursuant to the issuance of a new conditional use permit granted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 17.16 SBMC (Nonconforming Uses and Structures).

I. Revisions/Modifications to Conditional Use Permits. Revisions or modifications to a conditional use permit may be requested by the permittee or successor in interest. Further, the city council may periodically review, modify or revoke a conditional use permit.

1. Revision/Modifications by Permittee or Successor in Interest. A revision or modification to an approved conditional use permit, such as, but not limited to, changes in conditions, expansions, intensification of use, or changes in location or hours of operation, may be requested by the permittee or successor in interest. Such request shall be processed as described in subsections D through G of this section. The application shall indicate the reasons for the requested change.

2. Review by the City Council. The city council may periodically review any conditional use permit to ensure that it is being operated in a manner consistent with the conditions of approval or in a manner which is not detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties in the vicinity. If, after such review, the city council determines that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a full examination, then a public hearing date shall be set.

3. Modification or Revocation by the City Council for Cause. After setting a date for public hearing as described in subsection (I)(2) above, the director of community development shall notify the holder of the conditional use permit in question. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall state that the city council will be reviewing the conditional use permit for possible modification or revocation for cause. A hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in SBMC 17.72.030 (Public Hearings and Notice Requirements). The director of community development shall fully investigate the evidence and prepare a report for the city council’s consideration. Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the city council shall render a decision which is supported by one of the following findings to be included in the resolution:

i. The conditional use permit is being conducted in an appropriate manner and that no action to modify or revoke is necessary; or

ii. The conditional use permit is not being conducted in an appropriate manner and that modifications to conditions are necessary; or

iii. The conditional use permit is not being conducted in an appropriate manner and modifications are not available to mitigate the adverse impacts to surrounding properties. The permit is therefore revoked and the operation shall cease and desist in the time allotted by the city council.

If the city council either modifies or revokes a conditional use permit, the reasons for such action shall be stated within the resolution. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.68.020 Variances.

A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility from the strict application of development standards where special circumstances pertaining to a property would otherwise deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and in the same zone. Such special circumstances include hardships caused by size, shape, topography, or location of property where remedies exist which are not detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare and are consistent with the purpose and intent of this title. Any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment authorized will not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property is located.

B. Decision Making Authority.

1. The director of community development is authorized to approve, deny, or approve with conditions the variance applications specified in subsection C of this section. Conditions may include, but shall not be limited to, requirements for special yards, open spaces, buffers, fences, walls, and screening; requirements for installation and maintenance of landscaping and erosion control measures; requirements for street improvements and dedications; regulation of vehicular ingress and egress, and traffic circulation; regulation of signs; regulation of hours or other characteristics of operation; requirements for maintenance of landscaping and other improvements; establishment of development schedules or time limits for performance or completion; requirements for periodic review by the director; and such other conditions as the director may deem necessary to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses, to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare, and to make the findings required by subsection E of this section.

2. A variance shall not be granted to extend use regulations. Flexibility to the use regulations is provided pursuant to SBMC 17.68.010 (Conditional Use Permits) and SBMC 17.12.030 (Use Determination).

3. Variances may be granted in conjunction with conditional use permits and development review permits; provided the findings of subsection E of this section are made. Such variances do not require a separate application or a separate public hearing.

C. Application. An application for a variance shall be filed with the department of community development on a form provided by the department. The application shall contain sufficient information to permit review pursuant to this section. An application processing fee in an amount established by city council resolution shall be paid at the time of submission of the application.

D. Public Hearing. The director of community development shall hold a public hearing on each application for a variance. The hearing shall be set and notice given as prescribed in SBMC 17.72.030 (Public Hearings and Notice Requirements).

E. Findings. Before granting a variance, the director of community development shall make all of the following findings:

1. That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of the general plan and intent of this title.

2. That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved, or to the intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone.

3. That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties in the same zone.

4. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

F. Appeals. Decisions on variance applications may be appealed by the applicant or other aggrieved party to the city council in accordance with SBMC 17.72.070 (Appeals).

G. Expiration of Variance. If construction (or other entitlement) authorized by an approved variance has not been commenced within two years of the variance approval, the variance shall be rendered null and void, unless an extension has been granted.

H. Consistency of Working Drawings with Approved Plans. A variance approval shall pertain only to those plans reviewed and approved with the variance. Further, all plans approved with a variance shall be considered an integral part of the variance approval. The director of community development shall ensure that any final working drawings for grading or construction authorized by a variance approval are consistent with said previous reviewed plans prior to release of working drawings for plan check. The director may approve minor variations from previously reviewed plans if it is determined that the original plan concepts are being carried out.

I. Revocation. A variance may be revoked or modified (including the imposition of additional conditions) by the director of community development or the city council upon finding that the conditions of approval of the variance have not been met or that the land use is being operated in violation of other provisions of this title. A public hearing shall be held in accordance with SBMC 17.72.030 (Public Hearing and Notice Requirements) prior to action on the revocation or modification. The director of community development may schedule such a hearing upon preliminary finding of noncompliance with any of the preceding requirements. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.68.030 Minor exceptions.

A. Purpose. In order to provide for the flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of this title, this section provides for the administrative review and adjustment of selected site development regulations as set forth in subsection C of this section.

B. Authority. The director of community development is authorized to grant a minor exception in accordance with the procedures in this section and to impose reasonable conditions.

C. Development Regulations Which Qualify.

1. Only the following development regulations shall qualify for a minor exception:

a. Fence Height. In any zone the director may allow an increase to the maximum height of any fence, wall, retaining wall or equivalent screening by a maximum of two feet, where the topography of sloping sites or a difference in grade between adjoining sites warrants such increase in height to maintain a level of privacy, or to maintain effective screening.

b. Parking Design Standards. In any zone, the director may waive or modify one or more of the parking design standards set forth in SBMC 17.52.030 where practical difficulties make their strict application infeasible, and upon a finding that the waiver or modification is consistent with the purpose and intent of the City of Solana Beach Offstreet Parking Design Manual and Chapter 17.52 SBMC.

2. More than one minor exception for any parcel shall constitute a variance and shall be reviewed in accordance with SBMC 17.68.020 (Variances).

D. Application. An application for a minor exception shall be filed with the department of community development on a form provided by the department. The application shall contain sufficient information to permit review pursuant to this section. An application processing fee in an amount established by city council resolution shall be paid at the time of submission of the application.

E. Notification. The director shall notify the applicant and all property owners within 300 feet of the subject site for floor area minor exceptions (inclusive of public rights-of-way) and within 50 feet of the subject site for fence height, setbacks or parking design standard minor exceptions (exclusive of public rights-of-way) by mail 20 days prior to the director’s decision. Said notice shall state the following:

1. Requested action;

2. Location of the requested action;

3. Name and address (parcel and lot number) of the applicant;

4. Date which a decision will be made on application.

F. Findings. Before granting a minor exception, the director of community development shall make all of the following findings:

1. That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship inconsistent with the objectives of the general plan and intent of this title.

2. That the granting of the minor exception will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

G. Appeals. Decisions on minor exception applications may be appealed by the applicant or other aggrieved party to the city council in accordance with SBMC 17.72.070 (Appeals). (Ord. 357 § 6, 2007; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.68.040 Development review permits.

A. Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations to provide for the review of certain classes of development projects which due to their scale, proximity to environmentally sensitive resource areas, or unique design features as permitted by a zone or specific plan, require special discretionary consideration to insure consistency with the general plan and the intent of the zone in which the property is located. These regulations are intended to encourage site and structural development which (1) respects the physical and environmental characteristics of the site, (2) ensures safe and convenient access and circulation for pedestrians and vehicles, and (3) exemplifies the best professional design practices. It is further the intent of this section to eliminate confusion and processing burdens by the consolidation of all overlay zone and special district requirements into a single permit process.

B. Projects Requiring Development Review Permits.

1. An application for a development review permit shall be required for any structure or site development which meets any of the following criteria:

a. New construction (including structural additions to existing development) totaling 30,000 gross square feet or more, except greenhouses in the (A) zone and structures in residential zones.

b. Any residential projects of 20 or more units.

c. Any new common interest developments.

d. Any site development (including grading for any purpose) or construction (including any structural additions to existing development) that involves an aggregate of more than 100 cubic yards of cut and/or fill, excepting:

i. The excavation for the construction of residential swimming pools/spas including backfilling/elimination of existing swimming pools/spas; and

ii. City of Solana Beach approved public works projects in the existing public right-of-way.

e. Any new residential structure or structural addition in the MHR or HR zones which exceeds 25 feet in height and any new nonresidential structure or structural addition which exceeds 30 feet in height.

f. Any development on property located within the hillside overlay zone (HOZ), except minor additions to existing single-family residences which do not increase the existing building envelope or require more than 100 cubic yards of grading. (See SBMC 17.48.020, Hillside overlay zone, for additional exemptions.)

g. Any development on property located within the scenic area overlay zone (SAOZ), except minor additions to existing structures which do not increase the existing building envelope or floor area by more than 10 percent or require more than 50 cubic yards of grading. (See SBMC 17.48.010, Scenic Area Overlay Zone for additional exemptions).

h. Any development on property located within the floodplain overlay zone (FPOZ), except a single-family residence on a single lot including accessory structures thereto which is located at least one foot above the 100-year flood level and is otherwise designed to withstand periodic flooding.

i. Any development on a coastal bluff top property or on the face or toe of a bluff for which a coastal development permit issued by the California Coastal Commission is presently required.

j. Any development which involves the exterior alteration of a designated historical/cultural landmark pursuant to SBMC 17.60.160 (Historic/Cultural Landmark Designation Regulations).

k. Any development project or development option for which a development review permit is required pursuant to a zone, overlay zone, specific plan or other regulatory provision of this title.

l. Any new commercial development or construction (including any structural addition to existing development) located within any commercial zone which results in an increase of more than 500 feet of gross floor area or to the overall building envelope. This requirement shall apply to any property with an underlying zoning designation defined in Chapters 17.24 (commercial, light commercial, office professional and light industrial), 17.28 (special commercial), 17.32 (public institutional) and 17.40 (open space/recreation) SBMC.

m. Any development on a property located within the scaled residential overlay zone (SROZ) shall also be subject to the SROZ superseding development regulations (SBMC 17.48.040), except as otherwise provided in that section.

Note: SBMC 17.48.040 (scaled residential overlay zone – (SROZ)) developments and/or projects located in the proposed SROZ do not require a development review permit (DRP) due to their location in the SROZ alone. However, be advised that any project or structure requiring a DRP as described in subsection (B)(1)(a) through (l) of this section that is located in the SROZ shall also be subject to SBMC 17.48.040 (SROZ) development regulations.

n. Any new construction, including replacement of an existing structure or structural additions to existing development in residential zones, shall require a development review permit if either or both of the following development criteria are satisfied:

i. The total of existing square footage plus proposed new square footage of the structure exceeds 60 percent of the maximum floor area allowable under the applicable floor area ratio.

Drought tolerant plant materials and water conserving irrigation systems shall be incorporated into all landscaping plans.

4. Roads, Pedestrian Walkways, Parking, and Storage Areas. Any development involving more than one building or structure shall provide common access roads and pedestrian walkways. Parking and outside storage areas, where permitted, shall be screened from view, to the extent feasible, by existing topography, by the placement of buildings and structures, or by landscaping and plantings.

5. Grading. To the extent feasible, natural topography and scenic features of the site shall be retained and incorporated into the proposed development. Any grading or earth-moving operations in connection with the proposed development shall be planned and executed so as to blend with the existing terrain both on and adjacent to the site. Existing exposed or disturbed slopes shall be landscaped with native or naturalized non-native vegetation and existing erosion problems shall be corrected.

6. Lighting. Light fixtures for walkways, parking areas, driveways, and other facilities shall be provided in sufficient number and at proper locations to assure safe and convenient nighttime use. All light fixtures shall be appropriately shielded so that no light or glare is transmitted or reflected in such concentrated quantities or intensities as to be detrimental to the surrounding area. All exterior lighting, including lighting in designated “dark sky” areas, shall be in conformance with SBMC 17.60.060 (Exterior Lighting Regulations).

7. Usable Open Space. Recreational facilities proposed within required usable open space areas shall be located and designed to maintain essential open space values. Consideration shall be given to type and quantity of such uses, including but not limited to golf courses, picnic and barbecue areas, tot lots, open playing fields, swimming pools and spas, and court facilities.

G. Public Hearing. The director of community development shall transmit the application for a development review permit together with a recommendation thereon to the city council when all necessary reports and processing have been completed. The city council shall hold a public hearing on each application for a development review permit and shall render its decision by resolution. The hearings shall be set and notice given as prescribed in SBMC 17.72.030 (Public Hearing and Notice Requirements).

H. City Council Determination and Findings. The city council may approve or conditionally approve a development review permit only if all of the following findings can be made:

1. The proposed development is consistent with the general plan and all applicable requirements of this title, including special regulations, overlay zones, and specific plans.

2. The proposed development complies with the development review criteria set forth in subsection F of this section.

3. All required permits and approvals issued by the city, including variances, conditional use permits, comprehensive sign plans, and coastal development permits have been obtained prior to or concurrently with the development review permit.

4. If the development project also requires a permit or approval to be issued by a state or federal agency, the city council may conditionally approve the development review permit upon the applicant obtaining the required permit or approval from the other agency.

If the above findings cannot be made, the city council shall deny the development review permit.

I. Conditions of Approval. The city council in approving a development review permit may impose special conditions or requirements that include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Special setbacks, yards, open spaces;

2. Special regulation of the height and bulk of buildings;

3. Special requirements for fences and walls;

(This section reserved for future ordinance).


17.68.060 Planned unit developments.

A. Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose of these planned unit development regulations to encourage the creative use of land and open space by permitting some carefully controlled relief from the strict application of the provisions of existing zoning districts. It allows flexibility and diversification in (1) the relationships of various buildings, structures and open space in planned building groups, and (2) in the allowable heights of buildings and structures, while insuring substantial compliance to the zone regulations and other provisions of this chapter by continuing to observe adequate standards related to public safety, health and general welfare without unduly inhibiting the advantages of modern imaginative site planning, and to implement the following objectives:

1. To provide a more desirable living environment;

2. To encourage creative approaches to the development of land;

3. To encourage the preservation of and the aesthetic use of open space.

B. Applicability. The planned unit development procedure may be used in combination with any one of the residential, commercial or industrial zones of this title.

C. Permitted Uses. No other than permitted principal, permitted accessory and conditional uses allowed in the zoning district with which the planned unit development is requested shall be permitted.

D. Project Area. The area of a planned unit development shall be no less than five acres; provided, however, that the city council may waive the minimum requirement where they find special and unusual circumstances of site and location do, in their judgment, warrant the use of this procedure on smaller areas.

E. Basic Principles. In considering a planned unit development for a site, the applicant(s) and the city shall be governed by the following requirements:

1. Conformity to Standards. Development within a planned unit approval in conformance with the procedures contained herein is exempt from the specific property development standards of the zone in which it is located, and those standards of SBMC 16.16.010 (Design of Subdivision), providing the plans and exhibits submitted and approved in conformance with these provisions clearly establish that the relationships of interior and exterior living, working or shopping areas and the associated environment are more desirable than would otherwise be achieved with the strict application of the requirements of this title, and those subdivision standards. Exception to development standards and other provisions of the zone in which the planned unit is located shall only be to the extent specified in the approved plans and exhibits.

2. Density. The number of dwelling units permitted in a planned unit development on a parcel or unit of land shall not exceed the number of lots into which the parcel or unit could lawfully be subdivided applying the design and improvement standards of the city’s subdivision ordinance and the minimum lot size standards of the city zoning ordinances. However, overall density may be increased pursuant to the provisions of SBMC 17.20.050 (Density Bonus).

F. Application. An application for a planned unit development shall be processed as prescribed for a conditional use permit, SBMC 17.68.010, and shall be heard by the city council.

G. Findings. In order to grant a planned unit development, the city council shall find the following:

1. The proposed planned unit development conforms to the general plan in terms of general location, density and general standards of development;

2. The development of a harmonious, integrated project in accordance with a precise development plan justifies exceptions, if such are required, to the normal requirements of this title. 

H. Planned unit development for common interest or condominium minor subdivision of lots legally developed with more than one primary single-family dwelling unit.

Notwithstanding subsections (B), (D), (F)(2) and (G)(1) of this section, a planned unit development permit may be approved or conditionally approved for a common interest or condominium minor subdivision of a lot upon which more than one primary single-family dwelling unit exists if all of the following requirements are met:

1. The property is located in the MR, MHR or HR zones;

2. The single-family residential dwellings on the property were legally existing on July 1, 1986;

3. At least one of the dwellings is occupied by an owner of the property at the time of the application;

4. The project is compatible with the neighborhood, and with the exception of density, the general plan;

5. All other applicable requirements of this section are met. (Ord. 219 § 2, 1996; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)

The city council determines that these regulations are necessary to protect existing residents and tenants, assure that prospective purchasers will be purchasing a housing product that meets current zoning and subdivision standards and assure that creation of the right to sell units does not perpetrate nonconforming structures. This chapter is also intended to implement the provisions of the general plan relating to conversions of developments to condominiums and other common-interest developments. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.020 Permit required.

No person shall create any common interest development or subdivision from an existing multifamily dwelling or apartment development unless a conversion permit has first been approved in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Applications for conversion permits shall be processed according to the same procedures established by this title for the processing of use permits. A conversion permit may be approved by the city council only if the city council finds that the conversion is consistent with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.030 Findings – Notice to tenants of existing buildings being converted to a common-interest development.

Before a conversion permit may be approved, and in addition to all other requirements, the city council shall find that: 

A. Each of the tenants of the proposed development for conversion has been or will be given 180 days’ written notice of intention to convert prior to termination of tenancy due to the conversion or proposed conversion. The provisions of this subdivision shall not alter or abridge the rights or obligations of the parties in performance of their covenants, including but not limited to the provisions of services, payment of rent or the obligations imposed by Sections 1941, 1941.1 and 1941.2 of the Civil Code.

B. This notice shall be provided to all tenants. Each of the tenants of the proposed condominium, planned development, community apartment or stock cooperative project has been or will be given notice of an exclusive right to contract for the purchase of their respective units upon the same terms and conditions that such units will be initially offered to the general public or terms more favorable to the tenant at least 60 days before application for conversion. The right shall run for a period of not less than 90 days from the date of issuance of the subdivision public report pursuant to Section 11018.2 of the Business and Professions Code, unless the tenant gives prior written notice of his intention not to exercise the right. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.040 Tenant relocation expenses.

As a requirement of a conversion permit, the permittee shall provide relocation assistance equal to one month’s rent to any residential tenant who relocates from the building to be converted after receipt from the subdivider of the notification required by this chapter, except when the tenant has given notice of his intent to vacate prior to receipt of the notification from the applicant. Relocation assistance shall be provided no later than 15 days following the applicant’s receipt of notification from the tenant of the tenant’s intent to vacate unless other arrangements are made in writing between the tenant and the applicant or permittee. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.050 Zoning regulations consistency.

 No conversion permit may be approved unless the city council finds that the project conforms to all current development standards and requirements of this title applicable to the type of development to which the conversion is made including, without limitation, parking requirements, setbacks, requirements for recreational facilities and other zoning standards. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.060 Structural development standards.

All residential conversion projects shall comply with or be conditioned to meet the current building standards and requirements of SBMC Title 15, including but not limited to: 

A. Thermal insulation; 

B. Sound separations; 

C. Fire prevention equipment, including without limitation fire sprinkler systems; 

D. Building construction requirements;

E. Separate gas and electrical metered service for each unit; and

F. Separate water metered service for each unit, or a plan for apportioning the water costs of each subsequent unit owner shall be proposed. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.070 Physical element report.

 As part of the application submittal, a building evaluation report shall be submitted to the planning department. The building evaluation report shall evaluate estimated remaining useful life and replacement cost of roofs, driveways, foundation, plumbing, electrical, heating, air conditioning and other mechanical and structural systems. The report shall be prepared by a licensed mechanical or structural engineer or licensed general building contractor. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.080 Reservation of affordable units.

As a requirement of approval of a permit to convert a development consisting of 10 or more dwelling units, 10 percent of the units shall be reserved in perpetuity for sale or rental to qualified very low and low-income households. As a requirement of approval of a permit to convert a development consisting of less than 10 dwelling units, the applicant shall pay a fee in an amount established by city council resolution in lieu of reserving units. For conversion of greater than 10 units, if the calculation of 10 percent of the total units results in a fraction of a unit, then the subdivider may pay only an in-lieu fee apportioned according to the fraction of a unit or reserve an additional unit. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)


17.69.090 General plan vacancy rate requirements.

A conversion permit shall not be approved if at the time of consideration of the permit the citywide vacancy rate/requirements of the general plan are not met. (Ord. 163 § 1, 1992)1

Ordinance 185 amended Title 17 in its entirety. Section 6 of that ordinance stated that this chapter was unaffected by the amendment.

The council hereby determines that this chapter is necessary to assist in meeting the city’s share of the regional housing needs, to implement the city’s general plan and housing element relative to the provision of housing units for all economic sectors of its population, including households with very low and low incomes, and to require affordable housing in both rental and for-sale housing, consistent with the provisions of Government Code Sections 65850(q) and 65850.01.

B. New housing contributes to the demand for goods and services in the city, increasing local employment at wage levels which often do not permit employees to afford housing in the city. Further, new housing construction which does not include affordable units aggravates the existing shortage of affordable housing by absorbing the supply of available residential land. Providing affordable units or impact fees as required by this chapter will ensure that part of the city’s remaining developable land is used to provide affordable housing. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.015 Definitions.

Whenever the following terms are used in this chapter, they shall have the meaning established by this section:

A. “Condominium conversion” means conversion of rental multifamily dwellings or apartments to common-interest subdivisions such as condominiums, community apartments, stock cooperatives or planned developments.

B. “For-sale residential project” means a residential project, or portion thereof, that includes the creation of one or more dwelling units that may be sold individually, including condominiums, community apartments, stock cooperatives, planned developments, and individual lots and dwellings. A for-sale residential project also includes a condominium conversion.

C. “Rental residential project” means a residential project, or portion thereof, that creates dwelling units that cannot be sold individually.

D. “Residential project” means the construction, rehabilitation, remodeling, adaptive reuse, or replacement of structures to create one or more dwelling units. For the purposes of this chapter, a residential project includes a condominium conversion. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.020 Affordable housing required – For-sale residential projects.

A. Affordable Units Required. Developers of for-sale residential projects providing five or more dwelling units, or five or more lots for sale for residential purposes, shall construct and set aside 15 percent of all units or lots for sale to very low or low income households (as defined by Health and Safety Code Sections 50105 and 50079.5, respectively) at sales prices affordable to such persons or households. For the purposes of this chapter, a unit is affordable if it meets the requirements for affordable housing costs for very low or low income households established by Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5 and regulations adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (California Code of Regulations Title 25, Sections 6910 through 6924) determining affordability of residential housing units based upon household size and income levels.

B. Term of Affordability. The required affordable units shall remain affordable for 99 years from the date of final inspection, as shown on the inspection record card for the affordable unit.

C. Applicability to Alternatives. If the developer of a residential project proposes to provide for-sale affordable units as part of an alternative permitted by SBMC 17.70.030, the number and affordability of the for-sale affordable units shall be consistent with subsection A of this section, and the term of affordability shall be consistent with subsection B of this section.

D. Relation to Density Bonuses and Other Incentives. If a for-sale residential project receives a density bonus or other incentives pursuant to Section 65915 of the Government Code and the density bonus ordinance (SBMC 17.20.050), then the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to density bonus units as defined in the density bonus ordinance (SBMC 17.20.050), as required by Section 65915 of the Government Code. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.025 Affordable housing required – Rental residential projects.

A. Affordable Units Required. Developers of rental residential projects providing five or more dwelling units shall construct and set aside 15 percent of all units for rent to very low or low income households (as defined by Health and Safety Code Sections 50105 and 50079.5, respectively) at rents affordable to such persons or households. For the purposes of this chapter, a unit is affordable if it meets the requirements for affordable rent for very low or low income households established by Health and Safety Code Section 50053 and regulations adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (California Code of Regulations Title 25, Sections 6910 through 6924) determining affordability of residential housing units based upon household size and income levels.

B. Term of Affordability. The required rental affordable units shall remain affordable for 99 years from the date of final inspection, as shown on the inspection record card for the affordable unit.

C. Applicability to Alternatives. If the developer of a residential project proposes to provide rental affordable units as part of an alternative permitted by SBMC 17.70.030, the number and affordability of the rental affordable units shall be consistent with subsection A of this section, and the term of affordability shall be consistent with subsection B of this section.

D. Relation to Density Bonuses and Other Incentives. If a rental residential project receives a density bonus or other incentives pursuant to Section 65915 of the Government Code and the density bonus ordinance (SBMC 17.20.050), then the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to density bonus units as defined in the density bonus ordinance (SBMC 17.20.050), as required by Section 65915 of the Government Code. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.027 Fractional units.

When the calculation of the number of affordable units required for a residential project results in a fraction of one-half or more, one additional affordable unit shall be provided. When the calculation results in a fraction of less than one-half, the developer shall either provide an additional affordable unit or pay an affordable housing impact fee calculated by multiplying the area (in square feet) of the average market-rate unit in the project by the fraction, and multiplying that number by the impact fee per square foot. (Example: if the average market-rate unit has 2,500 square feet, and there is a fraction of 0.2, the impact fee would total 500 multiplied by the impact fee per square foot.) (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019)


17.70.030 Alternatives for provision of affordable units.

A. Rental Units in a For-Sale Residential Project.

1. As permitted by Government Code Section 65589.8, a developer of a for-sale residential project may propose to provide rental affordable units rather than for-sale affordable units. The term and affordability of the rental affordable units and the affordable housing agreement and rent regulatory agreement shall conform with the provisions of SBMC 17.70.025(B).

2. If the developer elects to provide rental affordable units, at least 15 percent of the units in the residential project shall be rented to very low or low income households at affordable rents.

3. The rent regulatory agreement shall include provisions for sale of the affordable units and relocation benefits for tenants of the rental affordable units if the owner of the residential project later determines to offer any rental affordable units in the residential project for sale. The owner shall provide all notices to prospective tenants of the residential project required by state law and shall additionally, at the time sale of the units is proposed, provide all tenants of the rental affordable units with the same notices, rights, and relocation benefits as provided by state law and the municipal code for tenants in condominium conversions. The owner shall provide written notice to the city at least 90 days before offering any rental affordable unit for sale. The owner shall provide as many for-sale affordable units at affordable housing cost as are required by SBMC 17.70.020(A). At the time of sale, documents acceptable to the community development director, all consistent with the requirements of this chapter, shall be recorded against the for-sale affordable units for a term of 99 years from the date of sale.

B. Construction of Off-Site Affordable Housing.

1. As an alternative to the construction of affordable units on-site, a developer may propose to construct an affordable housing development on other property within the city. If the units will be for-sale affordable units, the number, affordability, and term of affordability of the affordable units shall conform with the provisions of SBMC 17.70.020(B). If the units will be rental affordable units, the number, affordability, and term of affordability of the affordable units shall conform with the provisions of SBMC 17.70.025(B).

2. The affordable housing plan required by SBMC 17.70.040(A) shall provide evidence of the following, in addition to the requirements of SBMC 17.70.040(A):

a. Financing or a viable financing plan, which may include public funding, shall be in place for the off-site affordable units.

b. The off-site location must be suitable for the proposed affordable housing, consistent with any adopted affordable housing guidelines and the housing element, will not tend to cause residential segregation, and be located within the city of Solana Beach boundaries with appropriate infrastructure and services. Any off-site alternative must comply with the density, intensity and development standards that are permitted under the zone for the site.

3. The affordable housing agreement required by SBMC 17.70.040(B) shall contain the following, in addition to the requirements of SBMC 17.70.040(C):

a. Prior to issuance of a building permit for any unit in the residential development, the off-site development shall have all discretionary permits and approvals necessary for the construction of the affordable housing, and the developer approved by the city shall have purchased the site for the off-site affordable housing.

b. Prior to occupancy of any unit in the residential development, occupancy shall have been authorized for all units in the affordable housing development.

C. Preservation or Conversion of Existing Units. As an alternative to the construction of affordable units on-site, a developer may propose to preserve existing affordable units at risk of loss or convert market-rate units to affordable units, if the preservation or conversion of these units is consistent with Government Code Section 65583.1 and allows the city to substitute the preservation or conversion of these units for the obligation to identify sites.

D. Legalization of Existing Unpermitted Dwelling Units. As an alternative to the construction of affordable units on-site, a developer may acquire and place deed restrictions upon existing housing units within the city constructed without building permits, for occupancy by very low or low income households at prices or rents affordable to such households subject to the following standards and conditions:

1. The developer must demonstrate ownership of the unpermitted dwelling units or an executed agreement with the owner(s) of the dwelling units agreeing to record an affordable housing agreement against the property and to grant the developer access to perform any required rehabilitation or improvements.

2. The existing unpermitted housing units must not have a separate address that was included in the most recent United States Census.

3. The unit(s) shall be ready for occupancy by an eligible household prior to final inspection, as shown on the inspection record card, for any market-rate units in the residential project.

4. A building permit shall be obtained for each unpermitted dwelling unit. Any substandard unit shall be rehabilitated in conformance with applicable local ordinances and state statutes.

5. If the units will be for-sale affordable units, the number, affordability, and term of affordability of the affordable units shall conform with the provisions of SBMC 17.70.020(B). If the units will be rental affordable units, the number, affordability, and term of affordability of the affordable units shall conform with the provisions of SBMC 17.70.025(B).

E. Payment of Affordable Housing Impact Fees. As an alternative to the construction of affordable units on-site, a developer may propose to pay affordable housing impact fees adopted by city council resolution to mitigate the residential project’s impact on the need for affordable housing in the city, if the city council makes both of the following findings:

1. The affordable housing impact fees will be used to provide financial assistance to an identified city or city-sponsored affordable housing project that: (a) is proposed by an affordable housing developer; (b) has received all discretionary approvals from the city and the Coastal Commission; and (c) requires additional funds to commence construction.

2. Provision of the affordable housing impact fee will create more affordable units than would be created by on-site provision of the affordable units.

Any approved affordable housing impact fees shall be paid prior to the first issuance of a building permit for the residential development. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.035 Affordable housing design and standards. 

A. When an affordable unit is required pursuant to this chapter, such unit may be constructed as a separate single-family dwelling unit or may be combined with other dwelling units. Affordable units shall be designed to be integrated into the residential style of the residential project, and shall have the same general bulk, scale, average square footage, same mix, and height as market-rate units in the development. Subject to approval of the community development director or designee, affordable units may have different interior finishes and features than market-rate units in the same residential development project, so long as the finishes and features are durable, of good quality and consistent with contemporary standards for new housing.

B. Affordable units shall be comparable to market-rate units in overall number of bedrooms and the proportion of units in each bedroom category. For multifamily residential projects, the affordable units shall be integrated into the project and located so as not to create a geographic concentration of affordable units within the residential project, unless required to provide housing for senior citizens or to obtain financial assistance from state or federal agencies.

C. All affordable units shall be constructed and occupied concurrently with or prior to the construction and final inspection of market-rate units. In phased residential projects, affordable units shall be constructed and occupied in proportion to the number of units in each phase of the residential project. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.040 Affordable housing plan and affordable housing agreement.

A. Affordable Housing Plan. An affordable housing plan shall be submitted as part of the first approval of any residential project subject to this chapter and shall be processed, reviewed, and approved, conditionally approved, or denied concurrently with all other applications required for the residential project. The affordable housing plan may indicate that the developer intends to pay affordable housing impact fees. However, if affordable units are proposed to be provided, the affordable housing plan shall include the following, as applicable:

1. Number, affordability level, unit type, tenure (for-sale or for-rent), number of bedrooms, location, unit size (square feet), and design of all affordable units.

2. Construction schedule and phasing of affordable units in relation to market-rate units.

3. Any requested alternative pursuant to SBMC 17.70.030, including information as required by SBMC 17.70.030 and reasonably required by the community development director to demonstrate compliance with SBMC 17.70.030 regarding the requirements for that alternative.

4. Such additional information as may be required by the community development director to ensure conformance of the project with this chapter or the general plan or any specific plan.

B. Affordable Housing Agreement – Timing.

1. Prior to final or parcel map approval for the residential project, or, if a tentative or parcel map is not requested for the residential development, prior to issuance of any building permit within the residential development, an affordable housing agreement between the developer and the city shall be recorded against the property included in the residential project. The affordable housing agreement shall be binding on all future owners and successors in interest.

2. The affordable housing agreement and other required agreements shall be prepared by the city at the developer’s expense. After approval of the affordable housing plan, the city manager is authorized to approve the affordable housing agreement and any additional documents necessary to implement this section.

C. Affordable Housing Agreement – Contents. The affordable housing agreement shall be consistent with the affordable housing plan and shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. Number, affordability level, unit type, tenure (for-sale or for-rent), number of bedrooms, location, unit size (square feet), and design of all affordable units.

2. A description of the household income group(s) to be accommodated by the housing development, and the standards for determining the corresponding affordable rent or affordable sales price and housing cost.

3. Description of provisions for income certification and screening of potential purchasers or renters of affordable units, resale control mechanisms (in for-sale units), and ongoing monitoring and administration.

4. Term of affordability.

5. A schedule for completion of affordable units and phasing of development in relation to construction of market-rate units.

6. A description of remedies for breach of the agreement by either party.

7. For for-sale affordable units, conditions governing the initial sale and resale of affordable units to eligible households to ensure continued compliance with the restrictions of this chapter; and a condition requiring disclosure by the developer to the buyer of affordable units of the existence of the deed restrictions affecting the resale of the property.

8. For rental affordable units, conditions establishing rules and procedures for qualifying tenants, setting rental rates, filling vacancies, operating and maintaining rental affordable units, and annually monitoring affordable units. A rent regulatory agreement acceptable to the city shall be recorded against the residential project prior to issuance of a building permit for any dwelling unit in the residential project. The rent regulatory agreement shall include the developer’s agreement to the limitations on rents required by SBMC 17.70.025(A).

9. If an alternative is approved pursuant to SBMC 17.70.030, provisions to ensure that the affordable housing is provided and that the requirements applied to the alternative have been complied with. Where off-site property is proposed for affordable housing, additional restrictions or agreements may be required to be recorded against the off-site property.

10. Other provisions needed to ensure implementation and compliance with this chapter, to ensure continued affordability of the units, or to comply with state or federal law. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.045 Incentives.

Certain types of affordable housing are relatively more desirable in satisfying the city’s affordable housing goals and housing element goals. Although nothing in this chapter establishes a right to receive any additional incentive from the city or any other party or agency to enable the developer to meet the obligations of this chapter, the city council at its sole discretion may discount city fees, expedite the application process, or provide other assistance when it finds that provision of such assistance is needed to meet housing needs identified in the housing element which otherwise would not be met through the implementation of this chapter. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.050 Affordable housing impact fees.

A. Any affordable housing impact fees shall be set by city fee resolution or other action of the city council. Fees may be based on a fee per dwelling unit, fee per square foot, or any other reasonable basis. The city council may review the fees from time to time at its sole discretion and may, based on that review, adjust the fee amount. Affordable housing impact fees shall not exceed the cost of mitigating the impact of residential projects on the need for affordable housing in the city.

B. All affordable housing impact fees shall be deposited into a separate account to be designated the city of Solana Beach housing fund. The fees collected and all earnings from investment of the fees shall be expended exclusively to provide or assure continued provision of affordable housing in the city through acquisition, construction, development assistance, rehabilitation, financing, rent or other subsidies, provision of supportive services, or other methods, and for costs of administering programs which serve those ends. The housing assisted shall be of a type, or made affordable at a cost or rent, for which there is a need in the city and which is not adequately supplied in the city by private housing development in the absence of public assistance and to the extent feasible shall be utilized to provide for low and very low income housing. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.055 Waivers of affordable housing requirements.

A. As part of an application for the first approval of a residential project, a developer may request that the requirements of this chapter be waived or modified, based upon a showing that applying the requirements of this chapter would result in an unconstitutional taking of property or would result in any other unconstitutional result. Any request for a waiver or modification shall be submitted concurrently with the project application. The developer shall set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the claim, including all supporting technical documentation, and shall bear the burden of presenting the requisite evidence to demonstrate the alleged unconstitutional result. Any request for a waiver or modification based on this section shall be reviewed and considered at the same time as the project application. In deciding whether to grant the waiver or modification, the city council shall assume each of the following when it is applicable to the project:

1. The developer will provide the most economical inclusionary units feasible in terms of construction, design, location and tenure (for-sale or for-rent).

2. The developer is likely to obtain housing subsidies when such funds are reasonably available.

B. The waiver or modification may be approved only to the extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result, based upon legal advice provided by or at the behest of the city attorney, after adoption of written findings, based on legal analysis and the evidence. If a waiver or modification is granted, any change in the project shall invalidate the waiver or modification, and a new application shall be required for a waiver or modification pursuant to this section. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019; Ord. 427 § 3, 2011)


17.70.060 Development impact fee reductions for affordable accessory dwelling units.

The city manager is authorized to reduce city development impact fees by 75 percent for accessory dwelling units (ADU) processed consistent with SBMC 17.20.040(D), provided that a deed restriction for state law affordability provisions is recorded for the term of 99 years. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019)


17.70.065 Enforcement.

A. The city attorney shall be authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter and all affordable housing agreements, regulatory agreements, and all other covenants or restrictions placed on affordable units, by civil action and any other proceeding or method permitted by law.

B. Failure of any official or agency to fulfill the requirements of this chapter shall not excuse any applicant or owner from the requirements of this chapter. No permit, license, map, or other approval or entitlement for a residential development shall be issued, including without limitation a final inspection or certificate of occupancy, until all applicable requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.

C. The remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall not preclude the city from any other remedy or relief to which it otherwise would be entitled under law or equity. (Ord. 500 § 5, 2019)1

Prior legislation: Ords. 200, 214, 236 and 284.

5. If the reviewing body determines a substantial error in any of these procedures occurs, the public hearing shall be continued to a future meeting and renotification shall take place. The failure of any person or entity to receive notice given pursuant to this section shall not constitute grounds for any court to invalidate the actions for which the notice was given.

For projects in which no shorter re-application period was granted, the director shall determine whether the new application is for a permit or amendment which is the same or substantially the same as a previously denied permit or amendment. A determination of the director under this section shall be effective on the date of the written notice of decision. (Ord. 415 § 5, 2010; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)

17.72.100 Assignment of permits.

Unless otherwise specified in this title, any permit or other approval shall run with the land and shall continue to be valid upon a change of ownership of the site or structure to which it applies. The city council may specify that approvals for conditional use permits run with the applicant, owner and/or operator. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.72.110 Lapse of approval and extensions.

A. Lapse of Approvals. Unless otherwise specified in this title, approvals for development review permits, structure development permits, conditional use permits, variances, and minor exceptions shall lapse (i.e., expire) and become void 24 months after the date of the approval, unless a different expiration date is specifically established as a condition of the approval or unless the following action occurs:

1. A building permit is issued in accordance with the approval.

B. Extensions. An extension may be issued prior to the lapse (i.e., expiration) of any approval described in subsection A of this section. There is not an absolute right to receive an extension. Approvals originally granted by the director of community development (the “director”) may be extended by the director. Approvals granted by the view assessment committee may only be extended by the city council. Approvals by the city council may only be extended by the city council.

1. One or more (but not more than a total of four) extensions may be granted not exceeding a cumulative total of 24 months after the date the original approval of the project expires. The duration of an extension shall be in an increment of 30 days. The minimum duration of an extension shall be six months. The maximum duration of an extension shall not be more than 12 months. The duration of an extension shall be determined at the discretion of the issuing authority.

2. All applications for extensions shall be filed with the director at least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the approval. Concurrent with the filing of an application for an extension, the applicant shall submit payment of applicable fees and deliver to the director the documents and information required from time-to-time by the city to provide notice of the application to the owners of all properties within a 300 foot radius from the project. An additional 15 days may be provided by the director for supporting documents and information as needed to deem the application complete.

3. An application for an extension shall include the following information and other information reasonably requested by the director or city council:

a. A detailed factual description and explanation of the reasons why a building permit was not issued prior to the expiration of the original approval or preceding extension and the specific reason(s) the extension is necessary; the applicant’s request for a specific time period for the extension; 

b. A detailed description of the actions that will be taken during the specific requested extension period that justify the requested time period of the extension and that will result in the timely issuance of a building permit for the project before the extension expires; and

c. A detailed timeline for the actions that will be taken during the requested extension period.

C. The director or city council may issue an extension of the approval of a project in their discretion if they make all of the following findings:

1. The applicant has presented facts which establish that the applicant has timely and diligently pursued issuance of a building permit during the 24 month period following the issuance of the original approval for the project (or the different period set forth as a condition of approval of the project) or during the then current extension period;

2. Circumstances beyond the applicant’s control have intervened and prevented the applicant from obtaining the issuance of a building permit for the project prior to expiration of the 24 month period (or the expiration date established as a condition of the approval) or during the then current extension period;

3. The application for the extension sets forth a reasonable and substantial factual basis for issuance of the extension;

4. There is a substantial factual basis to determine that the applicant will be able to perform the actions necessary to obtain issuance of a building permit prior to expiration of the requested extension;

5. The duration of the extension requested by the applicant is not longer than is reasonably necessary to perform the actions necessary to obtain the issuance of a building permit;

6. There have not been any significant changes in the general plan, applicable specific plan, if any, zoning, or character of the area within which the project is located that would cause the approved project to become inconsistent, incompatible, or nonconforming therewith; and

7. The granting of an extension shall not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.

D. If a completed application for an extension is properly filed with the director prior to the date the approval will lapse (i.e., expire) and legal advertising/scheduling constraints preclude the city from acting on the request prior to the expiration date, the city will take action on the extension request as expeditiously as possible. The applicant’s filing of an application for the extension will toll the expiration of the approval as of the date the application is filed with the city. The application for the extension will remain in effect while pending action by the city on the request, and the issuance of an extension will relate back to the date the application for the extension was filed. While the application for an extension is pending the city will not process any related building or grading plans for the project that is the subject of the approval for which an application for extension has been submitted.

E. None of the provisions of this section shall apply to city or city-sponsored projects. (Ord. 491 § 3, 2018; Ord. 407 § 2, 2009; Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.72.120 Enforcement and penalties.

A. Purpose. It is the intent of the city council in the adoption of this section to specify its concerns and responsibilities regarding developments or actions contrary to the purpose, intent and established regulations of this title. This title serves to implement the general plan which, concurrent with these zoning regulations and title, expresses the concerns of the citizens for the vision of place and community of Solana Beach.

In order to progress to and maintain that vision, it is the city council’s determination to vigorously enforce this title consistent with the procedures contained in Chapter 1.16 SBMC pertaining to general penalties.

Actions that may be taken against violators of this title include requiring restoration of property to its original condition to include removal of structures, fines, and possible imprisonment as may be determined necessary through any judicial proceedings.

Therefore, the enforcement of the provisions of this title shall be diligently pursued in order to provide for their effective administration, to ensure compliance with any conditions of approval, to promote the city’s planning efforts and for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the city.

B. Responsibility. The department of community development shall be responsible for enforcing the conditions and standards imposed on all permits granted by the city and permitted under this title. Any structure or use which is established, operated, erected, moved, altered, enlarged, or maintained, contrary to the provisions of this title, is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance and shall be subject to the remedies and penalties set forth in Chapter 1.16 SBMC in addition to all applicable revocation procedures. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)


17.72.130 Revocation of permits.

A. The council may hold a hearing to revoke or modify any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 17.68 SBMC (Permits and Variances). Ten days prior to the hearing, notice shall be delivered in writing to the applicant and/or owner of the property for which such permit was granted. Notice shall be deemed delivered two days after being mailed, first class postage paid, to the owner as shown on the current tax rolls of the county of San Diego, and/or the project applicant.

B. A permit may be revoked or modified by the council if any of the following findings can be made:

1. That circumstances have changed so that one or more of the findings contained in Chapter 17.68 SBMC (Permits and Variances) can no longer be made;

2. That the permit was obtained by misrepresentation or fraud;

3. That the use for which the permit was granted had ceased or was suspended for 180 or more consecutive calendar days;

4. That one or more of the conditions of the permit have not been met;

5. That the use is in violation of any statute, ordinance, law, or regulation; or

6. That the use permitted by the permit is detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or constitutes a nuisance. (Ord. 185 § 2, 1993)

17.78.010  Purpose and intent.

This chapter establishes the procedures for initiating and considering amendments to the Solana Beach general plan, or any element thereof, and implements Section 4.3 of the introduction to the Solana Beach general plan which limits the number of general plan amendments permitted each year. The procedures established by this chapter supplement the procedures and requirements for general plan amendments established by Article 6 of Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 3 of the State Government Code, commencing with Section 65350. (Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.020  Limit on number of amendments permitted each year.

Each general plan element may be amended no more than twice per year, except for amendments necessary to comply with state or federal law, or to implement or obtain certification of a local coastal plan, and except for amendments specified in Government Code Section 65358, subsections (c) and (d). For the purposes of this section, a variety of separate changes, deletions, additions or modifications to a general plan element text or maps made by a single resolution shall be deemed to constitute a single amendment. The city council may consider the separate changes, deletions, additions or modifications individually or in any combination, and may separately approve, approve with amendments or deny for inclusion in the resolution of amendment each such change, deletion, addition or modification. When appropriate, the provisions of the resolution affecting separate parcels or elements shall be made severable in order to permit separate legal review or referendum of certain amendments without affecting the remainder of the amendments, if any. (Ord. 216 § 1, 1996; Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.030  Vote required for certain general plan amendments.

A. Notwithstanding anything in Section 65356 of the Government Code to the contrary, any amendment to, or repeal and readoption of, the land use element (including the land use map) shall be subject to SBMC 17.78.035.

B. Notwithstanding anything in Section 65356 of the Government Code to the contrary, any amendment to, or repeal and readoption of, any other element requiring an amendment to the land use element in order to maintain internal consistency between the various elements of the general plan shall be subject to SBMC 17.78.035. (Ord. 276 § 1 , 2002; Ord. 228 § 1, 1997; Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.035 General plan amendments and specific plan adoptions or changes.

A. No general plan amendment, including specific plan adoptions or changes, shall be adopted which would:

1. Change, alter or increase the general plan residential land use categories; or 

2. Change any land use designation to any other, except changes to land already designated residential that clearly result in a reduction in intensity or density of said land use designated as residential;

unless and until such action is approved by a majority of voters in the city.

B. This provision shall not apply to amendments which are necessary to comply with state or federal law or which are necessary to implement or obtain certification of the local coastal program. (Ord. 276 § 1 , 2002)


17.78.040  City council action. 

A. City council action approving, conditionally approving or denying a proposed general plan amendment shall be taken by resolution. Such resolutions shall be effective 30 days following their adoption. 

B. Where applicable, the entire project package, including all necessary legislative and adjudicative actions, will come to the city council as a package. The city council should consider the general plan amendment as a threshold issue. If the city council does not want to change the general plan, it can deny the general plan amendment and deny the rest of the permit applications as inconsistent with the general plan. 

If the city council is in favor of changing the general plan as proposed, it can vote to approve the change and put the general plan amendment on the ballot. The city council may then move on to the remaining permit requests. Any approval or conditional approval would be contingent upon a vote of the citizens approving a change to the general plan. No action would be taken by the city council after the public vote. (Ord. 276 § 1 , 2002; Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.050  Initiation. 

Amendments to the Solana Beach general plan, or any element thereof, may be initiated in the following manner: 

A. Amendments to the land use designation for property, or to other aspects of the general plan affecting the use or development of property, may be initiated by the owner of the property or by the owner’s authorized agent by the filing of an application for a general plan amendment (GPA) as prescribed in this chapter. If the application is filed with respect to more than one parcel of property, then the owners of each parcel, or their agents, must join in the application. If a parcel has more than one owner, then all of the owners, or their agents, must join in the application.

B. Any registered voter of the city, other than an owner or an owner’s agent eligible to initiate a general plan amendment pursuant to subsection A, may petition the city council to initiate a general plan amendment. After a public hearing, 10 days’ prior notice of which is given by first class mail to the owner or owners of the property directly affected by the amendment (if any) as shown on the latest assessment roll and by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, the city council may grant or deny the petition. If the petition is granted, the city council may either authorize the petitioner to file an application in the manner specified in SBMC 17.78.060 for owner-initiated amendments at the petitioner’s expense, or may direct the city manager to initiate the amendment at city expense. Petitions for initiation of a general plan amendment shall be filed with the department of community development within the time limit specified by SBMC 17.78.070.

C. The city manager, or the manager’s designee, with or without prior direction from the city council, and without the necessity for an application or a petition, may propose a general plan amendment at any time. An amendment initiation by the manager or the manager’s designee may be combined with amendments initiated by property owners or by petition. Nothing in this section shall preclude the proposal of a general plan amendment directly by the voters through an initiative. (Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.060  Application. 

When required or authorized pursuant to SBMC 17.78.020, applications for general plan amendments shall be filed in compliance with the requirements of this section.

A. Applications shall be filed with the department of community development on a form prescribed by the director.

B. In addition to the information required by the application form, the director may require the applicant to submit additional information as the director deems necessary for the complete review and analysis of the proposed amendment. If additional information is required, the application shall not be declared or deemed complete until the additional information is provided.

C. The application shall be accompanied by complete information as required by the director pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act and SBMC Title 18 or as deemed necessary by the director to allow the director to prepare an initial study, unless the director determines that the proposal is accepted for environmental review or qualifies for an exemption.

D. The application shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount established by city council resolution. Notwithstanding Government Code Section 66016, the city council may require applicants for general plan amendments to deposit with the department an amount equal to the estimated cost of preparing the amendment, including without limitation the cost of applicable environmental review or analysis by special consultants. The application shall not be complete and shall not be processed until the fee or deposit is paid. If the actual cost of processing the application is more than the fee or the deposit, an additional fee or deposit may be required.

E. An application for a general plan amendment may be filed and processed concurrently with an application for a specific plan, zone change, tentative subdivision or parcel map or any other permit (except a permit to grade or build) required for development. If the director determines that a specific plan, zone change, tentative subdivision or parcel map or other permit (except a permit to grade or build) is required for the development of property which is the subject of a general plan amendment, the director may require the concurrent filing and processing of the applications. (Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.070  Time limitation. 

In each calendar year, general plan amendments, if any, subject to the twice-a-year limitation cycle of SBMC 17.78.020 shall be scheduled for the public hearing in March and September. The city manager, or his designee, may establish, by written policy, application requirements, deadlines for the submission of applications, and other policies for the processing and review of applications consistent with state statute and this chapter. (Ord. 216 § 2, 1996; Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.080  Public hearing. 

Notice of public hearings required by this chapter shall be given as prescribed by SBMC 17.72.030 (Public Hearing and Notice Requirements), unless otherwise provided in this chapter or authorized by state statute. (Ord. 207 § 1, 1995)


17.78.090 Separate public hearings – Limitation on resubmission after denial.

A. The director may schedule public hearings on amendments affecting different parcels at different times during the year upon completion of the appropriate environmental review. If, after the public hearing, the city council determines to deny the proposed amendment, it may do so at that time. The decision to deny the proposed amendment shall be final at that time. If the city council determines to approve the proposed amendment, it may indicate its preliminary approval, but the decision shall not be final until adoption of a resolution at one of the twice-a-year general plan amendment meetings.

B. If a proposed general plan amendment is denied, it may not be reconsidered until the following calendar year after the filing of the appropriate application and payment of fees. (Ord. 216 § 3, 1996)

17.80.010 Purpose and intent.

A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Solana Beach does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

B. Findings of Fact.

1. The flood hazard areas of the city of Solana Beach are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

2. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.

C. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publically and privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

1. Protect human life and health;

2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

7. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions;

8. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

9. Minimize property damage.

D. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas;

6. These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes. (Ord. 418 § 1, 2010; Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.010)


17.80.020 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. Whenever the following words or phrases are used in this chapter, they shall have the meanings established by this section:

“A zone.” See “special flood hazard area.”

“Accessory structure” means a structure that may either be attached to or detached from a principal structure on the same lot, but which is incidental to the principal building, and not designed for human habitation.

“Accessory use” means a use that is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

“Alluvial fan” means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone- or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

“Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and areas of channelized or velocity flow may be evident.

“Area of special flood hazard.” See “special flood hazard area.”

“Area of special flood-related erosion hazard” is the area subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area is designated as zone E on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM).

“Area of special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard” means the area subject to severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as zone M on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM).

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “100-year flood”).

“Base flood elevation” (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as zone V1-V30, VE, or V.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

“Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain that may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the city.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: (1) the overflow of floodwaters; (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition.

“Flood boundary and floodway map” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of flood hazard and the floodway.

“Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the FIRM, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. (See definition of “flooding.”)

“Floodplain administrator” means city engineer. (See SBMC 17.80.110.)

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain management regulations” means the applicable provisions of the code or ordinances of the city relating to subdivisions, building, health, grading and erosion control, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization,” as related to SBMC 17.80.200, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city of Solana Beach will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to the water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Governing body” is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

“Hardship” as related to SBMC 17.80.200 means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city of Solana Beach requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure that is:

1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

“Mobile home” or “manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Mobile home park or subdivision” or “manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent.

“New construction” means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the city.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the city.

“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

“One-hundred-year flood” means a flood that has a one percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the “base flood,” which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

“Person” means an individual or his agent, firm, partnership, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups or this state or its agencies or political subdivision.

“Primary frontal dune” means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope.

“Program deficiency” means a defect in a community’s floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations.

“Public safety and nuisance,” as related to SBMC 17.80.200, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle that is:

1. Built on a single chassis;

2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3. Designed to be self propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with the state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

“Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area having special flood or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHB or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, V1-V30, VE or V.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a mobile home or manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means:

1. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

a. Before the improvement or repair is started; or

b. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

2. The term does not include either:

a. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

b. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management resolutions. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. (Ord. 484 § 3, 2018; Ord. 418 § 2, 2010; Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.020) 


17.80.030 Lands to which this chapter applies.

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards within the city and designated on the city zoning map as within the flood damage prevention overlay zone (“FDPO zone”). (Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.030) 


17.80.040 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

The areas of special flood hazard, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled the “Flood Insurance Study for the City of Solana Beach,” dated June 3, 1988, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map, on file with the city clerk and the city engineer, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This flood insurance study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. (Ord. 418 § 3, 2010; Ord. 92 § 2, 1989; Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.040)


17.80.050 Compliance required.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, expanded, converted, altered or developed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter, by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of any conditions imposed upon development and safeguards established in connection with those conditions), shall constitute a misdemeanor and, in addition, shall constitute a public nuisance. (Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.050)


17.80.060 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another chapter, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.060) 


17.80.070 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed to effectuate the purpose and intent; and 

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other applicable provision of the code or ordinances of this city or to conflict with any state or federal statutes. (Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.070)


17.80.080 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. By adoption of this chapter, the city does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.080)


17.80.090 Development permit required.

A. In addition to any other development permits or approvals required by this code, a flood damage prevention development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards or areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) established by SBMC 17.80.040. Application for a permit shall be made on forms approved by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

1. Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; in zone AO, elevation of highest adjacent grade and proposed elevation of lowest floor of all structures;

2. Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure will be floodproofed;

3. All appropriate certifications listed in SBMC 17.80.120(C); and

4. Description and substantiating calculations of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

B. No other permit or approval for development shall be issued unless either a flood damage prevention development permit has first been issued or such other permit or approval is conditioned upon the successful issuance of a flood damage prevention development permit.

C. Appeals. The city council of the city of Solana Beach shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. (Ord. 484 § 4, 2018; Ord. 418 § 4, 2010; Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.100)


17.80.100 Designation of floodplain administrator.

The city engineer is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting, conditionally granting, or denying flood damage prevention development permits in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.110)


17.80.110 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.

The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

A. Permit Review.

1. Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;

2. All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

4. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, “adversely affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot;

5. All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition;

B. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

2. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff;

C. Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with SBMC 17.80.030, the floodplain administrator will obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer SBMC 17.80.120. Any such information shall be submitted to the city for adoption;

D. Whenever a Watercourse Is to Be Altered or Relocated.

1. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources and the Army Corps of Engineers prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration;

2. Request that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained;

3. Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations.

a. Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

b. All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

Such submissions are necessary so that, upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data;

4. Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits;

E. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the certifications and reports required by SBMC 17.80.120, 17.80.140 and 17.80.160;

F. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards or areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow), for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary may appeal any decision regarding the interpretation to the city council as provided in SBMC 17.80.190;

G. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in SBMC 17.80.040. (Ord. 418 § 5, 2010; Ord. 92 § 3, 1989; Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.120)


17.80.120 Standards of construction.

Construction in all areas of special flood hazards shall comply with the standards set forth in this section.

A. Anchoring.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

2. All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of SBMC 17.80.150.

B. Construction Materials and Methods.

1. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

3. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

4. Within zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures shall be shown on the grading plans and required as a condition of the grading permit.

C. Elevation and Floodproofing.

Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

2. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure in zone AO shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

3. New construction and substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure shall either be elevated in conformance with subsection (C)(1) or (2) of this section or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, meet the following requirements:

a. Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

4. In all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and storage. Building plans meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect or conform to the following minimum criteria:

a. Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; or

A. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 

B. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

E. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

F. An applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory floor elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. (Ord. 70 § 1, 1988; 1987 Code § 14.100.210)

For the purpose of this section, if written notification is mailed, delivery shall be the date of mailing. 

B. The city council shall hear the appeal no later than the second regularly scheduled meeting following the filing of the appeal and may approve or disapprove the decision. The decision of the city council shall be noticed in the manner provided in SBMC 18.04.070 as appropriate and shall be mailed to the applicant and the appellant. The time for the council to hear the appeal may be extended by the city council for good cause. 

C. Notice of the city council hearing on appeal shall be given as provided for the noticing of negative declarations and by first class mail to the applicant and the appellant. 

D. The decision of the city council shall be final. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.080) 


18.04.090 Notice of exemption. 

A. When a project qualifies for an exception or exemption and the city approves or determines to carry out the project, the director, or other appropriate department head, may file a notice of exemption with the county clerk. Such notice shall include a description of the project, the location and the finding that the project is within an exception or exemption and a brief statement of the reasons for the finding. These notices may be filed weekly. 

B. Whenever the city approves an applicant’s project, the applicant may file a notice of exemption. The notice of exemption, filed by the applicant, shall contain the information required in subsection A of this section, together with a certified document issued by the city stating that it has found the project to be exempt. This may be a certified copy of the determination made according to SBMC 18.04.070 or of the resolution approving the project. 

C. The notices of exemption shall contain the information and be in the form required by State Public Resources Code Section 21151 (b). (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.090) 


18.04.100 Initial study. 

A. If the project is not categorically exempt and does not qualify for an exception, the director shall conduct an initial study to determine if the project may have a significant effect on the environment. The responsible city department or a private applicant for a city entitlement shall submit to the director a completed environmental impact assessment form as an aid to the determination. The director may require an expanded initial study when necessary to determine whether the project will have a significant effect on the environment. The expanded initial study shall not be used as a substitute for an environmental impact report. 

B. The director, with assistance from the city departments or staff, as appropriate, shall review each project for which an initial study form has been filed. The director shall evaluate all information regarding the project and shall determine whether or not the project as proposed may involve a significant impact on the environment. 

C. Except as otherwise provided by law, if it is determined that a project may have a significant impact on the environment, the director shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, an EIR according to the requirements of this chapter. 

D. If it is determined that the project will have no significant impact on the environment, the director shall prepare a negative declaration. 

E. If significant effects on the environment identified in the initial study can be mitigated so that the project will have no significant effect on the environment, the project applicant may revise or redesign the project to mitigate these effects. If the director finds that the project as revised or redesigned will have no significant impact on the environment, the director may then issue a negative declaration for the project subject to appropriate conditions to assure that no significant impact will result; provided, however, that no step or element of the project which may have a significant effect on the environment may be implemented or carried out unless the conditions intended to mitigate that effect have been implemented or carried out. The revisions or redesign shall occur prior to public notice of the negative declaration. 

F. The applicant, and any interested party who has requested notice, shall be given written notice of the director’s determination under this chapter. Such notification may be given either by personal delivery or first class mail. The applicant, or other interested party, may appeal the director’s determination to the city council within 10 calendar days after either the personal delivery or mailing of the notice. The hearing shall be processed according to the procedures established in SBMC 18.04.070 for hearing on determinations of exceptions. The decision of the city council shall be final. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.100) 


18.04.110 Consultation during initial study. 

Prior to determining whether a negative declaration or EIR is necessary for a project, the director shall consult with responsible agencies. This consultation may be quick and informal. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.110) 


18.04.120 Public notice of preparation. 

A. In order to insure adequate public participation in the environmental process, public notice of the preparation of negative declarations and EIRs may be given prior to the completion of the declaration or draft of the EIR. The director may establish guidelines for determining those projects which may require public notice of preparation. The director shall determine when such notice shall be given. Notice of preparation may be given by publishing once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the project is located and mailing to all persons who have previously requested such notice. All notices of preparation shall be posted in a public portion of City Hall. This notice is additional to all other notices. 

B. Prior to completing a negative declaration or draft EIR, the director may consult directly with any person or organization he believes will be concerned with the environmental effects of the project. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.120) 


18.04.130 Negative declaration. 

A. The director shall prepare a negative declaration if the project qualifies for a negative declaration under the provisions of this chapter. The declaration shall include a statement that comments on the declaration may be made. 

B. Notice that a negative declaration has been prepared shall be given to the public at least 10 days prior to the final adoption by the decision making body of the negative declaration, and shall also be given to all organizations and individuals who have previously requested such notice. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.130) 


18.04.140 Appeal of negative declaration. 

A. If the decision making body has the authority under this code to finally approve or deny a project, the decision to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove a negative declaration is final unless: 

1. Any interested party files an appeal to the city council of the project as provided by this code for appeals of projects; 

2. Any interested party appeals to the city council the approval of the negative declaration in writing filed with the city clerk within 10 days of the decision making body’s approval of the negative declaration. 

B. A fee established according to this chapter shall be paid to the city clerk at the time of filing the appeal. 

C. If an appeal is of the project, notice shall be given as provided in city ordinance for appeals of the project. If the appeal is of the negative declaration alone, the clerk shall give a notice of hearing in the manner specified in Section 15072 of the state guidelines not later than 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall also be mailed to the applicant and the appellant. 

D. The city council shall hear the appeal and may approve, modify or disapprove the decision of the decision making body. The decision of the city council is final. For the purpose of this section, appeal of the decision on the project shall be deemed an appeal of the decision on the negative declaration as well. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.140) 


18.04.150 Lead agency. 

A. If the director determines that a project is to be carried out or approved by one or more public agencies in addition to the city, he shall first determine which entity will be the lead agency. 

B. If the director determines that the city is the lead agency, the project shall be processed in accordance with the terms of this chapter. 

C. If the director determines that another public agency is the lead agency, the environmental documents prepared by such agency shall be the environmental documentation for the city. Such documents shall be considered by the city prior to acting upon or approving the project, and the acting or approving authority shall certify as a part of their decision that the information contained therein was reviewed and considered. A project processed in accord with subsection C of this section shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 

D. Whenever the city is a responsible agency, the director shall provide the information and responses to the lead agency which the director deems necessary in order to comply with the statutory responsibilities of a responsible agency. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.150) 


18.04.160 Prior compliance. 

If the director determines that an EIR or negative declaration has been certified for a project in connection with some previously issued entitlement, then the prior environmental document shall be sufficient to comply with this chapter unless subsequent or supplemental environmental review is required pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.160) 


18.04.170 Preparation of environmental impact report. 

Environmental impact reports shall be prepared by the director for all city projects. The applicant for city entitlement for any private project may prepare and submit a preliminary EIR to the director. The director may, but is not required to, adopt the applicant’s submittal as the document to be circulated for public review, or may use all or any part of the applicant’s submittal as a basis for an environmental impact report prepared by or for the city. The director may require the applicant to submit additional information necessary for a full and complete report. The director may call for assistance from other departments, other governmental entities and the public as he determines necessary for a full and complete report. The director may, with the approval of the city manager, enter into a contract with private consultants for the preparation of a draft EIR. The cost for such consultants shall be paid by the applicant. The consultant shall not be an employee or affiliate of the applicant. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.170) 


18.04.180 Responsibilities of director regarding draft environmental impact report. 

The draft EIR shall contain substantially the same information as a final EIR. The director shall consult with and obtain comments from other public agencies having jurisdiction by law with respect to the project. The director should also consult with any person having special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved. The director shall maintain a listing of local, state and federal agencies which have jurisdiction by law with respect to various projects and project locations within the city. A list of local agencies or persons with special expertise or concerns with regard to such projects shall also be maintained. Copies of the draft report shall be submitted for comment to all agencies having jurisdiction by law over the project. Copies of the draft report may also be submitted for comment to other agencies and persons as the director determines to be necessary to a full and complete report. If any public agency or person consulted failed to comment within the time specified by the city for such comment, or within a reasonable time, it shall be assumed such agency or person has no comment to make and such fact may be included in the final report. The draft report shall be mailed to the applicant and a copy shall be available to the public at the planning department. A copy shall also be furnished to and made available at the city clerk’s office. The public copy shall be available for 30 days after the publication of the notice of completion. The director may, in exceptional cases, extend the period of public availability when such action is necessary for a full and complete report. The director will accept written comments on, or objections to, the draft report during the period of public availability. After the expiration of said period, the director shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, the final EIR. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.180) 


18.04.190 Notice of completion. 

A. As soon as a draft of the EIR is completed, the director shall file a notice of completion with the secretary for the resources agency. At the same time, the notice of completion shall be posted in a public portion of City Hall. In addition, notice shall be given to all organizations and individuals who have previously requested such notice, and shall also be given by at least one of the following procedures: 

1. Publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city; 

2. Posting on and off site in the area where the project is located; 

3. Direct mailing to owners of property as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll within a radius of 300 feet of the proposed project. 

B. The director may require any additional notice he deems necessary for the project and shall assess the cost to the applicant in lieu of public notice as specified in this section. The notice required by this section may be given in the same manner and at the same time as the public notice otherwise required for the project. This shall not relieve the director from the obligation to post the notice on the bulletin board and send the notice to organizations and persons previously requesting such notice. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.190) 


18.04.200 Final environmental impact report. 

The final EIR shall include the draft EIR, a section listing the organizations and persons consulted, the comments received, either verbatim or in summary, and the response of the director to the significant environmental points raised in the review and consultation process. The response of the director may be in the form of a revision of the draft EIR or an attachment thereto describing the disposition of the significant points raised. The major issues raised when the position of the director is at variance with the comments shall be addressed in detail, and the reasons why any specific comments and suggestions were not accepted shall be stated. The city council may, by resolution, prescribe guidelines in addition to the requirements of this section for the contents of the EIR. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.200) 


18.04.210 City council hearing. 

A. Upon completion of the comment period, the director shall cause the EIR to be set for public hearing by the city council. Notice of the public hearing shall be given as follows: 

1. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed or delivered, at least 10 days prior to the hearing, to the owner of the subject real property, the owner’s duly authorized agent, or to the project applicant. This provision shall apply only to noncity projects. 

2. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed or delivered at least 10 days prior to the hearing to each local agency expected to provide water, sewage, streets, schools or other essential facilities or services to the project and whose ability to provide those facilities or services may be significantly affected by the project. 

3. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed or delivered at least 10 days prior to the hearing to all owners of real property as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll within 300 feet of the real property that is the subject of the hearing. In lieu of utilizing the assessment roll, records of the county assessor or tax collector which contain more recent information than the assessment roll may be used. If the number of owners to whom notice would be mailed or delivered pursuant to this subparagraph is greater than 500, in lieu of mailed or delivered notice, the director may permit notice to be given by placing a display advertisement of at least one-eighth page in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 10 days prior to the hearing. 

4. If the notice is mailed or delivered pursuant to subparagraph 3, the notice shall also either be: 

a. Published, pursuant to Government Code Section 6061, in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 10 days prior to the hearing; or 

b. Posted at least 10 days prior to the hearing in at least three public places in the city. 

5. The failure of any person or entity to receive notice given pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute grounds for any court to invalidate the action for which the notice is given. If a decision making body receives substantial evidence that notice has not been given as required by this chapter, then the decision making body may continue the matter for hearing after proper notice has been given. 

6. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide addressed and stamped envelopes for the mailed notice and to pay the cost of all notice given pursuant to this section. 

B. If the hearings on the EIR will be consolidated according to this chapter with public hearings on other approvals of the project, the notice required by this section may be given in the same manner, and at the same time, as public notice otherwise required for the project. At the hearing, the city council shall hear staff comments on the report, refer it back to staff for further investigation, information and analysis, and for the inclusion of additional material if they determine such to be necessary to a full and complete report. The report shall be supplemented to include any significant points raised at the hearing and not covered in the report. If the city council finds that the report has been completed in compliance with CEQA, the state guidelines and this chapter, it shall, by motion, so certify. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.210) 


18.04.220 Consolidation. 

The city council may consolidate a hearing on an EIR or consideration of the negative declaration with any other hearing held by the city council in regard to the same project. In such case the city council shall review and consider the information contained in the report before taking action on other aspects of the project. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.220) 


18.04.230 Standard of review. 

A. In considering whether or not to approve a project for which an EIR is required and has been prepared, the city council shall first review and consider the information contained in the report. The report is an informational document prepared to inform the decision makers and the general public of the environmental effects of the projects they propose to carry out or approve. The process is intended to enable the city to: 

1. Evaluate a project to determine whether it may have a significant effect on the environment; 

2. Examine and institute methods of reducing adverse impacts; and 

3. Consider alternatives to the project as proposed. These things must be done prior to approval or disapproval of the project. 

B. An EIR may not be used as an instrument to rationalize approval of a project; nor do indications of adverse impact, as enunciated in an EIR, require that a project be disapproved. While it is the express policy of the city to give major consideration to preventing environmental damage, it is recognized that the city also has obligations to balance other public objectives, including economic and social factors, in determining whether and how a project should be approved. In that regard, the city council may balance environmental objectives with economic and social objectives in arriving at a decision. In evaluating whether or not to approve the project, or to grant the permit, license or other entitlement applied for in connection with the report, the city council shall weigh any adverse environmental effects against any positive effects and any benefit to the city and the public which could result from the proposed project. The city council may disapprove a project if it finds that the adverse consequences outweigh the positive aspects of the project. The city council may approve a project if they find the reverse to be true. The city council may also conditionally approve or modify the project in consideration of the information in the report. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.230) 


18.04.240 Required findings – Mitigation measures. 

A. If the EIR for a project identifies one or more significant effects, the project shall not be approved or carried out unless the city council makes one or more of the following written findings or statements for each significant effect (a statement of facts supporting each finding shall also be made): 

1. Changes or alterations have been required on, or incorporated into, the project and which mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects as identified on the EIR. 

2. The mitigation measures are within the responsibility or jurisdiction of another public agency. 

3. Specific economic, social or other considerations make infeasible mitigation measures or project alternatives. 

B. If the project will be approved or carried out and a significant environmental effect will not be reduced to an acceptable level, the city council shall make a statement of overriding considerations which shall be mentioned in the notice of determination and shall include the following written findings or statements: 

1. The reasons which support its action, based on the final EIR or other information on the record or a combination of both; 

2. Any findings or statements required under subsection A of this section. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.240) 


18.04.250 Consideration of environmental documents. 

In considering whether or not to approve a project for which a negative declaration has been processed, a determination of exemption, exception or prior compliance made, or any other environmental document issued which results in an endorsement of compliance pursuant to this chapter, the city council shall first review and consider such document and all the information contained therein. The standard of review prescribed in SBMC 18.04.230 for evaluation of EIRs shall be applied. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.250) 


18.04.260 Notice of determination. 

A. Within five working days after the city council approves or determines to carry out a project or grants a requested entitlement for which a negative declaration or EIR has been prepared, the director shall file a notice of determination with the county clerk. 

B. When a notice of determination is returned by the county clerk after the required posting period, the director may make the notice a part of the project file or may forward the notice to the appropriate custodian of the project file for placement in the file. 

C. The notice of determination shall contain the information and be substantially in the form required by State Public Resources Code Section 21152(a). (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.260) 


18.04.270 Monitoring of mitigation measures. 

Whenever a project is approved subject to mitigation measures, including measures incorporated into the project design or imposed as a condition of approval, the decision making body shall establish a program to monitor the implementation of the mitigation measures. The project applicant shall be responsible for the cost of the monitoring program. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.270) 


18.04.280 Review of lead agency environmental impact reports. 

When a lead agency submits an EIR to the city for comment, it shall be referred to the director. The director is responsible for reviewing the report, preparing appropriate comments and forwarding any such comments to the lead agency within the indicated time limits. The director may consult with and obtain input from any person with knowledge or expertise regarding the matter. As part of the review, the director shall focus on the sufficiency of the EIR in discussing possible impacts upon the environment, ways in which adverse effects might be mitigated, and alternatives to the project, in light of the intent of CEQA to provide decision makers with useful information about such factors. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.280) 


18.04.290 Requests for environmental documents. 

The director shall make EIRs or other environmental documents available for reasonable public inspection. A charge no greater than the actual cost of reproduction shall be paid for by any person requesting copies. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.290) 


18.04.300 Retention of public comment. 

Comments received from other agencies or individuals in the course of the consultation process while preparing an EIR shall be kept for a reasonable time in the City Hall. They shall be made available to the public, subject to the same terms as other environmental documents. Comments regarding any project received independently of the report review process shall also be considered and kept on file. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.300) 


18.04.310 Cost of reports – Fee schedule. 

The city council may, by resolution, adopt a fee schedule for the processing of projects subject to this chapter and for the processing of any report or appeal thereunder. In the event city staff is unable to prepare an EIR, the director may cause the same to be prepared and the actual cost shall be collected from the applicant. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.310) 


18.04.320 Mailing of notice on request – Clerk. 

The city clerk shall mail, on a continuing basis, copies of all notices of appeal, notices of hearings and other notices resulting from this chapter to any individual or group who files a written request therefor. Such requests shall be made annually. A fee in an amount established by city council resolution shall accompany each such request. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.320) 


18.04.330 Mailing of notice on request – City. 

The director shall mail a copy of any negative declarations on a continuing basis to any individual or group so requesting in writing. Such requests shall be made annually and shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount established by city council resolution. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.330)

A. “Community development director,” as used in this chapter, means the community development director of the city or the director’s designated representative. 

B. The director may approve the designation of a private consultant hired by the city to act for the director for a particular project, except that the director shall retain all final decision making authority vested in the director by this chapter. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.340) 


18.04.350 Guidelines. 

The city council may adopt, by resolution, additional guidelines to aid in the implementation of this title. These guidelines may include, but are not limited to, guidelines for preparation of draft and final EIRs, a form which will solicit sufficient information to allow the director to determine if a project may have a significant effect on the environment, and guidelines for mandatory finds of significant effect. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.350) 


18.04.360 Notices of other hearings. 

Except as provided in SBMC 18.04.210, notice of any other public hearings required by this chapter shall be given by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation at least 10 days before the hearing. (Ord. 88 § 1, 1989; 1987 Code § 12.04.360) 1
