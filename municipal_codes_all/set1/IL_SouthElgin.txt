      (4)   The passage of all ordinances, for whatever purpose, and
of any resolution or motion to create any liability against the village, or
for the expenditure or appropriation of village money shall require the

Plan, which has been reviewed and certified by the county, is hereby adopted

Emergency Operations Plan and to maintain, with the county, the certified
status of the Comprehensive Emergency Operations Plan.



   (C)   Amendment.  All future amendments to the Comprehensive
Emergency Operations Plan, as such may be adopted by the corporate
authorities of the county, are hereby made a part of the village’s
Comprehensive Emergency Operations Plan effective upon their adoption by the
county.

proves by a preponderance of the evidence that such tenant or occupant is the

continuance.

      (1)   The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for
immobilizing any eligible vehicle, as defined in division (B) below, by
placement of a restraint in such a manner as to prevent its operation.



      (2)   If the eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation
of any provision of the traffic code for which such vehicle is subject to an
immediate tow, or in any place where it constitutes an obstruction or hazard,
or where it impedes village workers during such operations as snow removal,
the Code Administrator may cause the eligible vehicle immediately to be:



         (a)   Towed to a vehicle pound; or



         (b)   Relocated to a legal parking place and there
restrained.

more final determinations of parking violation liability for which the fines

sent as prescribed in this chapter.

      (3)   A person may challenge the validity of the notice of
impending vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and appearing in
person to submit evidence that would conclusively disprove eligibility.



      (4)   Such hearing shall not be a forum to re-adjudicate or
collaterally attack the findings of fact and law issued by the Hearing
Officer.



      (5)   Upon a request for a hearing, the Code Administrator
shall schedule the hearing for the next regular hearing date.

liability shall be based on the following grounds:



         (a)   That all fines and penalties for the parking
violations cited in the notice have been paid in full; or



         (b)   That the registered owner has not accumulated five
or more final determinations of parking violation liability that were unpaid
at the time the notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued.



   (C)   Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be
affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.

village or any village ordinance that requires, after notice, the cutting of

vehicles, or the abatement of nuisances from private property, the owner
shall be prima facie responsible for the violation and subject to the penalty
therefor.



   (B)   Whenever any property is determined by a Code Enforcement
Officer to be in violation of any village ordinance, law, housing or building
code or zoning ordinance that establishes construction, plumbing, heating,
electrical, fire prevention, sanitation or other health and safety standards
that are applicable to structures in the village or any village ordinance
that requires, after notice, the cutting of weeds, the removal of garbage and
debris. the removal of inoperable motor vehicles, or the abatement of
nuisances from private property, the Code Enforcement Officer or other
designated member of the Community Development Department or other person
designated by the Code Administrator observing such violation may issue a
violation notice, and serve the notice on the owner of the property by
leaving it with any adult occupant of the property, by affixing it to the
entrance to the property in a conspicuous place, or by certified mail, return
receipt requested.



      (1)   The issuer of the notice shall:



         (a)   Specify on the notice:



            1.   The particular Code provision allegedly
violated;



            2.   The common address of the property; and



            3.   The specific location on the property, as
well as the date, time and nature of the alleged violation observed;

such violation(s) to be summarily abated; and



         (b)   Certify the correctness of the specified
information.

any time prior to hearing by bringing the property into compliance and paying
the full amount of the fine sought by the village as set forth on the face of

stipulation and admission that the violation existed and the village shall
maintain a record of such violation for two years.



   (G)   Upon a determination by the Hearing Officer that a violation
of the Village Code of Ordinances related to property has occurred, the
Hearing Officer shall request and be provided with evidence of any prior

property. Subject to the authority granted in § 32.53(A)(4)(e) to reduce or

provision that the matter remain open for final determination of the fine and
amount due.  The notice of compliance issued by the village shall constitute

compliance; however, the Hearing Officer may consider all competent and
relevant evidence proving earlier compliance.



   (I)   The Hearing Officer, in accord with § 32.53(A)(4)(e) shall
impose an assessment of enforcement costs whenever a violation is determined

§ 32.65  PERSISTENT PROPERTY VIOLATION PUBLIC NUISANCE DECLARED.



   (A)   It is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance to
permit, allow, maintain, intensify, fail to abate, or otherwise allow to
persist unchecked any condition that is the subject of a final determination
of liability by a Hearing Officer for a violation of the Village Code related
to property, as more particularly set forth in § 32.64 of the Village Code,
for a continuous period of more than seven days following the exhaustion of
or failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law (a “persistent property violation nuisance”).



   (B)   The Director of Community Development, or his or her designee,
is authorized to serve notice in writing upon the owner, occupant, lessee,
possessor or person having any control over any parcel of real estate on
which a persistent property violation nuisance exists by certified mail,
personal service, or by posting signage in a prominent place on the property,
ordering such owner, occupant, agent or person to abate such nuisance within
a specified reasonable time and in the manner prescribed (the “abatement
notice”). The abatement notice shall also advise the recipient that the
village may abate the nuisance at the recipient’s expense without further
notice if the nuisance is not abated within the specified time period. It
shall not be necessary in any case for the village to specify in the
abatement notice the manner in which any nuisance shall be abated, unless the
Director of Community Development, or his or her designee, deems it advisable
to do so. If the person so notified neglects, refuses or otherwise fails to
comply with the requirements of the abatement notice within the specified
time or within such longer time period as the Director of Community
Development, or his or her designee, may approve pursuant to the abatement
notice recipient’s timely request for extension accompanied by the
submission of a written corrective action plan, the Director of Community
Development, Chief of Police or designee of the foregoing may summarily abate
or cause the nuisance to be abated without further notice. The village’s
failure to commence nuisance abatement activities immediately upon the
expiration of the corrective period provided herein shall not constitute a
waiver of its right to commence abatement activities at any time without
further notice. The designee of the village abating or causing the nuisance
to be abated shall keep an account of the expense of abatement.



   (C)   The abatement notice issued in response to a persistent
property violation nuisance shall serve as notice advising the recipient that
the recurrence of the conditions constituting the same violation within a
24-month period following the abatement notice shall trigger the village’s
nuisance abatement measures without any further notice required.



   (D)   In addition to any other fines or penalties provided by law,
the person(s) who created, continued or suffered the persistent property
violation nuisance shall be liable to the village for all village expenses
incurred in connection with the drafting and service of the abatement notice
and in abating, remediating, repairing or removing the conditions that gave
rise to the persistent property violation nuisance. Such expenses may be
recovered in an appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction.



   (E)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the village from taking
any other enforcement action authorized by law.

to this chapter, or imposed by the Circuit Court of Kane County, or any other
lawful administrative proceeding (hereafter, “debt”) there shall be added
and imposed any and all additional fees incurred by the village to collect
such debt. The additional fees to be added for a debt referred to a debt
collection agency or attorney for collection, shall be the greater of:



   (A)   The actual fees incurred by the village to collect such debt;
or



   (B)   An amount equal to 35% of the debt.

full payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of
the due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the

(Ord. 2000-68, passed 12-18-00)



§ 37.82  INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.



   The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer
for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered; unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,

reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still
due and owing.



   (A)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than

applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.



   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year
period for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by
the village, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.

§ 37.84  VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.



   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date
of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty
for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the
taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the
taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on
the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the
part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid
and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts
owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under
this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

   Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk's office.



(Ord. 2000-68, passed 12-18-00)



§ 37.86  LIENS.



   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid,
the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to
be improper, the local tax administrator shall:



   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;



   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and



   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

subchapter shall be controlling.



(Ord. 2000-68, passed 12-18-00)

pursuant to a finding under any of the criteria of the Act.



   (E)   Although date stamped at the time of delivery by the Clerk,
the application shall be subject to further review to assure compliance with
the requirements of this subchapter concerning the content of the
application. Following receipt of the application, the Village Clerk shall
cause the publication of a black border notice stating that said application
and supporting evidence have been filed and are available in the Village
Clerk's office for public inspection. The Village Clerk shall cause such
notice to be published no later than 30 days from the date of filing.



   (F)   In order to give members of the public an opportunity to make
informed written comment and to give members of the public and the Village an
opportunity to prepare adequately and fairly for the public hearing
hereinafter described, the applicant must fully comply with all requirements
of this section and failure to submit the required information as of the date
of filing shall, absent good cause shown in the judgment of the Hearing
Officer, render such information inadmissible at the public hearing.



   (G)   At any time prior to the completion by the applicant of the
presentation of the applicant's factual evidence and opportunity for
cross-examination by the Village Board and any participants, the applicant
may file not more than one amended application containing substantive
amendments or revisions upon payment of additional fees in the sum of $25,000
unless the Village Administrator determines, in his or her sole discretion,
that funds in excess of the $25,000 are required due to the nature of the
changes of the amended application, in which case that greater amount shall
be the sum due. Upon the filing of an amended application, the time
limitations for final action by the Village Board shall be extended for an
additional period of 90 days.



   (H)   Other amendments may be made if, in the opinion of the Hearing
Officer, any such proposed amendment is not substantive and the Hearing
Officer otherwise allows such amendments.

§ 38.28  REVIEW OF APPLICATION.



   (A)   The Village Administrator ("Administrator"), together with the
assistance of Special Counsel to the Village, shall be responsible for
coordinating the review of the application by the Village staff and its
consultants and to render such reports, advice or recommendations to the
Village President and Village Board as the Administrator shall deem prudent
to assist the Village President and Village Board in making their decision.
The Administrator is authorized to call meetings and set deadlines for the
submittal of reports and recommendations in preparation for submission
through the public hearing process. The Administrator, Special Counsel, the
Village staff and the Village's consultants shall not discuss the application
or the review thereof with, nor submit reports or recommendations, to the
Village President, Village Board or the Village Attorney except in accordance
with the public hearing process set forth below.



   (B)   Should the Administrator desire to enter any reports,
testimony or other evidence into the record of the public hearing, such shall
be entered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subchapter and
such shall also be available for copying by the public upon the payment of
the actual costs of reproduction.



(Ord. 2010-29, passed 5-17-10)



§ 38.29  PARTICIPATION AND INFORMATION FROM OTHER PARTIES.



   (A)   The applicant is a participant.



   (B)   The Village is a participant.  For purposes of the Act, the
Village and its employees and staff, and any experts, consultants,
investigators or attorneys hired by the Village to review, investigate,
present at hearing, or otherwise work for the Village concerning the
petition, all constitute one participant. To the extent the Village employees
and staff wish to participate in the public hearings outside their roles or
employment with the Village, they must submit a notice of participation, as
do other members of the public.



   (C)   Any person other than described in divisions (A) and (B) of
this section, must file a written notice of participation on a form supplied
by the Village Clerk notifying the Village Clerk and counsel for the
applicant of that person's or entity's intent to participate.



      (1)   Every notice of participation must be filed with the
Village Clerk before the adjournment of the first day of public hearing. In
the case of counsel of record for any participant, said counsel shall, on or
before the 80th day from the date of filing, serve a letter upon the Village
Clerk and upon counsel for the applicant entering his or her appearance for
the participant.



      (2)   Every notice of participation shall provide the
following information: the name, address daytime phone number and, if
available, facsimile number of the participant or counsel; whether the
participant will be participating on his or her own behalf or as a
representative/spokesperson of another person or entity (and if on behalf of
another person or entity, identify the name of that person or entity);
whether the person (or the entity or association he or she represents) will
be represented by an attorney during the public hearings; and whether the
person intends on providing oral testimony or comment during the public
hearing. All members of the public who desire to present sworn testimony,
unsworn comment, or submit written questions to the Hearing Officer must file
a notice of participation.



      (3)   No person may become a participant after the first day
of the hearing except for good cause shown. The Hearing Officer shall
liberally interpret this limitation if the additional participation shall not
delay the process or unfairly prejudice a prior participant. No late
participant shall be entitled to re-call a witness who has previously
testified.



   (D)   Participant rights.  Participants have the right to present
sworn testimony and witnesses. Participants represented by counsel have the
right to cross-examine or question witnesses who provide sworn testimony.
Participants who are not represented by counsel may provide witnesses,
evidence and sworn testimony subject to cross-examination by others; provide
unsworn testimony or comment during the public hearing (subject to the
Hearing Officer's judgment and consistent with fundamental fairness); or, as
is the case for members of the public generally, submit written questions to
the Hearing Officer who, in his or her sole discretion, shall decide whether
such questions shall be posed and the manner of posing such questions.
Participants who are not represented by counsel shall not cross-examine
witnesses directly.



   (E)   Any attorneys acting as counsel and representing a participant
must be licensed and in good standing to practice law in the State of
Illinois, or if licensed and in good standing to practice law in another
state which is part of the United States, shall be allowed to serve as a
counsel for a participant upon motion made to and granted by the Hearing
Officer.



   (F)   All witnesses (other than those called purely for purposes of
rebuttal) and the subject matter on which they will testify shall be
disclosed, and all reports, studies, exhibits or other evidence, or copies
thereof, that any person, other than the applicant, desires to submit as
evidence for the record at the public hearing must be filed with the Village
Clerk and with counsel for the applicant no later than 80 days after the date
of filing of the application. In the event that the 80th day after the date
of filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the next business day
shall be considered the date by which all such information must be filed.
Copies of all such information shall also be available for copying by the
public upon the payment of the actual costs of reproduction. Evidence or
witnesses not so disclosed by the required date shall be admissible at the
hearing only where the Hearing Officer shall find that the admission of such
evidence is necessary to provide fundamental fairness to the parties.

§ 38.30  PUBLIC HEARING.



   (A)   The public hearing shall be held no sooner than 90 days from
the date of filing and shall not commence any later than 120 days from the
date of filing.  The public hearing shall be at such times and places as is
convenient for the public generally but shall be conducted so as to comply
with the statutory requirement that the Village render a decision prior to
the 180th day from the date of filing, and accounting for the 30 day period
for written comment following the close of the public hearing, with due time
for the corporate authorities to deliberate and render a decision. The
Administrator shall determine the date(s), time(s) and location(s) for the
public hearing as soon as is practical but in no event later than 30 days
after the date of filing.



   (B)   The presence of any two members of the corporate authorities,
i.e., the Board of Trustees and the Village President, shall constitute a
quorum for purposes of the hearing.



   (C)   Once determined by the Administrator, the Administrator shall
notify the applicant of the date, time and location of the public hearing and
shall request that the applicant cause notice of the public hearing to be
made as follows:



      (1)   Publish two legal notices in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the Village or Kane County. The first such notice
shall be published no sooner than 50 days from the date of filing and no
later than 60 days from the date of filing; the second such notice shall be
published no sooner than 65 days from the date of filing nor later than 75
days from the date of filing. Said notices, which may be in lower case, shall
consist of the following:



         (a)   The name and address of the applicant;



         (b)   The owners of the site and, if ownership is in a
land trust, the names of the beneficiaries of said trust;



         (c)   Legal descriptions of the property and the
facility boundary, with each depicted on a plat of survey;



         (d)   The street address of the property and, if there
is no street address for the property, a description of the site with
reference to location, ownership or occupancy or in some other manner that
will reasonably identify the property to the residents of the neighborhood;



         (e)   The nature and size of the proposed facility;



         (f)   The date of filing and the time and date of the
public hearing;



         (g)   The location of the public hearing;



         (h)   A statement that the application with all required
information is available in electronic format from the Village Clerk's office
and further that all witness lists and copies of reports and other evidence
must, absent good cause, be filed with the Village Clerk and all counsel of
record no later than the 80th day from the date of filing.



      (2)   Certified mail to all members of the Illinois General
Assembly from the district in which the proposed site is located.



      (3)   Certified mail to the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency.



      (4)   Certified mail to the County of Kane and all
municipalities or townships within one and one-half miles of the proposed
facility.



      (5)   Public hearing notice in a newspaper of general

week preceding the public hearing. Such notice shall consist of all items
described in division (B)(1) above except for division (B)(1)(c) above.



   (D)   Hearing procedures:



      (1)   The Village President shall appoint a Hearing Officer to
preside over the public hearing and the Hearing Officer shall make any
decisions concerning the admission of evidence and the manner in which the
hearing is conducted, subject to this subchapter.  The Hearing Officer shall
make all decisions and rulings in accordance with fundamental fairness. The
Hearing Officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, incompetent or unduly
repetitious testimony or other evidence. All testimony and all public
meetings concerning the petition shall be in the presence of a certified
court reporter who shall report all proceedings regarding consideration of
the petition. The Hearing Officer shall have the following powers or duties:



         (a)   Administer oaths and affirmations;



         (b)   Conduct a public meeting, prior to the start of
the public hearings, to explain the public hearing procedure and site
location review process;



         (c)   Arrange for the presence of a certified court
reporter to attend and transcribe the conduct of all public hearings for the
public record;



         (d)   Regulate the course of the hearing, including, but
not limited to, controlling the order of proceedings, consistent with this
subchapter, and to grant recesses for good cause shown. For example, good
cause may be found when issues, facts, data or other pieces of evidence arise
in the course of the hearing that were not reasonably foreseeable to the
party requesting the recess. No recess may extend past five days except due
to the availability of a suitable forum for the hearing;



         (e)   Require a witness or person presenting unsworn
public comment to state his or her position either for, against, or undecided
with respect to the proposed facility;



         (f)   Examine a witness and direct a witness to testify;



         (g)   Establish reasonable limits on the duration of
public hearing consistent with the Act and this subchapter, including but not
limited to the reasonable limitation of sworn testimony, unsworn oral
comment, direct and cross-examination of any witnesses, and the limitation of
repetitive or cumulative testimony and questioning;



         (h)   Rule upon objections and evidentiary questions,
with the understanding that such rulings must be consistent with fundamental
fairness, but need not be in strict compliance with the Illinois Supreme
Court, Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, or any local rules of evidence
governing a civil judicial trial in the State of Illinois;



         (i)   Allow the introduction of late-filed evidence, be
it written or testimonial, on behalf of any participant, provided good cause
is shown for the late-filing, the evidence is offered in and is relevant to
the rebuttal portion of the applicant's or participant's case, and evidence
was filed with the Village Clerk at least one day before the public hearing
at which it is offered, and fundamental fairness to all parties will be
preserved;



         (j)   The Hearing Officer shall be an attorney, licensed
to practice in Illinois. The Hearing Officer shall confer with the Village
Board concerning the petition, between the date of filing of the petition and
the Board's decision on the petition. Given the Hearing Officer's role of
communicating with the Village Board, the Hearing Officer may not confer with
the participants (members of the public, applicant and Village included)
concerning the petition, unless such conference takes place during the public
hearing, is through correspondence which is filed with the Village Clerk
(and, thus, available for everyone to view), or concerns location, time or
other similar scheduling aspects of the public meeting or public hearing, or
the notices for same. The only additional exception from this restriction is
that the Hearing Officer may confer with the Village Clerk about the upkeep
or status of the public record, make a request to review or copy the public
record, or confer with the Village Clerk regarding the scheduling or location
of the public meeting or hearing, or arrangements for the notices of the
public meeting and hearing;



         (k)   At the conclusion of the public hearing and after
consideration of all timely-filed written comments, the Hearing Officer shall
submit draft written findings (of law or fact) to the Village Board and file
a copy of such findings with the Village Clerk;



      (2)   The Hearing Officer does not have the right or the power
to vote, as a Village Board Member votes, on the petition.



      (3)   Conduct of the public hearing shall be substantially as
follows:

present together with the Village Attorney who is acting as counsel for the

and special counsel for the Village staff may then make an opening statement;

the applicant and/or any witnesses the applicant may wish to call. Upon the
close of the applicant's testimony, participants represented by counsel may
present sworn testimony, including any witnesses and evidence they wish to
present. Upon the close of all such testimony, the Village may present sworn
testimony, including witnesses and evidence it may wish to present. The
Hearing Officer, in the exercise of his or her discretion, may then permit
rebuttal testimony and sur-rebuttal testimony;



         (k)   All witnesses shall testify under oath and be
subject to reasonable questioning as follows: direct examination by counsel;
cross-examination by counsel for other participants or the Village staff, the
Village Board and/or the Hearing Officer (including the use of written
questions submitted by the public to the Hearing Officer); redirect
examination; re-cross examination;



         (l)   Following the testimony outlined in division (j)
above, any participant not represented by counsel that wishes to provide
sworn testimony subject to cross-examination by others may proceed;



         (m)   Following the testimony, if any, outlined in
division (l) above, any participant that has not otherwise presented
testimony may provide unsworn testimony or comment, subject to the Hearing
Officer's judgment concerning content and duration and consistent with
fundamental fairness;



         (n)   Closing statements, if any, by counsel for the
applicant, participants represented by counsel, and counsel for the Village
staff;



         (o)   Rebuttal statement, if any, by the applicant,
subject to limitations as imposed by the Hearing Officer; and



         (p)   Hearing declared closed.



      (4)   Public comment: written and oral:



         (a)   Any person has the right to file written comment
concerning the appropriateness of the proposed faculty, or its compliance
with the requirements of Section 39.2 of the Act, with the Village Clerk, at
any time after the filing of a petition and within the time limitation
provided in division (d) below.  Likewise, the applicant, Village staff, the
Village Attorney and/or any participant may file draft proposed findings of
fact within the same time limitation.



         (b)   The Village Clerk, on behalf of the Village Board,
shall receive written comment or draft findings of fact and the Clerk shall
date stamp same, shall serve copies of the same on counsel for the applicant
and counsel for the Village, Village staff and counsel of record for all
participants; and shall file written comment and the postmarked envelope in
which comment is received.



         (c)   Copies of such written comments shall be made
available for public inspection in the offices of the Village Clerk, and
members of the public shall be allowed to obtain a copy of any written
comment upon payment of actual cost of reproduction.



         (d)   Any written comment received by the Village Clerk
or postmarked not later than 30 days after the date of the last public
hearing shall be made part of the record at the public hearing as hereinafter
described and the Village Board shall consider any such timely written
comments in making its final determination concerning said petition. In the
event that the 30th day falls on a Sunday or a federal holiday, the next day
on which mail is delivered shall be considered the 30th day for purposes of
this division.



         (e)   Any person has the right to provide oral, unsworn
comment during the course of the public hearing, upon reasonable notice to
the Hearing Officer that the person desires to provide such comment and
consistent with the Hearing Officer's judgment concerning the conduct of the
hearing. All oral testimony may be submitted in written form if the Hearing
Officer so directs. This type of comment, since it is not provided under
oath, is not subject to cross-examination.



   (E)   Parte communication prohibited. In recognition of the
quasi-judicial role of the Village President and each Member of the Village
Board, and the Village Attorney, ex-parte communications with persons other
than the Village President, Board Members or the Village Attorney concerning
the application are prohibited between the date of filing and the date of the
final decision of the Village Board (or the 180th day after the date of
filing).

§ 38.32  SITING APPROVAL DECISION.



   (A)   On or before the 180th day following the date of filing, or on
or before the 270th day following the date of filing if the applicant filed
an amendment to the application in compliance with the timing requirements of
the Act, the Village Board shall, by written resolution, upon the vote of a
majority of its members, decide whether to:



      (1)   Grant the petition, without any conditions;



      (2)   Grant the petition, but with conditions on such

the purposes of Section 39.2 of the Act and are not inconsistent with the
regulations promulgated by the Illinois Pollution Control Board; or



      (3)   Deny the petition.



   (B)   In making its recommendation on the request for siting
approval, the Village Board shall base its decision on the following criteria:



      (1)   The facility is necessary to accommodate the waste needs
of the area it is intended to serve;



      (2)   The facility is so designed, located and proposed to be
operated that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;



      (3)   The facility is located so as to minimize
incompatibility with the character of the surrounding area and to minimize
the effect on the value of the surrounding property;



      (4)   The facility is located outside the boundary of the
100-year flood plain;



      (5)   The plan of operations for the facility is designed to
minimize the danger to the surrounding area from fire, spills or other
operational accidents;



      (6)   The traffic patterns to or from the facility are so
designed as to minimize the impact on existing traffic flows;



      (7)   If the facility will be treating, storing or disposing
of hazardous waste, an emergency response plan exists for the facility which
includes notification, containment and evacuation procedures to be used in
case of an accidental release;



      (8)   If a solid waste management plan was previously adopted
for Kane County prior to the filing of the petition, the facility is
consistent with that plan; and



      (9)   If the facility will be located within a regulated
recharge area, any and all applicable requirements specified by the Illinois
Pollution Control Board for such area have been met.



   (C)   In its evaluation of statutory criteria (ii) and (v) as set
forth in ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5, § 39.2, the Village Board may also consider as
evidence the previous operating experience and past record of violations and
penalties of the applicant and, if different, the owner or operator of any
solid waste or gas handling operations (and, for each, any subsidiary,
member, manager or parent corporation) in the field of solid or hazardous
waste management.



   (D)   No determination by the Village Board of a siting approval
request may be reconsidered.



   (E)   A local siting approval granted under this subchapter shall
expire at the end of two calendar years from the date upon which it was
granted, unless the local siting approval granted under this subchapter is
for a sanitary landfill operation, in which case the approval shall expire at
the end of three calendar years from the date upon which it was granted, and
unless within that period the applicant has made application to the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency for a permit to develop the site. In the
event that the local siting decision has been appealed, such expiration
period shall be deemed to begin on the date upon which the appeal process is
concluded.

§ 38.34  WAIVER OF RULES.



   (A)   In order to insure fundamental fairness, compliance with the
Act, and to protect the public interest, the Board, by majority vote of its
members, may waive any of the above rules.



   (B)   A simple majority of the Board may, prior to receipt of a
particular request hereunder, reduce the number of copies of such request, or
particular portions thereof, which must be submitted hereunder. Such
reductions may be granted upon the written motion of a person who has,
pursuant to Section 39.2(b) of the Act, filed a notice of intent to submit a
request, which notice has also stated the applicant's intention to move for a
copies reduction under this section.  Such motion must be filed with the
Clerk at least five calendar days prior to a regularly scheduled Board
meeting. The moving party must submit a certified copy of the notice of
intent, and demonstrate that: compliance with the copies requirement
hereunder will be inordinately expensive, without commensurate benefit to the
Village and the public; and that the proposed copies reduction will not work
any fundamental unfairness on the Village or the public, in their ability to
review, and prepare for the hearing on, the request. The Board shall act upon

§ 50.62 PERMITS.



   (A)   Scope of requirements. No person or contractor may perform any
of the following acts without first obtaining a permit from the village.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt any person from

      (1)   Plant, remove, trim, or otherwise disturb any tree,
shrub or stump, or any part thereof, located on village-owned property,

      (3)   Install planter boxes on village-owned property. Planter
boxes that are added after a tree has been planted can only be approximately
4"- 6" higher than the tree’s root flare. Materials added to box cannot
cover root flare or come into contact with trunk. Any plants or planter boxes
damaged in the removal or maintenance of a tree are the permit applicant’s,
and not the village’s, responsibility.



      (4)   Place on village-owned property, including right-of-way,
either above or below ground level, a container for trees or shrubs.



      (5)   Damage, cut, tap, carve or transplant any tree or shrub

or any other man-made object to any tree or shrub located on village-owned
property, including right of way.



   (B)   Issuance. Within a reasonable time after receiving a permit
application, the Community Development Department shall issue a permit to
perform within 30 days of the date of issuance any of the acts specified in
division (A) of this section, if:



      (1)   Such acts would result in the abatement of a public
nuisance; or



      (2)   Such acts comply with the regulations or standards of
this code and the village’s Engineering Design & Inspection Policy Manual,
as amended; and



      (3)   The permit application is complete and contains all
necessary information requested by the village, including, without
limitation, the applicant’s name and signature, a plan detailing the
location, number, size and species of trees or shrubs, that will be affected
by work proposed under the permit, a description of the permit’s purpose
and the methods to be used, and any additional information reasonably
requested by the village; and



      (4)   The applicant certifies that he or she has read and
understands those provisions of this chapter and of the ordinance which are
pertinent to the work for which the permit is sought; and



      (5)   The applicant indemnifies and holds the village harmless
for all damage resulting from the permitted work and complies with the
insurance requirements set forth in § 50.05 of this code.



   (C)   Public utility companies. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to exempt public utility companies or their agents from any of the
requirements of this chapter.

authorized by a plat of subdivision approved by the village;



      (3)   Those acts which the Director determines are immediately
necessary to protect or enhance the public health, safety and welfare; and

§ 50.63  PUBLIC NUISANCE - TRIMMING OR REMOVAL REQUIRED.



   (A)   Definition. The following are hereby declared public nuisances
under this chapter:



      (1)   Any dead or dying tree or shrub, whether located on
village-owned property, including right-of-way, or private property, which
affects or may affect village-owned property;



      (2)   Trees infected with Dutch Elm Disease (Ceratocystis
Ulmi) as determined by appropriate laboratory analysis and evaluation of
other common symptoms;



      (3)   Trees infected with the Emerald Ash Borer
(Agrilusplanipennis Fairmarie) as determined by the existence of basal
sprouting, bark fissures, woodpecker damage (i.e., holes), one-eighth inch
“D” shaped holes, the presence of larvae or the adult Emerald Ash Borer
(Agrilusplanipennis Fairmarie), or bark falling off exposing “S” shaped
galleries;



      (4)   Trees that are dead or substantially dead that, because
of their condition, may serve as a breeding place for the European Elm Bark
Beetle (Scolytus Multistriatus), the Native Elm Bark Beetle (Hylurgopinus
Rufipes), or the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilusplanipennis Fairmarie);



      (5)   Trees infected with Oak Wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum)
as determined by appropriate laboratory analysis and evaluation of other
common symptoms;



      (6)   Any otherwise healthy tree or shrub, whether located on
village-owned property, including right-of-way, or private property, which
harbors insects or diseases which reasonably may be expected to injure or
harm any tree or shrub;



      (7)   Any tree or shrub, or portion thereof, whether located
on village-owned property, including right-of-way, or on private property,
which affects or may affect village-owned property, which, by reason of
location or condition constitutes an imminent danger to the health, safety or
welfare of the general public; and



      (8)   Any tree or shrub or portion thereof whether located on
village-owned property, including right-of-way, or private property which
affects or may affect village-owned property, which obstructs sightlines or
the free passage of pedestrian or vehicular traffic or which obstructs a
traffic control device on village property.



   (B)   Right to inspect. The Director has the authority to enter onto
private property between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. whereon there
is located a tree, shrub, plant or plant part which is reasonably suspected
to be a public nuisance, but only to the extent necessary to confirm whether
a public nuisance exists. The Director may take photographs, video, or remove
specimens from any tree to conduct any analysis, laboratory or otherwise, to
determine if a public nuisance exists. Nothing in this section authorizes the
village to force, break, or remove any lock or door to gain entry to an area
to inspect for a nuisance.



   (C)   Abatement. The following are the prescribed means of abating
public nuisances under this chapter:



      (1)   Any public nuisance under this chapter which is located
on village-owned property, including right-of-way, shall be pruned, removed
or otherwise treated by the Public Works Department in whatever fashion is
required to cause the abatement of the nuisance within a reasonable time
after its discovery.



      (2)   Any public nuisance that is located on privately-owned
property shall be pruned, removed, or otherwise treated by the property owner
or his/her agent in whatever fashion is required to cause the abatement of
the nuisance and under the supervision of the Director. No property owner
will be found to have violated this provision unless and until the following
requirements of notice have been satisfied:



         (a)   The Public Works Department shall cause a written
notice to be personally served or sent by certified mail to the person to
whom the general tax bill was addressed for the preceding year;



         (b)   Such notice shall describe by legal description or
by common description the premises;



         (c)   Such notice shall state the actions that the
property owner or occupant may undertake to abate the nuisance;



         (d)   Such notice shall require the elimination of the
nuisance within 30 days of the date of service of the notice, or such shorter
period of time as is deemed necessary for public safety and welfare by the
Public Works Department.



      (3)   If the village removes from any lot or parcel of land,
pursuant to this section, any tree that is a public nuisance, the assessment
of the cost of the work done by the village against the owner of the lot or
parcel of land involved shall be in addition to the penalties imposed herein
for any violation of noncompliance with any provision of this section.



      (4)   The Public Works Department is empowered to cause the
immediate abatement of any public nuisance provided that the nuisance is
determined by the Public Works Department to be an immediate threat to any
person or property. Nothing in this section shall limit or reduce the
village’s authority, statutory or otherwise, to define, prevent and abate
nuisances.

(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 50.65  WIRES AND POLES.



   It is unlawful to attach any wire or rope to any tree or shrub on any
public street, parkway or other public place without the permission of the
Director. Any person or company which maintains poles and wires in the
streets, alleys or other public places, shall in the absence of provision in
the franchise covering the subject, keep such wires and poles free from and
away from any trees and shrubs in such places as far as practicable, and

pavement” defined as brick pavers or stamped concrete/bituminous asphalt,
without notice to the owner. In this event, neither the village nor its
contractors have any obligation to replace, repair or otherwise reconstruct
the non-standard pavement; the responsibility and the cost thereof shall be
the obligation of the owner. The Director may, however, authorize a partial
cost reimbursement which would reflect the village’s cost to repair only
the disturbed portion of the non-standard pavement. The reimbursement will be
based on the current village secured unit cost for asphalt or concrete based
on existing conditions. The owner understands, acknowledges and accepts any
and all responsibility for repair, restoration and any and all other work
necessary to restore non-standard pavement as a result of village damage
during use or access of public R.O.W. shall be owner’s responsibility. The
village shall have no responsibility under any condition for repair or
restoration of non-standard pavement.

§ 51.21  ENTRANCE OF WATER SERVICE CONNECTIONS; EXTENSIONS INTO BUILDINGS:
NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS.



    All water service connections or extensions shall be laid to the
premises so as to enter the building to be served by the most practicable
direct route from the water main. Only one water service shall be permitted
per lot, with the exception of apartments and commercial buildings. All
duplexes must have two water services.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.22  PROXIMITY OF EXTENSIONS TO SEWERS.



   (A)   Horizontal separation. Wherever possible, a water service
should be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any storm or sanitary
sewer. Should conditions exist to prevent the ten feet separation, the water
service may be laid closer to the storm or sanitary sewer provided that the
water service is at least 18 inches above the crown of the sewer, and is
either in a separate trench or in the same trench on an undisturbed earth
shelf. If it is impossible to obtain the ten feet separation or the 18 inch
vertical separation, the sewer must be constructed of either slip-on or
mechanical joint ductile iron pipe or PVC SDR-26 pipe with pressure joints,
meeting water main standards and tested to assure water tightness before
backfilling.



   (B)   Vertical separation. Whenever a water service must cross storm
or sanitary sewers, the water service shall be laid at such an elevation that
the water service is 18 inches above the crown of the sewer. This vertical
separation must be maintained for that portion of the water service located
within ten feet horizontally of any sewer crossed. This must be measured as
the normal distance from the water service to the sewer. If it is impossible
to obtain the proper vertical separation as described above or if it is
necessary for the water service to pass under a sewer, the sewer must be
constructed of slip-on or mechanical joint ductile iron pipe or PVC SDR-26
pipe with pressure joints, meeting water main standards, and must extend on
each side of the crossing until the normal distance from the water service to
the sewer is at least ten feet. Where the water service must cross under a
sewer, a vertical separation of 18 inches between the invert of the sewer and
the crown of the water service shall be maintained, along with means to
support the sewer to prevent its settling and breaking the water service.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.23  UNDERGROUND WATER SERVICE.

   (A)   Water service shall be a minimum of 66 inches in depth.



   (B)   Water service extensions crossing a driveway or sidewalk shall
be backfilled with compacted stone consistent with the Village of South Elgin
Engineering Design and Inspection Policy Manual.



   (C)   When a water service passes through concrete walls and/or
floors, clearance between the pipe and the wall and/or floor shall be not
less than one-half inch. The space between the wall and/or floor and the pipe
shall be packed or caulked with lead or some waterproof rodent resistant
material.



   (D)   The water service shall not show signs of leakage under full
village water pressure not to be less than 20 P.S.I.

the expense of the owner of the property served.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.26  REPAIR OF LEAKS AND DEFECTS; OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.



   Any leaks or defects in domestic water service shall be repaired within
five working days by the property owner. If the existing water service does
not meet village standards it must be replaced to conform to such
requirements prior to backfilling of the trench. Repairs must be approved and
inspected by a representative of the Village Department of Public Works. If
the water service is not repaired within the required time allowed, the water
supply shall be shut off and not turned on again until proper repairs and
inspections have been made. All necessary incurred costs must also be paid by
the property owner.

   This subchapter shall apply to all water entering the stormwater
drainage system and generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless
explicitly exempted by the authorized enforcement agency.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.69  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.



   The village shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of
this subchapter. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the authorized
enforcement agency may be delegated in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the
employ of the village.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.70  ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.



   The standards set forth in this subchapter and promulgated pursuant to
this subchapter are minimum standards; therefore this subchapter does not
intend, nor imply, that compliance by any person will ensure that there will
be no contamination or pollution of stormwater or unauthorized discharge of
pollutants to the stormwater drainage system or to waters of the United
States.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.71  DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.



   (A)   Prohibition of illegal discharges.



      (1)   No person shall throw, drain, or discharge or cause to
be thrown, drained, or discharged into the stormwater drainage system or
waters of the United States any materials, pollutants, or waters containing
any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water
quality standards.



      (2)   The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal
discharge to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited except as described
as follows:



         (a)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge
prohibitions established by this subchapter: water line flushing, fire
hydrant flushing, discharges from potable water sources, landscape
irrigation, lawn watering, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration,
uncontaminated pumped groundwater, diverted stream flows, natural riparian
habitat and wetland flows, springs, storm sewer cleaning water, street wash
water from streets where spills or leaks of pollutants or toxic or hazardous
materials has not occurred (unless the pollutants or toxic or hazardous
materials have been removed), foundation drains, footing drains, crawl space
pumps, air conditioning condensation, noncommercial vehicle washing, routine
external building washing that does not use detergents, dechlorinated
swimming pool discharges (discharges must contain less than one part per
million chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not
containing pollutants.



         (b)   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized
enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety are
allowed.



         (c)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but
requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to
the time of the test.



         (d)   The prohibition shall not apply to any
non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver,
or order and all other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that
written approval has been granted by the authorized enforcement agency for
any discharge to the stormwater drainage system.



   (B)   Prohibition of illicit connections.



      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance, or continued
existence of illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system is
prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this subchapter if
the person connects a line conveying sewage or any other non-stormwater
discharge to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.



      (2)   Improper connections in violation of this subchapter
must be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved onsite
wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of
the village.



      (3)   Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in
plans, maps or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer
system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon
receipt of written notice of violation from the village requiring that such
locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period
within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined,
that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or
other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm
sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified.
Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the
village.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.72  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.



   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations.
The village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to
the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to the MS4, or to
waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
MS4 or waters of the United States and to minimize danger to persons.



   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.



      (1)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this
subchapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will
notify a violator, in writing, of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a
reconsideration and hearing.



      (2)   A person violates this subchapter if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section,
without the prior written approval of the authorized enforcement agency.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.73  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.



   Any person subject to an NPDES construction site activities permit or
NPDES industrial activities permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. the person shall submit to the village a copy of the notice of intent
(NOI) that was provided to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA). Additional proof of compliance with an NPDES construction site
activities permit or NPDES industrial activities permit may be required, in a
form acceptable to the village, prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.74  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.



   (A)   The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter
and inspect premises subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this subchapter. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency.



   (B)   Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement
agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination, copying of records that must be kept under
the conditions of an NPDES permit, and the performance of any additional
duties as required by state and federal law.



   (C)   The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set
up on any premises such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
premises’ stormwater discharge.



   (D)   The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.



   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the premises to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement
agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.



   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement
agency access to a premises are a violation of this subchapter. A person who
is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial activity commits a violation of this subchapter if
the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this subchapter.



   (G)   If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access
to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and it is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part
of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance
with this subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.

§ 51.75 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.



   The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying
Best Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the
stormwater drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner, or
operator of a commercial or industrial establishment, shall provide, at their
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal stormwater drainage system or
waters of the United States through the use of these structural and
non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at the person’s expense, additional structural and
non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be
part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 51.76  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.



   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow
of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.

responsible for a facility or operation, or any person responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation, has information regarding any
known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in
illegal discharges or in pollutants entering stormwater, the stormwater
drainage system, or waters of the United States, the person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, the person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, the person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in
person, by phone, or by facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the village within three business days of the phone
call or personal notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be
retained for at least three years.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 53.01  PURPOSE; SCOPE.



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to  establish
policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within
the village’s jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent
with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of
the village rights-of-way and the village as a whole.



   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the village intends to
exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in
particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by small wireless
facilities and utility facilities, including, without limitation:



      (1)   Preventing interference with the use of streets,
sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places:



      (2)   Preventing the creation of visual and physical
obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and
pedestrian traffic:   



      (3)   Preventing interference with the facilities and
operations of the village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully
located in rights-of-way or public property;   



      (4)   Protecting against environmental damage, including
damage to trees, from the installation of facilities;   



      (5)   Protecting against increased stormwater run-off due to
structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces;



      (6)   Preserving the character of the neighborhoods in which
facilities are installed;



      (7)   Preserving open space, particularly the tree-lined
parkways that characterize the village’s residential neighborhoods;   



      (8)   Preventing visual blight from the proliferation of
facilities in the rights-of-way; and   



      (9)   Assuring the continued safe use and enjoyment of private
properties adjacent to facilities locations.



   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to
all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the
rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the wireless provider or utility as
presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any
applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.



   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in
its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such
an agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent
with this chapter.



   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.



      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In
the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any
conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and
the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the
village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such
franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the
term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



   (F)   Conflicts with other provisions. This chapter supersedes all
chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith, to the extent of such conflict.



   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that
applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the
requirements of this chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements
of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or
state laws or regulations.



   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound
engineering judgment when administering this chapter and may exercise the
power described in § 53.32 to vary the standards, conditions, and
requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so determines.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the village to
regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety
and welfare.

§ 53.11  ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.




   (A)   Application deadlines for small wireless facilities.





      (1)   Applications are deemed complete if the village does not
notify the applicant otherwise within 30 days of receipt of the application.





      (2)   If the application to collocate a small wireless
facility is to be placed on an existing utility pole, the village will notify
the applicant of its approval or denial within 90 days. If the village fails
to notify the applicant within that timeframe, the application will be deemed
approved. If the application to collocate a small wireless facility requires
the installation of a new utility pole, the village will notify the applicant
of its approval or denial within 120 days. If the village fails to notify the
applicant within that timeframe, the application will be deemed approved.





   (B)   Village review of permit applications.





      (1)   Completed permit applications, containing all required
documentation, shall be examined by the Director of Public Works on a
nondiscriminatory basis. If the application does not conform to the
requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, or regulations
that concern public safety, the Director of Public Works shall notify the
applicant of the basis for a denial, including specific code provisions upon
which the denial was based. The applicant may cure the deficiencies and
resubmit a revised application without paying additional application fees.





      (2)   When reviewing applications for small wireless
facilities, the village will approve or deny the revised application within
30 days after the applicant resubmits the application or it will be deemed
approved. If the Director of Public Works is satisfied that the proposed work
conforms to the requirements of this chapter and applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of Public Works shall issue
a permit. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the
construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with
the requirements of this chapter.





   (C)   Additional village review of applications of
telecommunications retailers.





      (1)   Pursuant to section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS
Ch. 220, Act 65, § 4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village
that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. This notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the village not less than ten days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days
prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Director of
Public Works shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the
facility may be placed, used and constructed.   





      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either (i) ten days after service of notice to the village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction or (ii) 25 days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.





      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village,
where a permit is required for work pursuant to § 53.10, the
telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an application for a
permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject
to the requirements of division (A) of this section.





   (D)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 (ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5, § 21-401) shall be
deemed granted 45 days after submission to the village, unless otherwise
acted upon by the village, provided the holder has complied with applicable
village codes, ordinances, rules and regulations.




(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14; Am. Ord. 2018-46, passed 9-17-18)



§ 53.12  EFFECT OF PERMIT.




   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest
created. A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only
certain activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the
rights-of-way.





   (B)   Duration. No permit issued to a utility shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. Collocation
of small wireless facilities must be completed within 180 days after the
issuance of the permit. If collocation is not complete, the permit will be
void. Permits for small wireless facilities are valid for five years from the
time of issuance.





   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village
with such village representatives in attendance as the village deems
necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under
the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where
work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of
other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and
access and egress by adjacent property owners.





   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by
the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the village and applicable local, state and federal statutes,
laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.




(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14; Am. Ord. 2018-46, passed 9-17-18)



§ 53.13  REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.



   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate
from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit
also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with § 53.38. If the village denies the
request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility
from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the
permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 53.14  INSURANCE.




   (A)   Required coverages and limits.





      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or
similar agreement, each wireless provider or utility occupying right-of-way
or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintainthe
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
divisions (A)(1)(a) and (b) below:





         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including
premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly
referred to as “X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and
products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than:





            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or
death to each person;





            2.   Five million dollars for property damage
resulting from any one accident;





            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of
liability; and





            4.   Wireless providers must include the village
as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy.





         (b)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits;





         (c)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of

         (d)   Property insurance for replacement costs against
all risks.





      (2)   If the wireless provider or utility is not providing
such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the
work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this
division (A).





   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this
division (B) may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella
policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over
underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss
covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy,
the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.





   (C)   Copies required. The wireless provider or utility shall
provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to the village
within ten days following receipt of a written request therefor from the
village.





   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.





      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall
contain the following endorsement:





      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt
by the village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village President of such
intent to cancel or not to renew.”





      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of this
notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to the cancellation, the
utility shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.





   (E)   Self-insurance. A wireless provider or utility may self-insure
all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by
division (A) of this section. A wireless provider or utility that
self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply
with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under division (A)
of this section, or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D) of this
section. A wireless provider or utility that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required
under division (A) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a
“private self insurer” under the Worker’s Compensation Act.





   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s
liability. The legal liability of the wireless provider or utility to the
village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of
any amounts thereunder.





   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this
section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by
insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of
Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated
“A-“ or better and of a class size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.

§ 53.15  INDEMNIFICATION.




   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a wireless
provider or utility shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold
the village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees,
agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of,
resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent,
careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the
utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the
rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this
chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however,
that the wireless provider or utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder
shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses
or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or
breach of this article by the village, its officials, officers, employees,
agents or representatives.




(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14; Am. Ord. 2018-46, passed 9-17-18)



§ 53.16  SECURITY.



   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a
form and in the amount set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s
sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:



      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the
requirements of this chapter;



      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village
occasioned by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant to this chapter; and   



      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration
work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village
must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the
permittee’s failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the
village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable
law.



   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the
village in the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in
a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:



      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior
notice to the village and the permittee;



      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the
collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and



      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and
within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.



   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works,
and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village
estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such
restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit
will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each
phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related
group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous
phase or phases, the Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which
shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The
amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this
division (C) for any single phase.



   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days’ advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the
security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for
such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:



      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the
permittee hereunder;



      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that
are due and unpaid;



      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by
reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or



      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that
the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
security fund.



   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice
from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
division (C) of this section.



   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by
the village, upon written request for the withdrawal to the village, provided
that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum
balance required in division (C) of this section.



   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a
result of the revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of the costs,
loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.



   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with
respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the
village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to the security fund
shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery
with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise
violated.

(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 53.31  PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONTROL.




   (A)   Public safety.





      (1)   The placement of any antenna, wireless facility or small
wireless facilities located in the village right-of-way may not interfere
with the frequencies used by public safety agencies for public safety
communications. Unacceptable interference will be determined in accordance
with industry standards and the Federal Communications Commission’s
regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum.
If an antenna, wireless facility or small wireless facility causes such
interference, the owner must take all steps necessary to correct and
eliminate the interference at its own costs. The village may terminate a
permit for any antenna, wireless facility or small wireless facility based on
such interference if the interference is not corrected.





      (2)   The village may reserve space on its utility pole for
future public safety uses [or for the village’s electric utility uses].
This reservation of space may preclude the collocation of a small wireless
facility where the village determines that the utility pole cannot
accommodate both uses.





   (B)   Minimum requirements. The village’s minimum requirements for
traffic protection are contained in IDOT’s Illinois Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices and this code.





   (C)   Warning signs, protective devices, and flaggers. The wireless
provider or utility is responsible for providing and installing warning
signs, protective devices and flaggers, when necessary, meeting applicable
federal, state, and local requirements for protection of the public and the
utility’s workers when performing any work on the rights-of-way.   





   (D)   Interference with traffic. All work shall be phased so that
there is minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.





   (E)   Notice when access is blocked. At least 48 hours prior to
beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any
residence, business or institution, the wireless provider or utility shall
notify the resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning
time and duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving
emergency repairs pursuant to § 53.37, the wireless provider or utility
shall provide such notice as is practicable under the circumstances.





   (F)   Compliance. The wireless provider or utility shall take
immediate action to correct any deficiencies in traffic protection
requirements that are brought to its attention by the village.




(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14; Am. Ord. 2018-46, passed 9-17-18)



§ 53.32  LOCATION OF FACILITIES.



   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements
applicable to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities,
regardless of type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of
this division (A).



      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility
facilities shall be placed in any location if the Director of Public Works
determines that the proposed location will require the relocation or
displacement of any of the village’s utility facilities or will otherwise
interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the village’s utility
facilities.



      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location
shall cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of the
right-of-way and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and
interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners
who adjoin the right-of-way.



      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall
be placed in any location that interferes with the usual travel on such
right-of-way.



      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall
be placed in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the
right-of-way.



      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation
shall use the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power
pedestals, and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of
location, for the particular application.




      (6)   Aesthetic approval. Those facilities located above
ground shall be submitted for aesthetic approval to the Community Development
Department and the Parks and Recreation Department and that approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned by the village; however, the
facility shall be modified as requested to the greatest extent practicable.




      (7)   The village is not required to install or maintain any
specific utility pole or to continue to install or maintain utility poles in
any location if it makes a non-discriminatory decision to eliminate
above-ground utility poles of a particular type. For village utility poles
with collocated small wireless facilities in place when the village makes a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles, the village will, at its
discretion, either maintain the utility pole or install and maintain an
alternative utility pole for the collocation of the small wireless facility,
or offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider.



   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.



      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel
facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:



         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the
right-of-way line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as
reasonable pole alignment will permit;



         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as
practicable from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind
the face of the curb, where available;



         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote
from pavement edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m)
outside the outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear
zone;   



         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway;
and



         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within
one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the
right-of-way line.



      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel
facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:



         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way
line as practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to
the right-of-way line;



         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved
portion of a highway only if other locations are impracticable or
inconsistent with sound engineering judgment (e.g.. a new cable may be
installed in existing conduit without disrupting the pavement); and



         (c)   In the case of an underground power or
communications line, the facility shall be located as near the right-of-way
line as practicable and not more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way
line and any above-grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot
(0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as practicable.



   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.



      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of
crossing facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of
village highways may require the incorporation of materials and protections
(such as encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future
repairs to the roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing
facilities.



      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
Crossing facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or
drainage facilities.



      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities
shall cross at or as near to a 90-degree angle to the centerline as
practicable.



      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead
power or communication facility may cross a highway only if:



         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as
required by ICCs rules entitled, “Construction of Electric Power and
Communication Lines” (83 III. Adm. Code 305);



         (b)   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the
right-of-way line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and



         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are
avoided.



      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An
underground power or communication facility may cross a highway only if:



         (a)   The design materials and construction methods will
provide maximum maintenance-free service life; and



         (b)   Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future
expansion needs is provided in the initial installation.



      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide
a marker at each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a
power or communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify
the type of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may
also be eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R.§
192.707 (1989)).



   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The
village may require that facilities be located within particular
rights-of-way that are not highways, rather than within particular highways.



   (E)   Freestanding facilities.




      (1)   Small wireless facilities.





         (a)   The village may not require the placement of a
small wireless facility on a specific utility pole or category of poles.
However, should the application necessitate the installation of a new utility
pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated
on an existing utility pole or existing support structure within 100 feet of
the proposed collocation. Should the applicant reject the proposed relocated
collocation, it must provide a written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternative location
will not satisfy the wireless provider’s needs. The village may require any
monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view in compliance with the appearance
standards described below.





         (b)   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other
aboveground facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new
monopoles, utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located
on the same side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities.
If there exist above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding
facilities shall be located on the side where the above ground facilities
most closely match the scale of the new freestanding facility.





      (2)   Other facilities.





         (a)   The village may restrict the location and size of
any monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way. No freestanding facility located within a right-of-way may be
constructed or modified so that the height of the free standing facility is
higher by more than ten feet or more than 10%, whichever is greater, than any
other existing, freestanding facility located within the right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed facility, measured along the center line of the
respective right-of-way. Where there are no other freestanding facilities
located within 300 feet of the proposed facility, the maximum height of the
freestanding facility shall be 45 feet.





         (b)   The village may require any monopole, utility pole
or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened
from view.





         (c)   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other
aboveground facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new
monopoles, utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located
on the same side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities.
If there exist above ground facilities on both sides, new
freestandingfacilities shall be located on the side where the above ground
facilities most closely match the scale of the new freestanding facility.





   (F)   Height restrictions for small wireless facilities. Small
wireless facilities are limited to a maximum height of ten feet above the
utility pole or wireless structure on which it is collocated. The height
limit of a new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure on
which small wireless facilities are collocated is limited to the higher of:
(i) ten feet higher than the tallest existing utility pole within 300 feet of
the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure that is in
the same right-of-way; or (ii) 45 feet above ground level. The village shall
designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structure shall control the height
limitation.





   (G)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may
be installed only if:





      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located
underground;





      (2)   New underground installation is not technically
feasible; and





      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location,
and will employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest
protection of aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without
adversely affecting safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to,
self-supporting armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration
of conductors and cable. Existing utility poles and municipally- owned
infrastructure shall be used wherever practicable; the installation of
additional utility poles or monopoles is strongly discouraged.





   (H)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.





      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or
roadway structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other
means of accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall
include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles,
cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from
the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are
volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under
significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk and such
installations are not permitted.





      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a
facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data
demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or
disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:





         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the
commodity to be transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to
persons and property in the event of damage to or failure of the facility;





         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance
of the highway structure in the transportation system;   





         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility
and their comparative practicability;   





         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;





         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased
load of the proposed facility;





         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance
and painting;





         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure;
and





         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility
service as compared to the risk involved.





   (I)   Design and appearance standards.





      (1)   Residential design standards.





         (a)   Purpose. Ensure visually acceptable facility
design and to provide discretion on required and preferred design of small
wireless facilities.





         (b)   Applicability. These design standards shall apply
to each facility located in a district zoned for residential uses:





            1.   Applicants must use architectural treatments
and stealth techniques to reduce potential visual impacts from all small
wireless facilities.





            2.   All new utility poles installed for the
purpose of mounting a facility must be stealth or camouflaged to blend into
the surrounding environment. Examples of stealth of camouflage designs are
presented in Figure 1.





FIGURE 1:  SAMPLE STEALTH DESIGNS FOR SMALL CELL UTILITY POLES



























            3.   Small wireless facilities and all ancillary
equipment associated with the facility must not emit sound.





            4.   Cables must be routed directly from the
ground through the pole and equipment enclosures must completely enclose or
hide cabling. No exposed cable is allowed.





            5.   No flashing lights or unnecessary,
non-essential stickers are allowed to be placed on any facility. Stickers
must be designed in the same color as the pole to which they are attached.





            6.   In no case shall equipment block the sidewalk
or pedestrian pathway. All installations must maintain accessibility
requirements and standards.





            7.   All newly installed equipment must be painted
with graffiti-resistant pain to match pole color and surroundings.





            8.   Colors and materials for small wireless
facilities shall be chosen to minimize the visibility of the facility.





            9.   Antennas attached to existing poles or
municipally-owned infrastructure shall be painted and textured to match the
existing structure.





            10.   Any around-mounted facility shall be painted
with non-reflective matte finish paint using color shades that are comparable
or blend with surrounding natural elements such as soil, trees, or
grasslands. Any ground-mounted facility shall be screened from the yard of
the property in front of which it is located using year-round landscaping
materials. The owner of the ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the
landscaping materials for a period of one-year from planting.





            11.   All disturbed pavement and landscaping shall
be replaced and areas of bare or disturbed soils must be re-vegetated. If
replacement landscape is determined to be infeasible the village may accept
mitigation funds to use elsewhere. The owner of the ground-mounted facility

regulations.





         (b)   Applicability. These design standards shall apply
to:





            1.   Each area, district, neighborhood or zone
expressly designated in the village’s Comprehensive Plan as having special
aesthetic or economic impacts on the welfare of the community; and





            2.   Each redevelopment area designed under the
Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act or the Business District
Development and Redevelopment Act:





               A.    Siting of small wireless facilities in
special aesthetic/economic purpose zones must respect the existing character
or design ordinance of established zone.





               B.    Applicants must include proposed
stealth and concealment measures in their applications.





               C.    Effective camouflage so as to disguise
the facility so that it appears to be something other than a facility and is
at the same time compatible with its surroundings (for example, designed to
look like a tree).





               D.    Small wireless facilities must be
designed so that the facilities silhouette, mass and color are masked in such
a way as to be virtually indistinguishable from their background.





               E.    Examples of stealth of camouflage
designs are presented in Figure 1 above.





      (3)   Design standards in historic districts.

structures or objects, significant in American history, architecture,
archeology, engineering or culture, that are listed, or are eligible for
listing, in the National Register of Historic Places are to be avoided, to
the greatest extent possible. Local landmarked buildings, properties, sites,
or historic districts that are so recognized bv an ordinance that meets the
requirements of the certified Local Government Program of the Illinois State
Historic Preservation Office are also to be avoided, to the greatest extent
possible.





               B.    Applicants must include proposed
stealth and concealment measures in their applications.





               C.    Applicant must implement said
village-approved design concepts, and the use of camouflage or stealth
materials as necessary in order to achieve compliance with historic
preservation review.





               D.    Prior to submitting an application,
where the applicant submits an application to site facilities in a historic
district, the applicant must meet with the village to discuss any potential
design modifications appropriate for the installation.





               E.   When siting a facility in a historic
district, wireless provider must avoid removing, obscuring or altering any
historic material or significant architectural features. Rehabilitation and
make-ready work must not destroy the distinguishing character of the property
or its environment.





               F.    Deteriorated architectural features
should be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible by means such as

appurtenances, must be a color that blends with the surroundings of the
utility pole or municipally-owned infrastructure on which it is mounted and
use non-reflective materials which blend with the materials and colors of the
surrounding area and structures. Any wiring must be concealed within the
freestanding facility or covered with an appropriate cover.





            2.   The village may discourage the installation
of facilities in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.





            3.   A facility may be constructed only if its
construction does not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or
terrain features visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents
and property owners.





            4.   A facility may not be installed in a manner
which defeats any existing concealment elements of the utility pole or
municipally-owned infrastructure to which it is attached.





            5.    Facilities under common ownership or
operated on the same radio frequency shall be separated as far as practicable.

a manner satisfactory to the village and at the utility’s expense.



   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:



      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion
of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all
necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the
right-of-way including the use of signs, tights, barricades or flaggers. If a
hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in
repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on
the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means
of access to the facility is available.



      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible,
notify the Village Engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for
protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere
with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified
immediately.



      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand
to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.



   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the
village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48
hours after an emergency repair.

§ 53.38  VARIANCES.



   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one
or more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the
Director of Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request
shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.



   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Director of Public Works
shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this
chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.



   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Director of Public
Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance
has demonstrated that:



      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the
utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and



      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or
facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is
requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.



   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a
condition for authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may
require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and
conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but
which carry out the purposes of this chapter.



   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order,
requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made
by the Director of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter shall
have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or
commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted
in writing to the Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village
Board shall timely decide the appeal.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 53.98  ENFORCEMENT.



   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional
or further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter.



(Ord. 2014-23, passed 6-16-14)



§ 53.99  PENALTY.



   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when
the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit
and this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the
cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall
bear the village’s costs of damages and its costs of installing,
maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may
review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village.
Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs
apportioned to it.

   (C)   For purposes of this section, the following general provisions
and definitions shall apply.



      AGREEMENT.  The acceptance of the license by the licensee
constitutes an agreement that the movement will be made strictly in
compliance with the terms set forth in the license.



      AUTHORIZED TIMES OF MOVEMENT.  The village may authorize
movements between sunrise and sunset on business days; and between sunrise
and noon on Saturdays. Movements are further restricted on specific holidays,
beginning at noon the day preceding the holiday or holiday weekend. The
specified holidays are: New Years Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.



      ESCORT VEHICLES.  One escort vehicle will be required on all
loads more than 12 feet wide. Escort vehicles shall display red flags at the
extremities, display “OVERSIZE LOAD” signs, be equipped with an operating
rotating or flashing amber light mounted on top, and be operated by properly
licensed operators at least 18 years of age. A pole for measuring vertical
clearances shall be mounted on the lead escort vehicle for moves in excess of
14 feet, 6 inches in height. The driver of the escort vehicle must be in
radio contact with the driver of the license vehicle.



      HIGHWAY CONDITIONS.  Movements shall not be made when the
highway or roadways are covered with snow or ice.



      INCLEMENT WEATHER.  When visibility is unduly impaired by rain,
snow, fog, smog, or at any time travel conditions are considered to be unsafe
by the South Elgin Police Department.



      JURISDICTION.  The license is effective only insofar as the
village has jurisdiction and does not release the licensee from complying
with other existing laws that may apply to the movement.



      LEGAL HEIGHT MOVEMENTS.  License authority is not required for
the movement of vehicle(s), inclusive of load, not exceeding the legal height
limit of 13 feet 6 inches, as established in Chapter 15 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 15).  Therefore, no action is taken by
the village, either separately or in conjunction with the authorizing as
otherwise oversized or overweight movements, to ensure adequate clearance of
structures for a vehicle(s) inclusive load, not exceeding 14 feet, 6 inches
overall height.



      LIABILITY INSURANCE. Owner and/or operators of escort vehicles
with oversized loads, exceeding ten feet in width, 13 feet 6 inches in
height, 110 feet in length, or overweight must have in effect or be
self-insured in the minimum amount of $500,000 per occurrence combined bodily
injury and property damage.



      LOCATIONS WHERE LICENSE IS NOT VALID.  The license is not valid
on any highway or bridge posted for a load limit less than the gross weight
of the move, on any highway closed to traffic, or on any highway not
maintained by the Village of South Elgin.



      PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIABILITY.  The licensee assumes all
responsibility for injury to persons or damage to public or private property,
including his or her own, caused directly or indirectly by the transportation
of vehicles or vehicles and objects authorized under this license. The
licensee agrees to hold the Village of South Elgin harmless for all suits,
claims, damages, or proceedings of any kind and to indemnify the Village of
South Elgin for any claim it may be required to pay arising from the movement.



      RED FLAGS.  The extremities of all oversized vehicles, vehicle
combinations or loads, and all protruding objects shall be marked with clean
red flags not less than 18 inches square.



      RIGHT-OF-WAY DURING MOVEMENT.  Insofar as practicable, movements
shall be confined to a single traffic lane and shall be made in such a manner
that the rest of the roadway will be open at all times so the flow or other
traffic will not unnecessarily be obstructed. Also, insofar as practicable,
other traffic will be given the right-of-way over this movement. The driver
shall remove the vehicle from the roadway when necessary to allow an
accumulation of traffic to pass, or when so directed by a police officer.



      SPEED.  Maximum speed shall be 45 m.p.h. for all license
movements, or 5 m.p.h. above the minimum posted speed limit, EXCEPT when
otherwise specified on the license. Legal weight, legal height movements up
to and including ten feet wide are allowed to travel at the legal maximum
speed limit.



      OVERWEIGHT MOVEMENTS.  An overweight license authorizes the
movement of a vehicle, or a reasonably disassembled single object loaded on a
vehicle combination. If stated in the license, the object may include an
attachment; however, if must be securely mounted on the object being towed.
The attachment may not be hauled as a separate object on the vehicle
combination.

§ 71.36  SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.



   (A)   Any person who drives or is in actual physical control of a
motor vehicle upon the public highways of the city shall be deemed to have
given consent, subject to the provisions of § 71.37, to a chemical test or
tests of blood, breath, other bodily substance or urine for the purpose of
determining the content of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating
compound or compounds or any combination thereof in the person’s blood if
arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket, for an
offense as defined in § 71.35. If a law enforcement officer has probable
cause to believe the person was under the influence of alcohol, other drug or
drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof, the
law enforcement officer shall request a chemical test or tests which shall be
administered at the direction of the arresting officer.  The law enforcement
agency employing the officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests
shall be administered.  Up to two additional tests of urine or other bodily
substance may be administered even after a blood or breath test or both has
been administered.  For purposes of this section, an Illinois law
enforcement officer who is investigating the person for any offense defined
in § 71.35 may travel into an adjoining state, where the person has been
transported for medical care, to complete an investigation and to request
that the person submit to the test or tests set forth in this section.  The
requirements of this section that the person be arrested are inapplicable,
but the officer shall issue the person a Uniform Traffic Ticket for an
offense as defined in § 71.35 prior to requesting that the person submit to
the test or tests.  The issuance of the Uniform Traffic Ticket shall not
constitute an arrest, but shall be for the purpose of notifying the person
that he or she is subject to the provisions of this section and of the
officer’s belief of the existence of probable cause to arrest.  Upon
returning to this state, the officer shall file the Uniform Traffic Ticket
with the Circuit Clerk of the county where the offense was committed, and
shall seek the issuance of an arrest warrant or a summons for the person.



   (B)   Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to
have withdrawn the consent provided by division (A) of this section and the
test or tests may be administered, subject to the provisions of § 71.37.



   (C)   (1)   A person requested to submit to a test as provided
above shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that
a refusal to submit to the test will result in the statutory summary
suspension of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle as provided
in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-208.1, and will also result in the
disqualification of the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor
vehicle, as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-514, if the person is a CDL
holder. The person shall also be warned that a refusal to submit to the test,
when the person was involved in a motor vehicle accident that caused personal
injury or death to another, will result in the statutory summary revocation
of the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle as provided in ILCS
Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-208.1, and will also result in the disqualification of
the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided
in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-514, if the person is a CDL holder. The person
shall also be warned by the law enforcement officer that if the person
submits to the test or tests provided in division (A) of this section and the
alcohol concentration in the person’s blood or breath is 0.08 or greater,
or testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis
Control Act (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 550, §§ 1 et seq.) with a
tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-501.2(a)(6), or any amount of a drug, substance or compound resulting from
the unlawful use or consumption of or a controlled substance listed in the
Illinois Controlled Substances Act (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 570, §§ 100 et seq.),
an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 690, §§ 1 et seq.), or methamphetamine as listed in the
Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 646,
§§ 1 et seq.) is detected in the person’s blood, other bodily substance
or urine, a statutory summary suspension of the person’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-208.1 and
this section will be imposed. If the person is also a CDL holder, he or she
shall be warned by the law enforcement officer that if the person submits to
the test or tests provided in division (A) above and the alcohol
concentration in the person's blood, other bodily substance, or breath is
0.08 or greater, or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound resulting
from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as covered by the Cannabis
Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled
Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control
and Community Protection Act is detected in the person's blood, other bodily
substance or urine, a disqualification of the person’s privilege to operate
a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-514,

person is requested to submit to a test as provided above shall, in addition
to the warnings provided for in this section, be further warned by the law
enforcement officer requesting the test that if the person submits to the
test or tests provided in division (A) of this section and the alcohol
concentration in the person’s blood, other bodily substance or breath is
greater than 0.00 and less than 0.08, a suspension of the person’s
privilege to operate a motor vehicle, as provided under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5,
§ 6-208.2 and § 71.42 will be imposed.  The results of this test shall be
admissible in a civil or criminal action or proceeding arising from an arrest
for an offense as defined in § 71.35 or pursuant to § 71.38 in prosecutions
for reckless homicide brought under ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, §§ 1-1 et seq.,
the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.  These test results,
however, shall be admissible only in actions or proceedings directly related
to the incident upon which the test request was made.



      (3)   A person requested to submit to a test shall also
acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section.
If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law
enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the
person refused to sign the warning. A person’s refusal to sign the warning
shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.



   (D)   If the person refuses testing or submits to a test that
discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or testing discloses the
presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a
tetrahydrocannabinal concentration as defined in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-501.2(a)(6) or any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating compound in
the person’s breath, bloody, other bodily substance or urine resulting from
the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the
Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or an intoxicating compound listed in the
Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the
Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law enforcement
officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the circuit court of venue
and the Secretary of State, certifying that the test or tests was or were
requested under division (A) and the person refused to submit to a test, or
tests, or submitted to testing that disclosed an alcohol concentration of
0.08 or more, testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the
Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501.2(a)(6), or any amount of a drug, substance,
or intoxicating compound in the person's breath, blood, other bodily
substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a
controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or
methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community
Protection Act. If the person is also a CDL holder and refuses testing or
submits to a test that discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or
any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in the person's
breath, blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful
use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a
controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an
intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or

consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled
substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating
compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act.



   (E)   (1)   Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement
officer submitted under division (D), the Secretary of State shall enter the
statutory summary suspension or revocation and disqualification for the
periods specified in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-208.1 and ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5,
§ 6-514, respectively, and effective as provided in division (G).



      (2)   If the person is a first offender as defined in ILCS Ch.
625, Act 5, § 11-500, and is not convicted of a violation of § 71.35, then
reports received by the Secretary of State under this section shall, except
during the actual time the statutory summary suspension is in effect, be
privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers,
prosecuting authorities or the Secretary of State, unless the person is a CDL
holder, is operating a commercial motor vehicle or vehicle required to be
placarded for hazardous materials, in which case the suspension shall not be

shall also be made available to the parent or guardian of a person under the
age of 18 years that holds an instruction permit or a graduated driver’s
license, regardless of whether the statutory summary suspension is in effect.
A statutory summary revocation shall not be privileged information.



   (F)   The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under
division (D) shall serve immediate notice of the statutory summary suspension
or revocation on the person and the suspension or revocation and
disqualification shall be effective as provided in division (G). In cases
involving a person who is not a CDL holder where the blood alcohol
concentration of 0.08 or greater or any amount of a drug, substance or
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled
substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating
compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control andCommunity Protection Act is
established by a subsequent analysis of blood. other bodily substance or
urine or analysis of whole blood or other bodily substance establishes a
tetrahydrocannabinal concentration as defined in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-501.2(a)(b), collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer or
arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this section or by deposit
in the United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid
and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown of the Uniform
Traffic Ticket and the statutory summary suspension shall begin as provided
in division (G). In cases involving a person who is a CDL holder where the
blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater or any amount of a drug,
substance, or compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of
cannabis as covered by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance
listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound
listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act,  or methamphetamine as
listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act is
established by a  subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or
urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting  officer or arresting
agency shall give notice as provided in this section or by deposit in the
United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and
addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic
Ticket and the statutory summary suspension and disqualification shall begin

person a receipt, in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, that will
allow that person to drive during the periods provided for in division (G).
The officer shall immediately forward the driver’s license or permit to the
circuit court of venue along with the sworn report provided in division (D).



   (G)   The statutory summary suspension or revocation and
disqualification referred to in this section shall take effect on the 46th
day following the date the notice of the statutory summary suspension or
revocation was given to the person.



   (H)   The following procedure shall apply whenever a person is
arrested for any offense as defined in § 71.35:  Upon receipt of the sworn
report from the law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall confirm
the statutory summary suspension or revocation by mailing a notice of the
effective date of the suspension or revocation to the person and the court of
venue. The Secretary of State shall also mail notice of the effective date of
the disqualification to the person. However, should the sworn report be
defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error,
the confirmation of the statutory summary suspension or revocation shall not
be mailed to the person or entered to the record, instead the sworn report
shall be forwarded to the court of venue with a copy returned to the issuing
agency identifying any defect.



   (I)   As used in this section PERSONAL INJURY includes any Type A
injury as indicated on the traffic accident report completed by a law
enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either
a doctor's office or a medical facility.  A Type A injury includes severely
bleeding wounds, distorted extremities, and injuries that require the injured
party to be carried from the scene.



(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501.1)



§ 71.37  CHEMICAL AND OTHER TESTS.



   (A)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding
arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in § 71.35 or proceedings
pursuant to ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 2-118.1, evidence of the concentration of
alcohol, other drug or combination thereof in a person's blood or breath at
the time alleged, as determined by analysis of the person's blood, urine,
breath or other bodily substance, shall be admissible.  Where such test is
made the following provisions shall apply:



      (1)   Chemical analyses of the person’s blood, urine, breath
or other bodily substance to be considered valid under the provisions of this
section shall have  been performed  according to  standards promulgated 
by the  Department of  State  Police by a licensed  physician, registered
nurse, trained phlebotomist, licensed paramedic or other individual
possessing a valid permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The
Director of State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or
methods, to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to
conduct such analyses, to issue permits which shall be subject to termination
or revocation at the discretion of that Department and to certify the
accuracy of breath testing equipment. The Department of State Police shall
prescribe regulations as necessary to implement this section.



      (2)   (a)   When a person in this city shall submit to a
blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions
of § 71.36, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed
physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice nurse, a registered nurse,
trained phlebotomist, licensed paramedic or other qualified person approved
by the Department of State Police may withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug or alcohol and drug content therein.  This
limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.



         (b)   When a blood test of a person who has been taken
to an adjoining state for medical treatment is requested by an Illinois law
enforcement officer, the blood may be withdrawn only by a physician
authorized to practice medicine in the adjoining state, a licensed physician
assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse,
a trained phlebotomist acting under the direction of the physician or
licensed paramedic. The law enforcement officer requesting the test shall
take custody of the blood sample, and the blood sample shall be analyzed by a
laboratory certified by the Department of State Police for that purpose.



      (3)   The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified
technician, chemist, registered nurse or other qualified person of his or her
own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any
administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer.  The failure or
inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of
a law enforcement officer.



      (4)   Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a
chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full
information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the
person or such person's attorney.



      (5)   Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol
per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.



      (6)   Tetrahydrocannabinol concentration means either 5
nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of whole
blood or 10 nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter
of other  bodily substance.



      (7)   Law enforcement officials may use standardized field
sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
when conducting investigations of a violation of § 71.35 or similar local
ordinance by drivers suspected of driving under the influence of cannabis.
The General Assembly finds that standardized field sobriety tests approved by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are divided attention
tasks that are intended to determine if a person is under the influence of
cannabis. The purpose of these tests is to determine the effect of the use of
cannabis on a person's capacity to think and act with ordinary care and
therefore operate a motor vehicle safely. Therefore, the results of these
standardized field sobriety tests, appropriately administered, shall be
admissible in the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising
out of an arrest for a cannabis-related offense as defined in § 71.35 or a
similar local ordinance or proceedings under Section ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
2-118.1. Where a test is made the following provisions shall apply:



         (a)   The person tested may have a physician, or a
qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of
their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to the
standardized field sobriety test or tests administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional
test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer. 



         (b)   Upon the request of the person who shall submit to
a standardized field sobriety test or tests at the request of a law
enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be
made available to the person or the person's attorney. 



         (c)   At the trial of any civil or criminal action or
proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in § 71.35 or
a similar local ordinance or proceedings under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
2-118.1 or 2-118.2 in which the results of these standardized field sobriety
tests are admitted, the cardholder may present and the trier of fact may
consider evidence that the card holder lacked the physical capacity to
perform the standardized field sobriety tests. 



   (B)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding
arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while
driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at
the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath,
or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:



      (1)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of
0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the
influence of alcohol.



      (2)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in
excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, such facts shall not give rise to any
presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol,
but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining
whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.



      (3)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of
0.08 or more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of
alcohol.



      (4)   The foregoing provisions of this section shall not be
construed as limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing
upon the question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.



      (5)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or
proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person
while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds
or any combination thereof, the concentration of cannabis in the person's
whole blood or other bodily substance at the time alleged as shown by
analysis of the person's blood or other bodily substance shall give rise to
the following presumptions:



         (a)   If there was a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration
of 5 nanograms or more in whole blood or 10 nanograms or more in an other
bodily substance as defined in this section, it shall be presumed that the
person was under the influence of cannabis.



         (b)   If there was at that time a tetrahydrocannabinol
concentration of less than 5 nanograms in whole blood or less than 10
nanograms in an other bodily substance, such  facts shall not give rise to
any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of
cannabis, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining whether the person was under the influence of cannabis.



   (C)   (1)   If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a
chemical test under the provisions of § 71.36, evidence of refusal shall be
admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts
alleged to have been committed while the person under the influence of
alcohol, or other drugs, or combination of both was driving or in actual
physical control of a motor vehicle.



      (2)   Notwithstanding any ability to refuse under this code to
submit to these tests or any ability to revoke the implied consent to these
tests, if a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a
motor vehicle driven by or in actual physical control of a person under the
influence of alcohol, any other drug,  or combination of both has caused the
death or personal injury to another, the law enforcement officer shall
request, and that person shall submit, upon the request of a law enforcement
officer, to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, other
bodily substance or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content
thereof or the presence of any other drug or combination of both.  This
provision does not affect the applicability of or imposition of driver’s
license sanctions under § 71.36.



      (3)   For purposes of this section, a personal injury includes
any “Type A” injury as indicated on the traffic accident report completed
by a law enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention
in either a doctor's office or a medical facility.  A “Type A” injury
includes severe bleeding wounds, distorted extremities, and injuries that
require the injured party to be carried from the scene.



   (D)   If a person refuses standardized field sobriety tests under
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501.9,  evidence of refusal shall be admissible
in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts committed
while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle and
alleged to have been impaired by the use of cannabis.



(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §11-501.2)



§ 71.38  ADMISSIBILITY OF CHEMICAL TESTS OF BLOOD OR URINE CONDUCTED IN THE
REGULAR COURSE OF PROVIDING EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT.



   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the results of
blood or urine tests performed for the purpose of determining the content of
alcohol, other drug, or both, of an individual’s blood, other bodily
substance or urine conducted upon persons receiving medical treatment in a
hospital emergency room are admissible in evidence as a business record
exception to the hearsay rule only in prosecutions for any violation of §
71.35 or in prosecutions for reckless homicide brought under Criminal Code of
1961 (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, §§ 1-1 et seq.) or the Criminal Code of 2012,
when each of the following criteria are met:



      (1)   The chemical tests performed upon an individual’s
blood, other bodily substance or urine were ordered in the regular course of
providing emergency medical treatment and not at the request of law
enforcement authorities;



      (2)   The chemical tests performed upon an individual’s
blood, other bodily substance or urine were performed by the laboratory
routinely used by the hospital; and



      (3)   Results of chemical tests performed upon an
individual’s blood, other bodily substance or urine are admissible into
evidence regardless of the time that the records were prepared.



   (B)   The confidentiality provisions of law pertaining to medical
records and medical treatment shall not be applicable with regard to chemical
tests performed upon an individual’s blood, other bodily substance or urine
under the provisions of this section in prosecutions as specified in division
(A) of this section.  No person shall be liable for civil damages as a
result of the evidentiary use of chemical testing of an individual’s blood,
other bodily substance or urine test results under this section, or as a
result of that person’s testimony made available under this section.



(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501.4)



§ 71.39  PRELIMINARY BREATH SCREENING TEST.



   If a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a
person is violating or has violated § 71.35, the officer, prior to an
arrest, may request the person to provide a sample of his or her breath for a
preliminary breath screening test using a portable device approved by the
Department of Public Health. The person may refuse the test.  The results of
this preliminary breath screening test may be used by the law enforcement
officer for the purpose of assisting with the determination of whether to
require a chemical test as authorized under §§ 71.36 and 71.37, and the
appropriate type of test to request.  Any chemical test authorized under
§§ 71.36 and 71.37 may be requested by the officer regardless of the result
of the preliminary breath screening test, if probable cause for an arrest
exists.  The result of the preliminary breath screening test may be used by
the defendant as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving
a violation of §§ 71.35 or 71.36.



(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501.5(a))



§ 71.40  DRIVER INVOLVEMENT IN PERSONAL INJURIES OR FATAL MOTOR VEHICLE
ACCIDENT; CHEMICAL TEST.



   (A)   Any person who drives or is in actual control of a motor
vehicle upon the public highways of the city shall be deemed to have given
consent to a breath test using a portable device as approved by the
Department of State Police  or to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath,
or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol or other drug content of
such person's blood if there is probable cause to believe that such person
was the driver at fault, in whole or in part, for a motor vehicle accident
which resulted in the death or personal injury of any person.  Compliance
with this section does not relieve such person from the requirements of §
71.36.



   (B)   Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a
condition rendering such person incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to
have withdrawn the consent provided by division (A) above.  In addition, if
a driver of a vehicle is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor
vehicle accident, any physician licensed to practice medicine, registered
nurse of a phlebotomist, acting under the direction of a licensed physician
shall withdrawal blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of
alcohol or other drugs, upon the specific request of a law enforcement
officer.  However, no such testing shall be performed until, in the opinion
of the medical personnel on the scene, the withdrawal can be made without
interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.



   (C)   A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall
be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that refusal to
submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol
concentration of 0.08 or more may result in the suspension of such person's
privileges to operate a motor vehicle.



   (D)   If the person refuses testing or submits to a test which
discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, the law enforcement
officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on
a form provided by the Secretary, certifying that the tests or tests were
requested pursuant to division (A) above and the person refused to submit to
a test or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of
0.08 or more.



   (E)   The results of any test or tests administered pursuant to this
section, other than a test conducted with a portable device, may be used in
any civil or criminal action.  Upon the trial of any civil or criminal
action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by
any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while
under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person's
blood or breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's
blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance shall give rise to the
following presumptions:



      (1)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of
0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the
influence of alcohol.



      (2)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in
excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, such facts shall not give rise to any
presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol,
but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining
whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.



      (3)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of
0.08 or more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of
alcohol.



      (4)   The foregoing provisions shall not be construed as
limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the
question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.



   (F)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test under the
provisions of this section, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any
civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have
been committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of
a motor vehicle.



   (G)   For purposes of this section, a personnel injury shall include
any injury that required  immediate professional attention either in a
doctor's office or medical facility.

§ 71.41  YOUTHFUL INTOXICATED DRIVERS' VISITATION PROGRAM.



   (A)   As a condition of probation or discharge of a person convicted
of a violation of § 71.35, who was less than 21 years of age at the time of
the offense, or a person adjudicated delinquent pursuant to the Juvenile
Court Act (ILCS Ch. 705, Act 405, §§ 1-1 et seq.) for violation of §
71.35, the Court may order the offender to participate in the Youthful
Intoxicated Drivers' Visitation Program.  The Program shall consist of a
supervised visitation as provided by this section by the person to at least
one of the following, to the extent that personnel and facilities are
available:



      (1)   A state or private rehabilitation facility that cares
for victims of motor vehicle accidents involving persons under the influence
of alcohol.



      (2)   A facility which cares for advanced alcoholics t observe
persons in the terminal stages of alcoholism, under the supervision of
appropriately licensed medical personnel.



      (3)   If approved by the coroner of the county where the
person resides, the county coroner's office or the county morgue to observe
appropriate victims of motor vehicle accidents involving persons under the
influence of alcohol, under the supervision of the coroner or deputy coroner.



   (B)   The Program shall be operated by the appropriate probation
authorities of the courts of the various circuits.  The youthful offender
ordered to participate in the Program shall bear all costs associated with
participation in the Program.  A parent or guardian of the offender may
assume the obligation of the offender to pay the costs of the Program.  The
court may waive the requirement that the offender pay the costs of
participation in the Program upon a finding of indigency.



   (C)   As used in this section, “appropriate victims” means
victims whose condition is determined by the visit supervisor to demonstrate
the results of motor vehicle accidents involving persons under the influence
of alcohol without being excessively gruesome or traumatic to the observer.

§ 71.42  SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE; PERSONS UNDER AGE 21.



   (A)   A person who is less than 21 years of age and who drives or is
in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of
this city shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or tests
of blood, breath, other bodily substance or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol content of the person’s blood if arrested, as
evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of
the Illinois Vehicle Code or a provision of this chapter, if a police officer
has probable cause to believe that the driver has consumed any amount of an
alcoholic beverage based upon evidence of the driver’s physical condition
or other first-hand knowledge of the police officer.  The test or tests
shall be administered at the direction of the arresting officer.  The law
enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which of the
aforesaid tests shall be administered.  Up to two additional tests of urine
or other bodily substance may be administered even after a blood or breath
test or both has been administered.



   (B)   A person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a
condition rendering that person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to
have withdrawn the consent provided by division (A) of this section and the
test or tests may be administered subject to the following provisions:



      (1)   Chemical analysis of the person’s blood, urine,
breath, or other bodily substance, to be considered valid under the
provisions of this section shall have been performed according to standards
promulgated by the Department of State Police by an individual possessing a
valid permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The Director of
State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to
ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct
analyses, to issue permits that shall be subject to termination or revocation
at the direction of that Department, and to certify the accuracy of breath
testing equipment.  The Department of State Police shall prescribe
regulations as necessary.



      (2)   When a person submits to a blood test at the request of
a law enforcement officer under the provisions of this section, only a
physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician assistant, a
licensed advanced practice nurse, a registered nurse, or other qualified
person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed
physician may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol
content therein.  This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath,
other bodily substance or urine specimens.



      (3)   The person tested may have a physician, qualified
technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of his or
her own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any test
or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer.  The
failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not
preclude the consideration of the previously performed chemical test.



      (4)   Upon a request of the person who submits to a chemical
test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information
concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or that
person's attorney.



      (5)   Alcohol concentration means either grams of alcohol per
100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.



      (6)   If a driver is receiving medical treatment as a result
of a motor vehicle accident, a physician licensed to practice medicine,
licensed physician assistant, licensed advanced practice registered nurse,
registered nurse or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting
under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing
purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol upon the specific request of a
law enforcement officer.  However, that testing shall not be performed
until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can
be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.



   (C)   (1)   A person requested to submit to a test as provided
above shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that
a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an
alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, may result in the loss of that
person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle and may result in the
disqualification of the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor
vehicle, as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-514, if the person is a CDL
holder.  The loss of driving privileges shall be imposed in accordance with
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-208.2.



      (2)   A person requested to submit to a test shall also
acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section.
If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law
enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the
person refused to sign the warning. A person’s refusal to sign the warning
shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.



   (D)   (1)   If person refuses testing or submits to a test that
discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, the law enforcement
officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on
a form prescribed by the Secretary of State,  certifying that  the test or
tests were requested under division (A) and the person refused to submit to a
test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol
concentration of more than 0.00.  The law enforcement officer shall submit
the same sworn report when a person under the age of 21 submits to testing
under § 71.36 and the testing discloses an alcohol concentration of more
than 0.00 and less than 0.08.



      (2)   Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement
officer, the Secretary of State shall enter the suspension and
disqualification on the individual's driving record and the suspension and
disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice
of the suspension was given to the person.  If this suspension is the
individual's first driver's license suspension under this section, reports
received by the Secretary of State under this section shall, except during
the time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use
only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the Secretary
of State or the individual personally, unless the person is a CDL holder, is
operating a commercial motor vehicle or vehicle required to be placarded for
hazardous materials in which case the suspension shall not be privileged.
Reports received by the Secretary of State under this section shall also be
made available to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18
years that holds an instruction permit or a graduated driver's license,
regardless of whether the suspension is in effect.



      (3)   The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report
shall serve immediate notice of this suspension on the person and the
suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following
the date notice was given.



      (4)   In cases where the blood alcohol concentration of more
than 0.00 is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily
substance  or urine, the police officer or arresting agency shall give
notice as provided in this section or by deposit in the United States mail of
that notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to that person
at his or her last known address and the loss of driving privileges shall be
effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.



      (5)   Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement
officer, the Secretary of State shall also give notice of the suspension and
disqualification to the driver by mailing a notice of the effective date of
the suspension and disqualification to the individual.  However should the
sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be
completed in error, the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall
not be mailed to the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the
sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.



   (E)   (1)   A driver may contest this suspension and
disqualification by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary
of State in accordance with ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 2-118.  An individual
whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 is not
subject to this section if he or she consumed alcohol in the performance of a
religious service or ceremony.  An individual whose blood alcohol
concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 shall not be subject to this
section if the individual’s blood alcohol concentration resulted only from
ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine that contained
alcohol.  The petition for that hearing shall not stay or delay the
effective date of the impending suspension.  The scope of this hearing shall
be limited to the issues of:



         (a)   Whether the police officer had probable cause to
believe that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor
vehicle upon the public highways of the city and the police officer had
reason to believe that the person was in violation of any provision of the
Illinois Vehicle Code or the city code of ordinances;



         (b)   Whether the person was issued a Uniform Traffic
Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a provision of a
local ordinance;



         (c)   Whether the police officer had probable cause to
believe that the driver had consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage
based upon the driver's physical actions or other first-hand knowledge of the
police officer;



         (d)   Whether the person, after being advised by the
officer that the privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if
the person refused to submit to and complete the test or tests, did refuse to
submit to or complete the test or tests to determine the person's alcohol
concentration; or



         (e)   Whether the person, after being advised by the
officer that the privileges to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if
the person submits to a chemical test or tests and the test or tests disclose
an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 and the person did submit to and
complete the test or tests that determined an alcohol concentration of more
than 0.00;



         (f)   Whether the test result of an alcohol
concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person's consumption of
alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony; and



         (g)   Whether the test result of an alcohol
concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person's consumption of
alcohol through ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine.



      (2)   At the conclusion of the hearing held under ILCS Ch.
625, Act 5, § 2-118, the Secretary of State may rescind, continue or modify
the suspension and disqualification.  If the Secretary of State does not
rescind the suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving permit may
be granted by the Secretary of State upon application being made and good
cause shown.  A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue
hard-ship by allowing driving for employment, educational and medical
purposes as outlined in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-206(c) item (3).  The
provisions of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-206(c) item (3) and § 6-206(f) shall
apply.  The Secretary of State shall promulgate rules providing for
participation in an alcohol education and awareness program or activity, a
drug education and awareness program or activity or both as a condition to
the issuance of a restricted driving permit for suspensions imposed under
this section.



   (F)   The results of any chemical testing performed in accordance
with division (A) of this section are not admissible in any civil or criminal
proceeding, except that the results of the testing may be considered at a
hearing held under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 2-118.  However, the results of
the testing may not be used to impose driver’s license sanctions under §
71.36.  A law enforcement officer may, however, pursue a statutory summary
suspension or revocation of driving privileges under § 71.36 if other
physical evidence or first-hand knowledge forms the basis of that suspension.



   (G)   This section applies only to drivers who are under age 21 at
the time of the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for a violation of the
Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of this code and a chemical test
request is made under this section.



   (H)   The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, revoking,
canceling, or disqualifying any license or permit shall be subject to
judicial review in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County or in the Circuit
Court of Cook County, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law
(ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq.) and its rules are hereby adopted
and shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review of final
acts or decisions of the Secretary of State under this section.

home as defined in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 1-145.01.  However, the driver of
any such vehicle is prohibited from consuming or having any alcoholic liquor
in or about the driver’s area.  Any evidence of alcoholic consumption by
the driver shall be prima facie evidence of such driver’s failure to obey
this section.  For the purposes of this section, a LIMOUSINE is a motor
vehicle of the first division with the passenger compartment enclosed by a
partition or dividing window used in the for-hire transportation of
passengers and operated by an individual in possession of a valid Illinois
driver’s license of the appropriate classification pursuant to ILCS Ch.
625, Act 5, § 6-104.



   (D)   Any driver who is convicted of violating division (A) of this
section for a second or subsequent time within one year of a similar
conviction shall be subject to suspension of driving privileges as provided
in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-206, paragraph 23, subsection (a).



   (E)   Any driver, who is less than 21 years of age at the date of

emission of smoke, the constituent parts thereof, fly ash, soot, cinders,
toxic and radioactive substances, waste, noxious or obnoxious acids, fumes,
oxides, gases, vapors, odors, dusts, particulate, solid or liquid matter or
any other materials that are of such character as to create atmospheric
pollution, from any stack, chimney, portable boiler, vehicle, process, open
fires, or other source, within the jurisdiction of the Village of South
Elgin; to prohibit emissions of such substances beyond defined limits; to
define a nuisance respecting the same and to provide special limitations or
provisions for processes and equipment with respect to which feasible methods
of measurement and control of emissions have yet to be developed; to provide
for permits for the installation, construction, reconstruction, addition to,
alteration, repair and use of fuel and refuse-burning plants, processes,
equipment and devices, and smoke abatement, dust-arresting and air pollution
control equipment or devices; to regulate the sale, use and consumption of
certain solid fuels; to regulate the sale of equipment and devices; to
provide for inspections and tests of fuel and refuse-burning equipment and
devices, plants processes and for the issuance of permits and certificates of
operation and for fees therefor; to regulate wind-borne sources of air
pollution; to promote research of means and methods of more efficient fuel
combustion and air pollution prevention; to promote an educational program,
in cooperation with interested agencies, both public and private, for air
purification; and to repeal all former ordinances and amendments thereof
relating to air pollution control.



   (B)   The Mayor and Board of Trustees find and determine:



      (1)   Air pollution in all its forms, including smoke, vapors,
noxious odors, dusts, particulates, and wind-borne matter, is a menace to the
health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare of all citizens;



      (2)   Preventable air pollution can be corrected or removed as
a public hazard through intelligent action involving engineering, science,
equipment, research and education; and



      (3)   The excessive emissions of smoke and other air
contaminants are causing atmospheric pollution within the corporate limits of
the village which ought to be abated, and the resultant deleterious effect
upon the public health and welfare, property and business, requires the
adoption of a comprehensive and integrated plan for smoke and air pollution
control.

§ 111.04  TERM OF LICENSE.



   A full license year is from January 1 to December 31.  All licenses
issued under this chapter shall terminate on the 31st day of December

§ 111.05  RENEWAL OF LICENSE.



   (A)   Each licensee shall make application for renewal of his or her
license to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner no later than November 30. 
The application fee and annual fee for the license must accompany this
renewal application.  If the Liquor Control Commissioner determines that the
renewal application contains any information that is changed in any way from
the information set forth in the original application for license, a new
investigation of the licensee shall be undertaken and an additional
application fee of $50 shall be charged to the licensee to cover the costs of
such investigation, and shall be in addition to the renewal application fee
and yearly license fee.  Any applicant that fails to properly submit its
application for renewal to the village on or before November 30 shall be
subject to a fine of $200 payable to the village prior to the issuance or
renewal of the license for the following year.  Should applicant fail to
properly submit its application for renewal on or before December 15, the
aforesaid fine shall be increased to $400.



   (B)   On or prior to November 30 of each calendar year, the Chief of
Police, the Director of Community Development and the Director of Finance
shall, for each licensee seeking renewal, submit a report to the Liquor
Commission concerning any adjudicated violations of the Village Code of
Ordinances for that calendar year and, where applicable, shall include a
statement as to whether the adjudicated violation has been brought into
compliance.  The Chief of Police, Director of Community Development and
Director of Administrative Services shall also submit a report of any unpaid
fines or fees due from each licensee as of the date of the report to the
village. As the obligation to comply with all village ordinances is a
requirement for each license holder, each and every violation and each and
every unpaid fee or fine shall be a basis for the Liquor Commission to decide
not to renew the liquor license of that licensee.



   (C)   If, after investigation, it is determined that the applicant
is not entitled to a renewal license, the yearly license fee shall be
returned.  The charge for the investigation is non-refundable.



   (D)   A renewal license shall be issued provided the licensee is
qualified to receive a license; provided the licensee is in good standing
under all village ordinances or, in the opinion of the Liquor Commission,
will in good faith come into compliance; and provided further that the
premises for which renewal license is sought are suitable for such
purposes.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Village Code of
Ordinances; provided further that the renewal process and privileges set
forth herein provided for do not vest, and shall not he construed as vesting,
any right which shall in any case prevent the corporate authorities from
decreasing the number of licenses to be issued within the village.



   (E)   In the event that the village shall reduce the number of
licenses below that number issued in the prior year and the number of
applicants does not decrease such as to be equal to or less than the number
of available licenses, the Local Liquor Control Commissioner may issue the
available licenses on the basis of date of application, years holding prior
licenses, adequate service to areas in village, record of violation or any
other reasonable basis.

§ 111.06  TRANSFER OF LICENSE.



   (A)   A license shall be a purely personal privilege, good for a
period not to exceed one year after issuance unless sooner terminated or
revoked as provided in this chapter, and shall not constitute property; nor
shall it be subject to attachment, garnishment or execution; nor shall it be
alienable or transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily or subject to being
encumbered or hypothecated.  Such license shall cease upon the death or
dissolution of the licensee, and shall not descend by the laws of the state
or intestate devolution; provided, that executors or administrators of the
estate of any deceased licensee, and the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt
licensee, when such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor, may continue
the business of the sale or manufacture of alcoholic liquor under the order
of the appropriate court, and may exercise the privileges of the deceased or
insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the death of such decedent, or such
insolvency or bankruptcy, until the expiration of such license, but not
longer than six months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such
license.



   (B)   When the licensee is a corporation, the license shall
terminate upon dissolution or whenever 50% or more of the ownership interest
therein changes from that shown on the original license application.  In
such event, the corporation or limited liability company, through its
officers, must make application for the issuance of a new license as provided
herein; provided, however, that the provisions of this division shall not
apply where the transfer of an ownership interest is made to an owner shown
on the original license application who owned 50% or more of the ownership
interest of such corporation at the time the original license application was
filed with the village.



('81 Code, § 5-2.09)  (Ord. 1982-4-5-2.09, passed 1-18-82; Am. Ord.
2003-91, passed 11-17-03)



§ 111.07  CHANGE OF INFORMATION OR LOCATION.



   (A)   If any persons or information identified on the application
submitted to the village for a new or renewal license shall no longer be
accurate or changes (e.g., the liquor manager or the person upon whom service
may be made within the village limits), then the licensee shall notify the
village of the change in information no later than seven calendar days after
the change occurred. It shall also no longer be permissible for a licensee to
impose a hold order or forwarding order for mail service for any person
identified in the application as the persons to receive notices or mail.
Failure to timely and properly notify the village of changes in the
information submitted in the application shall subject the licensee to
possible discipline by the Liquor Commission as set forth in this chapter.



   (B)   Licenses issued by the Local Liquor Control Commissioner apply
only to the premises described in the application and in the license issued
hereon, and only one location shall be so described in each license.  After
a license has been granted for the particular premises, the Local Liquor
Control Commissioner upon proper showing may endorse upon said license
permission to abandon the premises therein described and remove therefrom to
the other premises approved by said Local Liquor Control Commissioner, but in
order to obtain such approval, the licensee shall file with the State Liquor
Commission and the Local Liquor Control Commissioner a request in writing and
a statement, under oath, which shall show that the premises to which removal
is to be made comply in all respects with the requirements of this chapter,
the laws of the State of Illinois and all rules made in pursuance thereof.



(‘81 Code, § 5-2.10)  (Ord. 1982-4-5-2.10, passed 1-18-82; Am. Ord.
2003-91, passed 11-17-03; Am. Ord. 2007-60, passed 10-15-07)



§ 111.08  REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE; HEARING PROCEDURE.



   (A)   The Local Liquor Control Commissioner may, in accordance with
law and the provisions of the Liquor Control Act, revoke or suspend any
license issued under the authority of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner,
and shall impose a fine against any licensee in the amount of $1,000 per
violation, absent good and sufficient cause shown for any reduction in such
fine, if the Commissioner determines that the licensee has violated any
provisions of said Act, state law, any municipal ordinance or resolution, or
any applicable rule or regulation established by the Liquor Control
Commissioner which is not inconsistent with law.  For the purposes of this
section, every licensee shall be deemed responsible for the unlawful acts of
its agents or employees whether or not such licensee knowingly permits or has
actual knowledge of such unlawful acts.  For any subsequent violation of any
provision of the Liquor Code by the same licensee within a 12-month period,
the fine imposed for such subsequent violations shall be as follows: for the
second violation in a 12-month period, a fine not to exceed $1,500; for the
third and subsequent violations in a 12-month period, a fine not to exceed
$2,500.  Each day on which a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation.  Not more than $15,000 in fines may be imposed against any
licensee during the period of his or her license.  Proceeds from any fines
shall be paid into the general corporate fund of the village.



   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (C) below, no license
shall be revoked or suspended, and no licensee fined, except after a public
hearing before the Local Liquor Control Commission, with no less than a
three-day written notice to the licensee, affording the licensee an
opportunity to appear and defend.  The notice shall apprise the licensee of
the nature of the violation and the date, time and location of the
preliminary hearing; however, the notice of violation may be amended during
the preliminary hearing or any subsequent hearing to conform the charges to
the evidence presented.  Notice shall be served either by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or by the South Elgin Police Department.  A record
of the hearing shall be made by a certified court reporter, and all witnesses
shall testify under oath administered by the Local Liquor Commissioner.



      (2)   At the preliminary hearing, the licensee may stipulate
to the violation or may request a full hearing on the merits.  Any requested
full hearing shall be scheduled at such date and time as the Local Liquor
Control Commission shall find convenient, and may schedule such a hearing
during the business day or during reasonable evening hours, and written
notice of such date and time provided to the licensee no less than three days
prior to the date of the full hearing.  The Local Liquor Control
Commissioner shall serve as the hearing officer and rule upon questions of
evidence and procedure. The Local Liquor Control Commissioner shall rule upon
objections and evidentiary questions, with the understanding that such
rulings must be consistent with fundamental fairness, but need not be in
strict compliance with the Illinois Supreme Court, Illinois Code of Civil
Procedure, or any local rules of evidence governing a civil judicial trial in
the State of Illinois.



   (C)   If the Local Liquor Control Commissioner has reason to believe
that any continued operation of a particular licensed premises will
immediately threaten the welfare of the community, the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner may, upon the issuance of a written order, order the premises
closed for not more than seven days, giving the licensee an opportunity to be
heard during that period; except that if such licensee shall also be engaged
in the conduct of another business or businesses on the licensed premises,
such order shall not be applicable to such other business or businesses.



   (D)   The Local Liquor Control Commission shall, within three days
of the hearing, submit findings and recommendations to the Local Liquor
Control Commissioner setting forth the Commission's conclusions regarding the
existence and nature of any violation of the village code and recommending
the appropriate disciplinary action to be taken, if any.  Not later than
five days after the hearing, the Local Liquor Control Commissioner shall
enter a written order setting forth his or her findings, the reasons for such
determination, and the discipline to be imposed, if any, and shall serve a
copy of such order upon the licensee within five business days.



   (E)   The following provisions of the Liquor Control Act, ILCS Ch.
235, Act 5, are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
chapter:  §§ 7-7, 7-9, 7-12, and 7-13.  Review of decisions of the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner shall be as provided for ILCS Ch. 235, Act 5, §
7-9.



   (F)   When any license has been revoked for any cause, no license
shall be granted to any person for the period of one year thereafter for the
conduct of the business of manufacturing, distributing, or selling alcoholic
liquor in the premises described in such revoked license, unless the
revocation order has been vacated or unless the revocation order was entered
as to the licensee only.

   The village hereby imposes a simplified telecommunications tax upon the
act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in the village
intrastate or interstate telecommunications by a person under the provisions
of the simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (ILCS Ch. 35, Act 636,
§ 5-1 et seq.) at the rate of 3% of the gross charges for such
telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. However, such tax is
not imposed on such act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may
not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the
subject of taxation by municipalities in this state. To prevent actual
multi-municipal and/or multi- state taxation of the act or privilege that is
subject to taxation under this division, any taxpayer, upon proof that the
taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality or state on such event, shall
be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section, to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in
such other municipality or state which was not previously allowed as a credit
against any other municipality, state or local tax in this state.

§ 120.21  COLLECTION.



   The tax authorized by § 120.20 shall be collected from the taxpayer by
a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the Illinois Department of Revenue. Any tax
required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this subchapter, and
any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the
Department, shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state.
Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the
gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the
Department. The tax authorized by this subchapter shall constitute a debt of
the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at
law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the
retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall
be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the manner provided
by the Department.

until January 1, 2009.



   (J)   Every licensee or tow driver shall remove or cause to be
removed all glass and debris deposited on any street or highway by the
vehicle being serviced. The licensee or tow driver shall also spread oil-dry
upon that portion of any street or highway where any fluids have been
deposited by the vehicle being serviced, unless the Fire Department has taken
charge of the cleanup, at which point the licensee will follow the
instructions of Fire Department personnel regarding cleanup.



   (K)   While at the scene of any call for a license tow, every
license tow driver will wear safety apparel compliant with the Class 2 or 3
standard of the International Safety Equipment Association standard:
ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 (as amended) standard for high visibility safety apparel,
as appropriate to the task being performed and the conditions present.



   (L)   While at the scene of any call for a license tow, every
license tow driver will wear outer apparel that clearly identifies the
company for which they work and the tow driver's first name. The name of the
tow driver shall be on the front of their apparel. This identification must
be able to be read by a person with normal vision at a distance of at least
ten feet. This identification can be incorporated into the requirement for
high visibility safety apparel.



   (M)   No licensee or tow driver shall respond to a license call for
service while having any alcohol, controlled substances, or both in their
system. They shall also not have prescribed or over the counter medication in
their system that renders them incapable of safely driving or operating the
tow truck



   (N)   All licensees shall comply with § 121.11.

§ 121.07  OPERATION OF POLICE TOWING LICENSEE LISTS.



   (A)   The Police Department will maintain three police towing
licensee lists, as follows:



      (1)   Light duty.



      (2)   Medium duty.



      (3)   Heavy duty.



   (B)   The Police Department will ensure that licensees are called in
rotation as far as is reasonable and practicable. Except upon request of the
owner, operator or person legitimately in possession of the vehicle to be
serviced, the Police Department will not call any tow truck not on the police
towing licensee list unless all such licensees are unavailable.



   (C)   The Police Department may deviate from the order of normal
rotation if, in the Police Department's judgment, deviation is necessary to
protect the public health, safety, and/or welfare or to ensure proper
traffic, incident, or accident management. The Police Department may also
deviate from the order of normal rotation if the licensee next on rotation
is, in the Police Department's sole discretion and judgment, incapable or
improperly equipped for handling a specific task.



   (D)   If a licensee is unable to respond to a request for service
within the time frames required in the towing license agreement, the licensee
or their employee shall advise the Police Department that they are not
available due to an extended response time. The licensee will then be placed
at the bottom of the list. No substitute tow company or licensee will be
allowed. The police telecommunicator will then call the next licensee on the
list.



   (E)   When a request for service is canceled after being dispatched
off the police towing licensee list, the licensee will be put back at the top
of the list.



   (F)   The village reserves the right to terminate or modify its
license procedure unilaterally at any time without any notice and without
recourse.



(Ord. 2007-41, passed 7-16-07)



§ 121.08  LICENSE NON-TRANSFERABLE.



   Any license granted pursuant to this chapter shall be personal to the
individual or entity to whom issued and may not be transferred to any other
person or entity. Such license shall not be sold, leased, transferred,
assigned, or otherwise disposed of, either in whole or in part, whether by
forced sale, merger, consolidation, bankruptcy, reorganization under
bankruptcy laws, or otherwise, without reapplication pursuant to § 121.02.

§ 121.09  REMOVAL FROM POLICE TOWING LICENSEE LIST.



   (A)   Removal of licensee.  The Chief of Police, or designee, may
remove any licensee temporarily or permanently when it is determined that:



      (1)   The license was secured by fraud or concealment of a
material fact, which if known would have caused disapproval of the
application.



      (2)   The licensee has violated any of the provisions of this
chapter, or the Police Department towing license agreement.



      (3)   The service provided by the licensee has been
substantially inadequate, which shall include, but not be limited to, failing
to be available for or not accepting calls, slow response time, excessive
damage claims, theft, repeated complaints from citizens, inadequate services
or towing equipment.



      (4)   During the term of the license, any licensee or a tow
driver:



         (a)   Is convicted of any felony in any state;



         (b)   Is determined to be a sex offender, as defined in
ILCS Ch. 730, Act 150, § 2, as amended; or



         (c)   Is convicted under the laws of Illinois or any
other state of an offense that under the laws of the state would be a felony
theft of a vehicle or vehicle parts.



   (B)   Temporary removal.  If the removal of the licensee from the
police towing licensee list is temporary, such temporary removal shall not be
for more than 30 days at any one time.



   (C)   Pending suspension/removal.  If the Chief of Police, or
designee, determines the alleged offense does not constitute an immediate
threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, the Chief of Police
shall provide the licensee with written notice at least 15 days prior to the
effective date of the temporary or permanent removal by delivering said
notice to the licensee's place of business. Said written notice shall include:



      (1)   The effective date of the removal.



      (2)   Whether the removal is temporary or permanent.



      (3)   The allegations which form the basis of the removal.



      (4)   The actions, if any, the licensee may take to prevent
the removal from occurring.



      (5)   The procedure that the licensee must follow to request a
hearing to appeal the removal.



   (D)   Immediate suspension/removal.



      (1)   If the Chief of Police, or designee, determines that a
licensee presents an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of the
public, or if the licensee has not provided proof of valid insurance in the
amounts required by ordinance, the Chief of Police shall provide the licensee
with written notice that the licensee is being removed from the police towing
licensee list immediately. Said written notice shall be delivered to the
licensee's place of business on the first day the removal is effective, and
shall state:



         (a)   That the removal is effective immediately.



         (b)   Whether the removal is temporary or permanent.



         (c)   The allegations which form the basis of the
removal.



         (d)   The actions, if any, the licensee may take to be
reinstated.



         (e)   The procedure that the licensee must follow to
request a hearing to appeal the removal.



      (2)   If a hearing is requested, the Village Administrator, or
the Village Administrator's designee shall act as the hearing officer. The
hearing shall be informal and provide both sides with the opportunity to
present all evidence relevant to the removal. The hearing officer shall issue
a written decision based upon a preponderance of the presented evidence
within seven days of the hearing. The opinion shall be sent to the licensee's
business address, with a copy retained in the licensee's application file at
the Police Department.  If the decision favors the licensee, the hearing
officer shall notify the Police Department so that license towing privileges
may be reinstated as soon as possible. The village or the licensee may
contest the decision of the hearing officer in any manner provided by law.



   (E)   Method of requesting hearing.  A licensee must request a
hearing by calling the Village Administrator's office within ten days of
receiving a notice of suspension or removal and scheduling a hearing. 
Leaving a message with the Village Administrator's office will not satisfy
this requirement.  The Village Administrator's office must provide a time
for the hearing that is within 72 hours of the request, provided there is one
complete business day within the 72 hour time period. If there is no complete
village business day in the 72 hour period, the hearing shall be held on the
first village business day after the 72 hour time period. If the licensee is
unavailable at the time provided by the village, the village shall not be
bound by the 72 hour time period and the removal will not be stayed. If the
village is unable to provide a hearing time within the applicable time
period, all action on the removal shall be stayed until the hearing.

   For the purposes of this title, the following words and phrases shall
have the following meanings ascribed to them respectively.



   ACT.  The taking of action or a failure or omission to take action. 



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-2)



   ANOTHER.  A person or persons other than the offender. 



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-3)



   CONDUCT.  An act or a series of acts, and the accompanying mental
state. 



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-4)



   OFFENSE.  A violation of a penal statute of this village or state. 



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-12)



§ 130.02  INTENT.



   A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a
result or engage in conduct described by the section defining the offense,
when his conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or
engage in that conduct.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-4)



§ 130.03  KNOWLEDGE.



   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:



      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her
conduct, described by the section defining the offense, when he or she is
consciously aware that his or her conduct is of that nature or that those
circumstances exist.  Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the
substantial probability that the fact exists.



      (2)   The result of his or her conduct, described by the
section defining the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that that
result is practically certain to be caused by his conduct.

(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-5)



§ 130.04  RECKLESSNESS.



   A person is reckless or acts recklessly, when he consciously disregards
a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that a
result will follow, described by the section defining the offense; and such
disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.  An act performed
recklessly is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a section using the
latter term, unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-6)

be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or
a result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense; and that
failure constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.

attempt when, with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any
act that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.



   (B)   Impossibility. It is not a defense to a charge of attempt that
because of a misapprehension of the circumstances it would have been
impossible for the accused to commit the offense attempted.



   (C)   A person convicted of attempt may be fined not to exceed the
maximum provided for the offense attempted.  If such fine exceeds that set
forth in § 130.99 below, however, the village shall enforce said offense
under the provisions of state law.



(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 8-4)  Penalty, see § 130.99



§ 130.99  PENALTY.

or occupant that the entry is forbidden or remains upon or in the area after
receiving notice from the owner or occupant to depart.



      (2)   For purposes of this division (A), this section shall
not apply to being in a building which is open to the public while the

reasonable belief that the building is still open to the public.



   (B)   A person has received notice from the owner or occupant within
the meaning of division (A) if the person has been notified personally,
either orally or in writing, including a valid court order as defined by ILCS

         (b)   A post capped or otherwise marked on at least its
top two inches. The bottom of the cap or mark shall be not less than three
feet but not more than five feet six inches high. Posts so marked shall be

all such owners or lessees shall concur in the decision to post their own
property.



         (c)   Nothing in this division (B)(1) shall be construed
to authorize the owner or lessee of any real property to place any purple
marks on any tree or post or to install any post or fence if doing so would
violate any applicable law, rule, ordinance, order, covenant, bylaw,
declaration, regulation, restriction, contract, or instrument.



      (2)   Any owner or lessee who marks his or her real property
using the method described in division (B)(1) of this section must also

      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value.



      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section,
evidence shall be admissible to show:

mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for
reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of
obscene material.

other than children under 18 years of age;



      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   DEVELOPMENT.   See § 151.02 of this Code.



   FEN.   A specific area containing calcareous wetland. This area occurs
on a hill slope with a steady flow of groundwater rich in calcium and
magnesium bicarbonates, which turn the soil highly alkaline. These conditions
are tolerated by a relatively small number of plants termed "calciphiles."
Calcareous fens supports a large number of rare, threatened or endangered
plant species.



   GROUNDWATER AQUIFER.   The water bearing stratum or formation capable
of transmitting water in qualities sufficient to produce a near-constant
discharge in the hill slope at a fen.



   GROUNDWATER RECHARGE ZONE.   Land areas effective either currently or
in the past in supplying water of the correct chemistry to support a
calcareous fen to the aquifers forming the hill slope surface discharge at a
fen.



(Ord. 2000-62, passed 12-4-00)



§ 155.03  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Fen groundwater recharge zones shall be those areas as
designated by the Village Engineer, or the applicant's technical
professionals as approved by the Village Engineer, and kept on file as a
public record, and amended from time-to-time as provided in § 155.05.



   (B)   No development or alteration of surface or subsurface drainage
characteristics within a fen groundwater recharge zone shall occur unless
such development or alteration is consistent with the technical requirements
of this chapter.



   (C)   Developments shall not decrease the quantity or quality of
groundwater flow to a fen except as required or allowed by this chapter.
Appropriate standard hydrologic parameter estimation techniques may be
utilized to evaluate the effect of a proposed development, including but not
limited to NRCS (SCS) curb numbers or HSPS modeling of the rainfall/ runoff/
abstraction relationships.



   (D)   This chapter shall be cumulative with any other stormwater
management or land use related ordinances applying to development within the
village.



   (E)   All permitted land uses, changes in zoning, and all annexation
agreements shall be consistent with limiting total impervious surfaces
applicable upon development. Land uses in a fen groundwater recharge zone
which generate impervious surfaces greater than 25% of the total land area of
any development shall not be allowed without performing hydrologic,
geological and geotechnical studies defining the impact to groundwater flow
and chemistry. Such impacts shall be mitigated to maintain or reestablish, as
much as practicable given the condition of the land as of the date of this
chapter is adopted and approved, the pre-development groundwater flow rates
and chemistry at a fen as determined by the Village Engineer.



(Ord. 2000-62, passed 12-4-00)



§ 155.04  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT.



   (A)   The following technical standards shall apply to all land uses
in a fen groundwater recharge zone which generate impervious surfaces greater
than 25% of the total land area of any development:



      (1)   Stormwater storage.



         (a)   The runoff from the roadways and roadside ditches
shall be collected and conveyed to facilities designed for the storage of
stormwater in accordance with applicable village ordinances. The facilities
shall be designed so that they are lined so that infiltration into the
groundwater zone is inhibited and the discharge from these ponds shall be
conveyed to suitable discharge points directly to the stream system or to
municipally maintained stormwater conveyance facilities or to privately
maintained stormwater conveyance facilities as approved by the village.



         (b)   These stormwater storage facilities shall be
vegetated in a manner to promote chemical and biological activity using the
best methods known and available at the time of development to remove typical
urban pollutants such as chlorides and common plant nutrients.



         (c)   Open spaces that are vegetated, such as parkland,
shall be maintained in a manner that promotes the infiltration of runoff to
the maximum extent practical. These measures can include preparation of the
soils by deep plowing and discing and the planting of deep-rooted native
vegetation appropriate for the purposes outlined.



      (2)   Stormwater conveyance.



         (a)   To the maximum extent  practicable, stormwater
discharges from roadways, roadside ditches, and hydraulically connected paved
surfaces shall be conveyed separately from the stormwater runoff from open
space and vegetated lawns. Conveyance of stormwater runoff from the open
space, vegetated lawns, and other unpaved surfaces shall be accomplished by
means generally described as "best management" practices and shall include
vegetative swales and open channel flow in order to promote infiltration of
stormwater from these areas into the groundwater recharge zones.



         (b)   The conveyance of the separated stormwater runoff
from roadways, roadside ditches and hydraulically connected paved surfaces
shall be designed to contain flows up to, as a minimum, the ten-year flood
flow rate. Flows which exceed the ten-year flood flow rate follow overland
flow paths that are combined with the stormwater runoff from other vegetated
areas of the site.



      (3)   Development criteria.



         (a)   Utility construction and excavations will be done
in such a way so as to least alter the movement of groundwater towards a fen,
as determined by the Village Engineer. Mass grading of the site shall be
minimized and only in accordance with the geotechnical investigation to
define the effect of the mass grading on the movement of groundwater.



         (b)   Areas within the boundaries of recharge zones
which have been substantially altered prior to the effective date of this
chapter so that they no longer function or inadequately function to recharge
groundwater to a fen shall also be subject to the technical requirements of
this chapter when approved for development, including but not limited to
restoration of the recharge functions to these areas, but not to the extent
of attempting to reconstruct aquifers; provided, however, that the
alterations were completed in accordance with activities permitted by the
village.



(Ord. 2000-62, passed 12-4-00)



§ 155.05  ESTABLISHMENT OR AMENDMENT OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE DISTRICT.



   (A)   The applicant shall be responsible for establishing whether or
not the subject property is part of the groundwater recharge zone for a fen,
unless the village has already determined the boundary of the recharge zone.
The following shall be used to determine whether or not the subject property
is within a fen groundwater recharge zone:



      (1)   Existing stratigraphic maps may be used to determine the
likelihood of a property being within a recharge zone.



      (2)   Where maps or site geotechnical studies show that the
geologic conditions are suitable for groundwater recharge, a detailed
hydrogeologic study shall be performed which will include a minimum of two
groundwater monitoring wells or a number of wells sufficient to establish the
direction of groundwater flow with bi-weekly monitoring for a one year period
unless a shorter period is approved which will capture seasonal variation in
groundwater. The purpose of monitoring is to establish the direction of
groundwater movement.



   Should it be determined that groundwater movement is in the direction
of the fen, then the subject property shall be included in the groundwater
recharge zone. If these studies show that the movement of groundwater is not
in the direction of the fen, the property shall not be included in the
recharge protection zone.



   The Village Engineer shall review and approve all studies for this
purpose and shall make all final determinations as to groundwater recharge
zone boundaries.



   (B)   A fen groundwater recharge zone may be amended from
time-to-time to exclude those areas which do not naturally function to
recharge groundwater based on further scientific study and research and
further monitoring of groundwater and surface water discharges. Amendment may
occur only if the applicant can show with scientific study and groundwater
monitoring that areas included within the fen groundwater recharge zone are
not effective in promoting the groundwater hydrology of the fen. Studies for
this purpose shall be reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer.



(Ord. 2000-62, passed 12-4-00)



§ 155.06  REQUIRED STUDIES AND DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA.



   Any applicant for a development which will generate impervious surfaces
greater than 25% in a fen groundwater recharge zone shall be required to
perform detailed geotechnical and hydrogeological investigations of the site
and shall submit the results of this study with his application for
development. These geotechnical studies shall further define the location and
depth of the upper and lower groundwater aquifers occurring within the
development site. These studies shall analyze the effects of excavation
within the development on movement of groundwater towards a fen. The studies
shall also analyze the effect of all property development to date on
groundwater movement.

its subsequent amendments, that use shall be deemed a lawful special use. Any
subsequent addition, enlargement, or expansion of that use shall conform to
this Ordinance's requirements for special uses.



3.   Special Uses Rendered Permitted Uses. If a use was classified as a
special use prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and is classified
as a permitted use as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or its
subsequent amendments, that use shall be deemed a lawful permitted use. Any
subsequent addition, enlargement, or expansion of that use shall conform to
this Ordinance's requirements for such permitted use and is no longer subject
to the special use ordinance under which it was originally approved.



4.   Uses Rendered Legally Nonconforming. If a use was classified as a
permitted or special use prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and
this Ordinance no longer classifies that use as either a permitted or special
use in the zoning district in which it is located, that use shall be deemed a
legal nonconforming use and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section
156.11 (Nonconformities).



5.   Structures and Lots Rendered Legally Nonconforming. If a structure or
lot existing on the effective date of this Ordinance was conforming or

structure or lot does not meet all standards set forth in this Ordinance,
that structure or lot shall be deemed legally nonconforming and shall be
controlled by the provisions of Section 156.11 (Nonconformities).



6.   Previously Issued Building Permits. If a building permit for a
building or structure was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, and if construction has begun within six months after the issuance
of that permit and diligently pursued to completion, the structure may be
completed based on the previously issued building permit, and may be occupied
under a certificate of occupancy for the use originally intended upon
completion. If the use was classified as a permitted or special use prior to
the effective date of this Ordinance, and this Ordinance no longer classifies
that use as either a permitted or special use in the zoning district in which
it is located, that use shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use and shall
be controlled by the provisions of Section 156.11 (Nonconformities).



7.   Previously Granted Special Uses and Variations. All special uses and
variations granted prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall remain
in effect. The recipient of the special use or variation may proceed to
develop the property in accordance with the plans and any applicable
conditions approved by the Village Board. If the recipient has failed to act
on the special use or variation before the approval expires, including any
periods of extension granted, the provisions of this Ordinance shall govern.

         (e)   No security reduction request shall be approved
unless the request is accompanied by the Village Engineer's certificate

street cross slope shall be provided.



            i.   This cross slope shall be carried back beyond
the crosswalk of the intersecting street each way from the intersection of
the two centerlines.



            ii.   An allowance of 2% maximum intersection
grade shall be permitted.



   c.   Curb Radii. The following curb radii shall be utilized unless
otherwise authorized by the Zoning Administrator, in consultation with the
Village Engineer.



      (1)   Design Vehicle Used. Intersections shall be designed
using the minimum design vehicle that accommodates the street users. The
design vehicle used shall consider and balance the needs of the various users
of the street, including pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles, and the
volume and frequency of these users.



         (a)   Corner Radii. Intersections shall be designed for
the effective turning radius of the chosen design vehicle, as opposed to the
actual curb radius, as illustrated in Figure 156.04.C-C. Effective Right Turn
Radius, in accordance with § 156.04.C.3 (Street Type Design Standards).



Figure 156.04.C-C. Effective Right Turn Radius







 



   d.   Crosswalks. Crosswalks shall be required at all intersections.



      (1)   Dimensions. Crosswalks shall be a minimum of six feet in
width, measured from mid-stripe to mid-stripe, per the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices.



      (2)   Markings. Crosswalks shall be appropriately indicated on
the finished street surface with highly visible painted markings and/or
textured or colored pavement, in accordance with the South Elgin Engineering
Design & Inspection Policy Manual.



      (3)   Crossing Distances. To encourage pedestrian activity and
safety, pavement width at crosswalks shall not extend over 38 feet without
intervening installation of a median pedestrian refuge, curb extensions, or
other acceptable pedestrian refuge area, that reduce the pedestrian crossing
distance to less than 38 feet. Refer to Figure 156.04.C-D. Pedestrian
Crossing Distances.



Figure 156.04.C-D. Pedestrian Crossing Distances







 



      (4)   Required Median Pedestrian Refuge. Regardless of
pavement width, at any intersection requiring a pedestrian to cross more than
three lanes of vehicle travel, a median pedestrian refuge shall be installed
to provide adequate pedestrian safety. The refuge cut-through or ramp width
shall equal the width of the crosswalk. Refer to Figure 156.04.C-E. Median
Pedestrian Refuge Design.



Figure 156.04.C-E. Median Pedestrian Refuge Design







 



   e.   Curb Extensions. Curb extensions shall be installed at the
intersections of all street types that contain an on-street parking lane
adjacent to the curb, to support pedestrian activity at corners and shorten
crossing distances. Curb extensions may contain landscaped bioretention cells
to facilitate stormwater infiltration and meet the requirements of §
156.04.C.3.c (Stormwater Management Facilities).



      (1)   Accessible Ramps and Warning Panels. Accessible ramps
and warning panels are required where all sidewalks or trails terminate at a
crosswalk or curb, per the Americans with Disabilities Act or any more
stringent state requirement. Two ramps per corner at intersecting streets are
required and shall be oriented perpendicular to traffic.



      (2)   Curbs and Gutters. The dimensions and materials of all
curbs, driveway curbs, and gutter installations shall be determined in
consultation with the Village Engineer.



2.   Street Type Design Standards.



   a.   General Street Type Standards.



      (1)   Applicability. This Section establishes street types
that depict acceptable street configurations to be applied to all new streets
within subdivisions. The Zoning Administrator, in consultation with the
Village Engineer, may require additions or reductions to the right-of-way,
pavement width, or additional street elements depending on unique site
characteristics. Refer to Table 156.04.C-A. General Street Type Standards,
which summarizes the requirements of each street type.



      (2)   Graphics. The graphics provided to illustrate each
street type are examples of potential configurations of that street type.
Other configurations may be deemed acceptable by the Zoning Administrator, in
consultation with the Village Engineer.



      (3)   Typical Street Elements. Typical elements of a street
are divided into the vehicle and pedestrian realms. Each street type detailed
in this Section identifies which facilities are applicable. Refer to Figure
156.04.C-F. Typical Right-of-Way Elements.

   b.   Bicycle Facilities. Three types of bicycle facilities are
permitted in the vehicle realm. One off-street bicycle facility is permitted
within the pedestrian realm. Refer to Figure 156.04.C-G. Bicycle Facilities.



      (1)   Dedicated Bicycle Lane. Dedicated bicycle lanes are
striped lanes on the outside of the outermost vehicular travel lanes that are
designated for bicycle use. This lane occurs on both sides of the street and
shall be a minimum of five feet wide.



      (2)   Designated Shared Lane. A designated shared lane is a
lane that is shared by vehicles and bicycles. This designated shared lane
shall be a minimum of 14 feet wide, which is wider than a standard vehicle
lane in order to accommodate both vehicles and cyclists. The designated
shared lane shall include a painted bicycle marker combined with a double
arrow (known as a "sharrow" or "shared lane marking"). On two-way streets, a
designated shared lane is required in both directions.



      (3)   Shared Lane. A shared lane refers to a street that does
not have dedicated bicycle lanes or designated shared lanes, but the speed
and configuration of the street allows bicycles to comfortably share lanes
with traffic and appropriate signage installed within the right-of-way to
clearly establish that the land is a bicycle route.



      (4)   Sidepath. A sidepath is an off-street facility that is
shared between pedestrians and bicycles. This path functions like a sidewalk
but is wide enough to accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians simultaneously.
Sidepaths are required on both sides of the street and shall be a minimum of
ten feet wide. At the Zoning Administrator's discretion, one sidepath on a
single side of the street may be allowed, provided the sidepath is a minimum
of 12 feet wide.



Figure 156.04.C-G. Bicycle Facilities







 



   c.   Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management
facilities shall be integrated within the right-of-way as part of the design
of all street types in the VC District to help clean and infiltrate
stormwater runoff in accordance with the following requirements and, at the
discretion of the Village, may be integrated within the right-of-way as part
of the design of all street types in all other districts. Examples of such
facilities are illustrated in this Section (refer to Figure 156.04.C-H.
Bioswale Design, Figure 156.04.C-I. Bioretention Planter Design, and Figure
156.04.C-J. Bioretention Curb Extension Design).



      (1)   Bioswales, bioretention planters, or other stormwater
management best management practices (BMPs) accepted by the Village Engineer
shall be installed within all new parkways in the VC District and, at the
discretion of the Village, may be installed within new parkways in other
districts.



      (2)   Bioretention cells, at the discretion of the Village,
may be included within curb extensions at intersections for all street types
when a parking lane is adjacent to the parkway. Cells may extend into the
parkway.

shall be required to contribute to the costs incurred in meeting these needs.



2.   Applicability. The requirements of this Section shall apply to the
following:



   a.   New residential subdivisions.



   b.   New residential planned developments.



   c.   Any annexation of land.



3.   Total Donation Required Per Development. The developer is required to
dedicate land or to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land and remit
any fees as established in this Section, according to the formula set forth
in Table 156.04.E-A. Determination of Total Donation Per Development. The
donation of land to meet requirements is preferred, and cash contributions in
lieu of actual land should only be accepted when unique inability to provide
suitable land is demonstrated.



Table 156.04.E-A. Determination of Total Donation Per Development



 

Total Donation = Total Park Donation + Total School Donation + Other Cash
Contributions


Total Park Donation = (AD in land donated) or (AD x FMV) + (AD x IIF)


Total School Donation = (AD in land donated) or (AD x FMV) + (AD x IIF)


AD = Acreage demand based on population generated by the development


FMV = Fair market value, adopted average cost per acre to purchase land


IIF = Initial improvements fee per acre, adopted to fund improvements of
areas and facilities



 



4.   Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit. The ultimate population
density generated by a subdivision, planned unit development, or annexation
of land shall be based on the projections set forth in Table 156.04.E-B.
Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, and used in calculating the amounts of

   a.   General Provisions.



      (1)   Conveyance of Land. Required land donations shall be
provided per the requirements of §156.04.E.6 (Conveyance of Site).



      (2)   Cash Donations. Required cash donations shall be
provided per the requirements of §156.04.E.9 (Cash Donations).



      (3)   Phasing. The improvement of all donated park land sites
shall be completed by the developer before 20% of the certificates of
occupancy have been issued, but in no event later than three years after the
date-of-issuance for the first building permit issued for the development.



   b.   Land Donation Calculation.



      (1)   Park Acreage Requirement. The amount of required park
land shall be determined by the ultimate density of the proposed development.
For parks, 10.5 acres of park land per 1,000 residents shall be donated.



      (2)   Land Donation Formula. The following formula determines
how many acres are required to be donated: The total number of units for each
dwelling type to be built is multiplied by the corresponding population
density in Table 156.04.E-B. Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, and the
product for each dwelling type is added to calculate the ultimate population
of the development. The total ultimate population for all dwelling units is
then divided by 1,000. The result of such division is then multiplied by 10.5
to determine total acreage needed for park land donation.



   c.   Initial Improvements Fee. In addition to the land donation set
forth above (or the cash contribution in lieu thereof), subject developments
shall be required to donate a sum of money for park site improvement costs.
In order to provide for the improvement of areas and facilities to serve the
residents of the dwelling units proposed, an initial improvements fee of
$30,000 per acre of required park land donation is necessary.



   d.   Criteria for Required Park Land Donation.



      (1)   General Uses. The park land donation site must be
suitable for the active park and recreation purposes for which it is
intended, and shall be integral components of the neighborhood, not
set-asides or left over parcels. The 10.5 acres of park land required per
1,000 of estimated population shall be generally divided among the various
active park areas in accordance with the following classification:

5.0




 



      (2)   Location.



         (a)   Parks shall be located no further than a 1,320
feet walking distance from every lot in the subdivision, to allow all users
pedestrian access within an approximate five minute walk, and located so as
to be accessible and largely visible from public streets and the surrounding
neighborhood.



         (b)   The slope, topography, and geology of the donated
site shall be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.



         (c)   The Village shall retain final selection and
approval authority for all park site locations.



      (3)   Compatibility with Current Plans. The elements of the
comprehensive plan, park and open space plans, and plans for unincorporated
lands will be used to guide the location of park sites. Land donation will
only be accepted in those instances where a subdivider owns land in
reasonable proximity to a planned future park site or is comparable thereto.
In all other cases, the payment of fees in lieu of actual land is required.



      (4)   Condition of Donated Land. Donated land shall be in a
condition ready for facility development including proper site drainage and
curb and gutter treatment in a manner consistent with the balance of the
development. Original topsoil and vegetative cover shall either remain
undisturbed or the site shall be prepared with topsoil, fine-graded, and
seeded in a manner consistent with the balance of the development.



   b.   Park Land Donation Substitutions.



      (1)   Fee In Lieu. If it is determined that park land would be
more appropriately located off-site, per the requirements of § 156.04.E.9
(Cash Donations), the Village may agree to accept cash in lieu of land.



      (2)   Off-Site Park Land Donations. At the sole discretion of
the Village, off-site park land may be accepted to meet up to 50% of the
total required park land donation provided such land is accessible to the
community, and advances Village goals to naturalize floodprone properties,
and transition to passive recreation use, or to increase conservation areas
that link and extend greenways. Prior to acceptance of such donation, all
structures shall be removed from the subject property, all utilities
disconnected, and all land restored to the appropriate natural cover and
condition determined by the Zoning Administrator.



      (3)   Park Improvements Credit. The Village Board may
recognize existing or proposed park improvements as equal to or greater than
the value of the improvement fees required in this Section and may credit the
development's total required park contribution with the value of such site
improvements.



      (4)   Private Parks. At the sole discretion of the Village, up
to 25% of the total park land donation may be established in a private park,
provided that such land is determined to be of equivalent value and available
by right to all residents of the development.



6.   School Site Donation.



   a.   General Provisions.



      (1)   Conveyance of Land. Required land donations shall be
provided per the requirements of § 156.04.E.6 (Conveyance of Site).



      (2)   Cash Donations. Required cash donations shall be
provided per the requirements of § 156.04.E.9 (Cash Donations).



   b.   School Land Donation Calculation.



      (1)   School Classifications and Size of School Site. School
classifications and the size of school sites within the Village shall be
determined in accordance with the criteria shown in Table 156.04.E-D. School
Classifications and Size, which is consistent with the minimum site
recommendations of the Illinois Office of Education Standards, as adopted by
the Illinois State Board of Education.



      (2)   Land Donation Formula. The ultimate number of students
to be generated by a subdivision, planned development, or annexation shall
bear directly on the amount of land required for school sites. The following
formula determines how many acres are required to be donated:



         (a)   The total number of units for each dwelling type
to be built is multiplied by the corresponding population density in Table
156.04.E-B. Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit.



         (b)   Using the resulting projections for students, use
Table 156.04.E-D. School Classifications and Size to establish the ratio of
projected students to the required acreage for school sites of each school
classification.

   c.   Initial Improvements Fee. In addition to the land donation
requirement (or the cash contribution in lieu thereof), developments shall be
required to donate a sum of money for school site capital improvements costs.
In order to provide for the improvement of areas and facilities to serve the
residents of the dwelling units proposed, an initial improvements fee of
$1,000 per school age child (K-12) projected to be generated by the proposed
development is necessary.



7.   Reservation of Additional Land. Where the Comprehensive Plan, park
plan, or other Village or school district plan calls for a larger amount of
park land or school site in a particular development than the amounts
calculated by the requirements of this Section, the land needed beyond the
required donation shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the Village or
other public body designated by the Village, at the current FMV as determined
by the Village, provided that such acquisition, or an agreement for
acquisition, is made within one year of final approval. The failure of the
Village, school district or other public body to acquire, or reach an
agreement for acquisition, within one year of final approval shall cause
termination of the reservation and release said property for further
development in accordance with Village regulations.



8.   Conveyance of Land Donation.



   a.   Title. All land donations for park, school or other public
purpose shall be initially conveyed to the Village, within 30 days following
the recording of a final plat, planned development agreement or annexation
agreement, unless otherwise determined by the Village.



   b.   Conveyance Requirements. Each deed or other instrument
conveying land to the Village, school district, or other public body shall be
accompanied by:



      (1)   A written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed
to do business in Illinois to insure the Village's title to such real estate
in an amount equal to its value, subject only to then current general real
estate taxes, covenants, conditions and restrictions which do not prohibit
the use of the subject real estate for park or school use, utility easements
located within 20 feet of the boundary lines of the subject real estate, and
drainage ditches, feeders, laterals, and underground pipe or other conduit,
and acts done or suffered by or judgments against the Village.



      (2)   A current boundary line survey, certified to the Village
by a licensed Illinois Land Surveyor to be in compliance with the Illinois
Land Survey Standard.



      (3)   In instances where the real estate to be conveyed is a
lot in a recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition
in a form acceptable to the appropriate county authorities so that the land
to be conveyed can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number for
exemption purposes.



      (4)   An environmental audit, prepared by an environmental
consultant acceptable to the Village, assuring the Village that there are no
hazardous or toxic substances, wastes, materials or chemicals, as defined in
federal, state and local laws, ordinances or regulations, on the property.



   c.   Maintenance. Maintenance of the land reserved for school or
non-Village operated public purpose shall be the responsibility of the
intended ultimate user from the date that it is conveyed to the Village or
other public body until ownership is transferred or the property sold.
Failure of the intended ultimate user to maintain the land shall result in
the immediate relinquishing of all present and future rights to the property,
subject to statutory law governing conveyances of municipal real estate.



9.   Cash Donations.



   a.   Establishment of Fees.



      (1)   Determination of In-Lieu Fee Amounts. The cash
contribution in lieu of land shall be determined by multiplying the acreage
demand for a given development by the average fair market value for land
acquisition.



      (2)   Determination of Fair Market Value. The cash
contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of
subdivided land improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been
donated as park, recreation, or school sites. The average fair market value
for acquiring improved land in the Village is $115,000 per acre. The FMV
shall be adjusted upward at an annual rate of 3% effective January 1, 2019
and annually thereafter.



      (3)   Initial Improvement Fees. Required fees to improve park
and school facilities shall be paid as required by this Ordinance.



      (4)   Determination of Fees to Defray Increased Cost of
Services. The fee amount to defray the increased cost of a service shall be
set within this Ordinance and applied to the development on a per capita
basis.



   b.   Criteria for Requiring a Contribution in Lieu of Park or School
Sites.



      (1)   Unsuitability Determination. The determination that
available land is unsuitable for a park or school site shall be made by the
Village after inspection of the land by staff and receiving the
recommendation of the local school board and developer affected.



      (2)   Small or Otherwise Inappropriate Sites. In cases where a
development is small and the resulting site would not be practical or
appropriate for a school or park, the Village shall require the developer to
pay a cash contribution in lieu of land donation.



      (3)   All other fees-in-lieu permitted in this ordinance shall
be subject to their own requirements as specified elsewhere in this ordinance.



   c.   Donation of Both Land and Cash In Lieu of Land. There will be
situations when a combination of land and a cash contribution in lieu of land
are both necessary. These occasions will be determined by the Village at its
sole discretion and will generally occur when:



      (1)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed
as the location for a park or school site. That portion of the land within
the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be donated
as a site aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be
required for any additional land that is required to be donated.



      (2)   A part of the designated park or school site has already
been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development
to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by donation,
and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.



      (3)   When certain park or school sites will be donated, and
the balance of the required park or school site acreage would be too small or
otherwise unsuitable for park or school sites, then cash shall be contributed
in lieu of the balance of the required school or park site acreage.



   d.   Time and Manner of Payment. Payments covering fees in lieu and
initial improvement fees shall be paid at the time of final plat, planned
development, or annexation agreement approval, or calculated according to the
number of dwelling units in the development with a proportionate amount paid
at the time a building permit is issued for each unit. The amount of each
payment shall be determined by the Village at the time of approval of the
final subdivision plat, the final plan of a planned development, or the
building permit, as the case may be.



   e.   Acceptance and Distribution of Cash Donations to Special
Districts.



      (1)   Deposit and Distribution. The cash contributions to be
paid to defray the increased cost of a non-Village service shall be deposited
with the Village Treasurer and subsequently paid out upon written request by
the applicable district and approval of the Village, without interest. Said
funds shall be used by the applicable district in which said funds were
collected solely for new facility or facility upgrades, equipment purchases
or upgrades and those other operational purposes necessary to provide
adequate service provision within the corporate limits of the Village. The
district shall submit semi-annual reports which include a detailed accounting
of all expenditures using the Village cash contributions and the fund balance.



      (2)   Indemnification. By acceptance of land or cash, or both,
pursuant to the provisions hereof; the district shall indemnify the Village
against any loss, cost or expense, including reasonable attorney's fees,
arising out of; or on account of; any land or payments designated for said
district under the provisions of this Section. Prior to the actual transfer
of land or funds, the district shall make the foregoing indemnity to the
Village in writing.



      (3)   Reimbursement. By acceptance of land or cash, or both,
pursuant to the provisions hereof; the district shall reimburse the Village
for all costs and expenses it incurs in connection with obtaining the land or
cash required by this Section. Payment of said amount shall be made to the
Village within 30 days of the district's receipt of the land or cash as
provided herein, or the receipt of an invoice from the Village whichever
occurs later.



      (4)   Challenges to Ordinance. In the event of any claim,
demand, or litigation against the Village in connection with this Ordinance,
the district will be solely responsible for all costs, expenses, and
attorneys' fees incurred in defending, supporting or upholding the validity
of said Ordinance provided, however, that the district may retain counsel of
its choice and determine an appropriate course of action in connection with
any such claim, demand, or litigation. In no event, however, shall the
Village be responsible for any expenses or costs as the district assumes all
financial responsibility concerning any challenges or claims to the validity
of this Ordinance.



10.   Funds to Defray Administrative Facilities. In order to help the
Village defray the cost of providing administrative services for the new
development, a cash contribution in the amount of $250 per capita shall be
made to the Village, for each person generated, with population to be
computed in accordance with Table 156.04.E-B. Ultimate Population Per
Dwelling Unit and accepted in accordance with § 156.04.E.9.e (Acceptance and
Distribution of Cash Donations to Special Districts).



11.   Funds to Defray Fire Protection. In order to defray the cost of fire
protection as furnished by the appropriate fire protection district, a
contribution of $100 per capita shall be made to the Village for each person
generated. Population to be computed in accordance with Table 156.04.E-B.
Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit and accepted in accordance with §
156.04.E.9.e (Acceptance and Distribution of Cash Donations to Special
Districts).



12.   Funds to Defray Library Facilities. In order to defray the cost of
library facilities and services to serve the immediate and future needs of
the residents of a new development, a cash contribution of $100 shall be made



   for each person generated from the development. Population shall be
computed in accordance with Table 156.04.E-B. Ultimate Population Per
Dwelling Unit and accepted in accordance with § 156.04.E.9.e (Acceptance and
Distribution of Cash Donations to Special Districts).

§ 156.05.A  Purpose



The purpose of this Article is to establish the various zoning districts
applicable to the Village and to introduce the Zoning Map.



§ 156.05.B  Establishment of Zoning Districts



In order to carry out the purpose and intent of this Ordinance, the Village
is hereby divided into the following zoning districts.



1.   Residential Districts.



   a.   F: Farming and Rural Residential District. The F Farming and
Rural Residential District is established to accommodate farming activities,
uses, and structures, along with limited residential development.



   b.   R-1: Single Dwelling Unit District. The R-1 Single Dwelling
Unit District is established to accommodate residential development in a
manner consistent with the character of most existing single-unit dwelling
neighborhoods in the Village. Single-unit dwellings, along with limited civic
and institutional uses, are allowed.



   c.   R-2: Single Dwelling Unit District. The R-2 Single Dwelling
Unit District provides for neighborhoods primarily consisting of single-unit
dwellings and two-unit dwellings in locations within the Village. Townhouse
dwellings, limited civic uses, and institutional uses are also allowed.



   d.   R-3: Multiple Dwelling Unit District. The R-3 Multiple Dwelling
Unit District is established to accommodate a mix of housing types, such as
multiple-unit, townhouse, and two-unit dwellings, in the Village. Limited
civic and institutional uses are also allowed.



2.   Business Districts.



   a.   B-1: Gateway Business District. The B-1 Gateway Business
District is established to accommodate moderate-intensity mixed-use and
pedestrian-oriented development in a gateway business corridor to the
Village's Downtown. The B-l District allows a range of retail, service,
office, mixed-use, and institutional uses.



   b.   B-2: Community Business District. The B-2 Community Business
District is established to accommodate auto-oriented commercial development
that serves the Village and surrounding communities, while promoting
walkability and connectivity to adjacent residential areas. The B-2 District
allows larger scale commercial, office, mixed-use, and institutional uses.



3.   Village Center District. The VC Village Center District is
established to promote and maintain a compatible mixture of commercial,
office, cultural, institutional, governmental, and multi-unit residential
uses in a compact, pedestrian-oriented, traditional village center.



4.   Industrial District. The I Industrial District is established to
provide for general industrial development in limited areas of the Village.
The I District allows industrial uses, such as assembly, warehousing,
distribution of goods, and manufacturing, as well as limited institutional
and commercial uses.



5.   Floodplain Overlay District. The FO Floodplain Overlay District is
established to reduce the potential for property damage and hazards to life
caused by flooding in the Village's flood hazard areas. The regulations of
the FO District are intended to implement and ensure consistency with the
National Flood Insurance Program.



§ 156.05.C  Zoning Map



1.   Establishment of Zoning Map. The location and boundaries of the
districts established in § 156.05.B (Establishment of Zoning Districts) are
hereby established on the map designated as the Zoning Map of the Village of
South Elgin and referred to herein as "Zoning Map." The Zoning Map is adopted
by reference and declared to be part of this Ordinance.



   a.   Location of Map. The Zoning Map shall be kept for reference on
the Village's public website and in the offices of both the Village Clerk and
Zoning Administrator.



   b.   Zoning Map Amendments. All amendments to this Ordinance (refer
to § 156.03.C.6 (Zoning Text or Map Amendment)) that involve a change to the
district designation of a lot shall be recorded on the Village's official
Zoning Map.



2.   Interpretation of Boundary Lines. The boundaries of all zoning
districts shown on the Zoning Map shall be determined in accordance with the
following rules:



   a.   Right-of-Way Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines
coincide with streets, alleys, railroads, easements, or similar
rights-of-way, the centerline of the right-of-way shall be considered the
boundary line of the district.



   b.   Lot Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a
lot line, the lot line shall be considered the boundary line of the district.



   c.   Subdivided Lots. When a lot held in one ownership on the
effective date of this Ordinance is divided by a district boundary line, the
entire lot shall be construed to be within the more restrictive district.



   d.   Shore Line Boundaries. Boundaries indicated as following shore
lines shall be construed to follow such shore lines, and in the event of
change in the shore line shall be construed as moving with the actual shore
line; boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed
to follow such center lines.



§ 156.05.D  Use of Land and Buildings



1.   Number of Buildings on a Lot. No more than one principal building may
be located on a lot used for a single-unit or two-unit dwelling; an accessory
dwelling unit is not considered a principal building for purposes of this
regulation. For other uses, more than one principal building may be located
on a lot provided that each building complies with the applicable
requirements of Section 156.06 (Zoning District Regulations) as though it
were a principal building on an individual lot.



2.   Applicability of District Regulations.



   a.   Applicability of Use Regulations. No building, structure, or
land shall be used for any use other than a use allowed as either a permitted
or special use in the zoning district in which such building, structure, or
land is located. Buildings, structures, or land may also be used for a
temporary use or an accessory use in accordance with the requirements of §
156.07.D (Accessory Structures and Uses) and § 156.07.E (Temporary
Structures and Uses).



   b.   Applicability of Lot and Setback Regulations. No lot or setback
shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements of this
Ordinance. Lots or setbacks created after the effective date hereof shall
meet the minimum requirements established by this Ordinance. All setbacks
allocated to a building shall be located on the same lot as such building.



   c.   Applicability of Bulk and Height Regulations. All buildings and
structures erected after the effective date of this Ordinance shall meet the
bulk and height requirements for the zoning district in which the structure
is located. No existing structure shall be enlarged, altered, reconstructed,
or relocated in such a manner that conflicts with the requirements of the
zoning district in which the structure shall be located.



3.   Visibility Obstruction. Nothing shall be erected, placed, or allowed
to grow in a manner that will create a visibility obstruction for motorists,
bicyclists, or pedestrians. No building, structure, sign, or landscape
element shall exceed three feet in height within the sight triangle area
formed by 25 feet along the intersecting streets, measured along the curb
line, or edge of pavement where no curbs are present (see Figure 156.05.D-A.
Sight Triangle).

      a.   In all zoning districts, except the VC District, when
improved lots on a block frontage are developed at an established front yard
setback less than the setback required in the district in which the lot is
located, any new building may conform to the average front yard setback on
the improved lots on both sides of the lot in question, but in no case shall
the average front yard setback be less than 15 feet.



      b.   In all zoning districts, except the VC District, if a
corner lot subdivided and duly recorded prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance has insufficient width to provide the required side yard and corner
side yard and maintain buildable width of 30 feet, the corner side yard may
be reduced in width by the distance necessary to maintain a buildable yard
width of 30 feet, provided the corner side yard is not reduced less than 30%
of the width of the lot, but not less than 15 feet.

§ 156.06.G  Design Requirements for Commercial Districts



1.   Applicability. The design requirements in this Section apply to all
new construction and significant exterior renovation of existing structures
within the Village's B-1, B-2, and VC Districts, with the exception of
single-unit dwellings, two-unit dwellings, and townhouses. See § 156.06.H,
§ 156.06.I, and § 156.06.J for additional design requirements specific to
each commercial zoning district.



2.   Design Requirements.



   a.   Facade Design.



      (1)   Defined Base, Middle, and Top. Multi-story buildings
shall be designed with a distinct base, middle, and top. The ground story
(base) of the building shall be defined from the upper stories by an
expression line, which is a decorative, three-dimensional linear element
protruding or indented at least two inches from a building facade.



      (2)   Vertical Facade Articulation. Architectural or
structural elements shall be incorporated at intervals of no less than 35
feet to vertically divide large flat planes along all street-facing facades
in excess of 50 feet. Examples of such elements include color change, texture
change, material change, or wall articulation change, such as an offset,
pilaster, column, reveal, or vertical expression line, of no less than six
inches.



   b.   Building Details. Pedestrian-scale elements, such as decorative
lighting not more than nine feet in height, planters, and awnings, shall be
included in the facade on any building elevation fronting a public
right-of-way.



   c.   Roof Design. Green roof, white roof, and blue roof designs are
encouraged.



   d.   Materials.



      (1)   Ground Story Allowed Materials. The following materials
are allowed on the ground story facade: durable and natural materials, such
as stone, brick, stucco, metal, concrete, burnished concrete masonry units,
and non-reflective glass, unless otherwise limited by § 156.06.G.2.d.(2).
(Limitation on Materials).



      (2)   Limitation on Materials. The following materials may
only be utilized for trim or architectural details, and shall not exceed 20%
of the total facade area: utility brick, or metal siding, metal wall panels,
exposed aggregate (rough finish) concrete wall panels, exterior insulation
and finishing systems, fiberglass, plastic, untreated wood, non-burnished
concrete masonry units, and mirror glass. The painting of brick, limestone,
or other natural stone is prohibited; such materials shall retain their
natural colors.



      (3)   VC District Materials. In addition to the materials
standards of § 156.06.G.2.d.(l). (Ground Story Allowed Materials) and §
156.06.G.2.d.(2). (Limitation on Materials), any building facade visible from
a public right of way, excluding alleys, shall not be less than 70% brick or
limestone (excluding windows).



3.   Explanation of Table Requirements. The following information explains
the commercial design requirements established in Tables 156.06.H-A,
156.06.I-A, and 156.06.J-A. Refer to Figure 156.06.G-A. Design Requirements
and Figure 156.06.G-B. Design Requirements.



   a.   Minimum Street Frontage. Proportion of street frontage that
must be occupied by the principal building's front facade. The requirement in
each table establishes the minimum percentage of the front lot line that must
be occupied by the front facade of the principal building.



   b.   Parking Location. The yards in which an off-street parking lot
is allowed.



   c.   Minimum Transparency. The amount of transparency (highly
transparent, non-reflective glass) required as a percentage of the total area
of the street-facing ground story facades. Transparency improves the visual
interest of the physical environment and its aesthetic appeal. Tinting in
excess of 20% of the transparent area is not allowed. Single and two-unit
dwellings shall be exempt from this requirement.



   d.   Principal Entrance Location. The facade on which the principal
building entrance must be located.

§ 156.06.L  FO Floodplain Overlay District Requirements



1.   Purpose. The purpose of the FO Floodplain Overlay District is to
reduce the potential for property damage and hazards to life caused by
flooding. The regulations are intended to implement and ensure consistency
with the ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, 18(g) Rivers, Lakes, and Streams Act and the
National Flood Insurance Program. The intent of this overlay district is to:



   a.   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices
in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.



   b.   Minimize the occurrence of future blight areas in the
floodplain.



   c.   Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood
damage and result in conflicts between property owners.



   d.   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents by controlling development which, alone
or in combination with other development, will create additional burden to
pay the costs of rescue, relief, emergency preparedness measures, pumping,
and temporary dikes or levees in areas subject to flooding.



   e.   Comply with federal, state, and Kane County floodplain
management requirements.



2.   Administration. The Zoning Administrator shall administer the
requirements of this section per § 156.03.C.4 (Floodplain Development
Permit).



3.   Applicability.



   a.   Definition of Applicability. The requirements of the FO
Floodplain Overlay District shall apply to all areas of the 100-year
floodplain within the jurisdiction of the Village that are identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as flood areas at high risk of
flooding, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), as may be
revised by FEMA. The FIRMs are adopted by reference and declared to be part
of this Ordinance. The FIRMs are on file at the Village. The FO District
includes the following zones:



      (1)   Floodway. Those areas of the floodplain that are
designated as floodway on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted by §
156.06.L.3.a (Definition of Applicability).



      (2)   Flood Fringe. Those areas of the 100-year floodplain
that are located outside of the floodway on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
adopted by § 156.06.L.3.a (Definition of Applicability).



   b.   Platted Lots Within Floodplain. If a lot is located either
partially or totally within the 100-year floodplain, the requirements of the
FO District shall be applied to the entire lot.



   c.   Relationship to Other Regulations. The requirements of the FO
District do not abrogate, supersede, or limit the permitting requirements or
authority of the State as administered by IDNR-OWR for floodplains or the
requirements of the Kane County Stormwater Management Ordinance. However,
where the FO District imposes stricter rules, those stricter rules apply.
These standards also do not require that approvals or other letters of
exemption be obtained from IDNR-OWR in situations covered by the statewide
floodplain construction permitting program.



4.   General Requirements.



   a.   Base Flood Height Increases. No development shall be allowed in
floodplain areas which will:



      (1)   Obstruct flow by blocking the conveyance of floodwaters
by itself or with other development, increasing base flood height.



      (2)   Increase base flood height due to floodplain storage
area lost, which equals or exceeds one one-hundredth of a foot.



   b.   Required Setback. A minimum setback of 50 feet shall be
maintained from any waterbody or wetland, as measured from the shoreline, to
help prevent flooding and the natural process of erosion from threatening
structures and their foundations.



      (1)   No principal or accessory structures shall encroach
within the required setback area.



      (2)   Required setback areas shall be comprised of native
vegetation.



      (3)   Exceptions to the native vegetation requirement may be
allowed to facilitate water dependent activities, utility maintenance, or
recreational access such as beaches and boat launches, as determined
appropriate by the Zoning Administrator. Pedestrian or bicycle paths,
wayfinding and educational signs, or maintenance accessways for utilities may
be permitted to encroach within the required setback, with Floodplain
Development Permit approval (refer to § 156.03.C.4 (Floodplain Development
Permit)).



5.   Uses Allowed in Floodway. The following uses shall be permitted in
the designated floodway upon approval of a Floodplain Development Permit. Any
use not listed is prohibited.



   a.   Community garden.



   b.   Park.



   c.   Utility, not requiring structures.



   d.   Open Space.



   e.   Multi-modal path or trail.



6.   Development Standards in Flood Fringe. Development is allowed in the
Flood Fringe area upon approval of a Floodplain Development Permit (refer to
§ 156.03.C.4 (Floodplain Development Permit)), subject to all standards of
the underlying zoning district and the standards of this Section.



   a.   Uses Allowed in Flood Fringe. Any building, structure, or use
allowed as a permitted or special use in the underlying zoning district is
permitted in the Flood Fringe area, subject to compliance with the general
requirements (see § 156.06.L.4 (General Requirements)) and floodproofing
requirements (see § 156.06.L.6.b (Floodproofing Required)) of the FO
District, which shall control when more restrictive.



   b.   Floodproofing Required. Any building, structure, or use
constructed in the Flood Fringe area shall be designed to withstand flood
velocities, forces, and other factors associated with the base flood.
Floodproofing measures shall be designed to protect the structure or
development to the flood protection elevation and such measures shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect.



      (1)   All flood-proofing measures shall be designed to:



         (a)   Withstand floor pressures, depths, velocities,
uplift and impact forces, and other base flood factors.



         (b)   Protect structures to the flood protection
elevation.



         (c)   Anchor structures to foundations to resist
flotation and lateral movement.



         (d)   Ensure that structural walls and floors are
watertight to the flood protection elevation, and the interior remains
completely dry during flooding without human intervention.



         (e)   Place essential utilities above the flood
protection elevation.



      (2)   Examples of flood-proofing measures include the
following:



         (a)   Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and
shutters.



         (b)   Reinforcement of walls and floors to resist
rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or floating debris.



         (c)   Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce
seepage of water through walls.



         (d)   Addition of mass or weight to structures to
prevent flotation.



         (e)   Installation of pumping facilities and/or
subsurface drainage systems to relieve foundation wall and basement floor
pressures and to lower water levels in structures.



         (f)   Construction of water supply wells and waste
treatment systems to prevent the entry of flood waters.



         (g)   Installation of cutoff valves on sewer lines or
the elimination of gravity basement drains.



§ 156.06.M  Principal Structure Encroachments



1.   Applicability. The following standards for principal structure
encroachments apply to all zoning districts.



2.   Principal Structure Encroachments. Table 156.06.M-A. Permitted
Principal Structure Encroachments establishes the components of a principal

      (2)   Screening and buffers must be provided along all public
roads adjacent to a mining operation as specified by the Village Board upon
approval of a special use permit. Existing trees and groundcover along the
public right-of-way adjoining the property must be preserved and maintained
for screening purposes to the greatest extent possible.



      (3)   No more than one entrance and one exit from a road may
be provided to the mining operation unless otherwise specified by the Village
Board. Such entrance must be located to avoid routing trucks to and from the
mining operation using residential streets. The mining operation shall
provide a paved road from the entrance and exit of the area of operation a
minimum of 300 feet from the public right-of-way in order to minimize
accumulating dirt and gravel on the public right-of-way. Entrances and exits
to the mining operation must be provided with gates that may be securely
locked.



      (4)   Trucks used to haul materials to and from the mining
operation must be loaded to prevent spillage onto the public right-of-way.
Any spillage on the public right-of-way from overloading or from material
adhering to truck tires must be removed periodically at the expense of the
operator.



      (5)   Overburden must not be removed in excess of the area
that is expected to be mined within one year following its removal.



      (6)   As specified by the approved reclamation plan,
development toward reclamation must progress as areas of the property are
mined, unless the reclamation of such areas would prevent the conduct of
mining operations on the remaining property. Groundcover or other planting
indicated on the approved reclamation plan must be installed in areas where
excavation is complete and before further overburden is removed in order to
ensure development as operations proceed.



      (7)   Weeds and other unsightly or noxious vegetation visible
from the public right-of-way must be maintained as necessary.



      (8)   Graded or backfilled areas must be covered with topsoil
to a minimum of six inches and seeded with appropriate ground cover. Such
topsoil must have a minimum of 25% organic material except that no greater
depth of topsoil or percentage of organic material is required than
originally existing on the property prior to the commencement of mining
operations.



   b.   Hours of Operation.



      (1)   Mining operations may be conducted from 6:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday,
except during an emergency situation or as specified by the Village Board.



      (2)   The sale and loading of previously stockpiled products
may be conducted from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday and from 9:00 a.m.

      (3)   Mining operations and the sale and loading of previously
stockpiled products cannot be conducted on holidays or Sundays except as
specified above.



   c.   Setback Requirement. Production, processing, and excavation
associated with a mining operation must be set back from the boundary of any
adjacent property that is not covered by a mining lease by a minimum often
feet plus one and one-half times the depth of the intended excavation, unless
otherwise specified by the Village Board.



   d.   Explosives. No explosives may be used or stored upon the
property of a mining operation or elsewhere in the Village in connection with
a mining operation unless such use is expressly authorized by the Village
Board or as part of an annexation agreement. If the use of explosives is
authorized in connection with the conduct of mining operations, the following
regulations apply.



      (1)   The use, handling, and storage of explosives shall
comply with the Illinois Explosives Act (ILCS Ch. 225, Act 210, §§ 1-1001
et seq.) and with all other applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, and
regulations.



      (2)   Explosives may be detonated from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Monday through Friday and from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Saturday unless
otherwise specified by the Village Board.



      (3)   Blast vibrations are permitted in accordance with
Appendix B of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines Report of
Investigations/1980 RI 8507 or any subsequent updated version.

limited and controlled as set forth in paragraph 816.65(e)(1) of the
Permanent Regulatory Program Implementing 501(b) of the Surface Mining
Control Reclamation Act of 1977, U.S. Department of the Interior, as amended.



      (5)   Mining operations that use explosives are required to
have a seismograph to determine ground disturbance with the following minimum
capabilities.



         (a)   The ability to respond to particle velocity in
each of the three mutually perpendicular planes.



         (b)   The ability to record velocity time histories in
each of the three mutually perpendicular planes.



         (c)   The ability to record an airblast time history.



         (d)   A seismic frequency response of 2.0 to 200 Hz +/-
3dB.



         (e)   A particle velocity dynamic range of 0.02 to 4.0
ips.



         (f)   A sound measuring range of 110 to 140dB.

flat response.



   e.   Ready Mix Plants. Plants for making ready mixed concrete using
aggregate taken from a mining operation are allowed with a separate special
use permit application that may be combined with the application for a
special use permit to conduct a mining operation. All mixing equipment,
buildings, and structures associated with a ready mix plant operation must be
removed from a site upon the cessation of operations or the expiration of the
special use permit.



   f.   Expiration of Special Use Permit. A special use permit issued
for a mining operation is valid for ten years from the date of approval by
the Village Board unless otherwise specified by the Village Board or an
annexation agreement. The renewal of a special use permit must be approved by
the Village Board and cannot exceed a period often years. All renewals are
subject to the same conditions as the original special use permit, as well as
any new conditions required by the Village Board.



   g.   Assignment. Authorization to conduct a mining operation may not
be assigned or transferred at any time without the written consent of the
Village Board unless otherwise specified by the Village Board or an

the prior written approval of the Zoning Administrator.



      (2)   Recycled Materials. When asphalt paving is utilized for
off-street parking lots, the asphalt mixture must contain a minimum of 20%
recycled materials. Parking areas that serve single-unit, two-unit, and
townhouse dwellings are exempt from this requirement.



   e.   Location. In the B-1, B-2, VC, and I Districts, parking areas
shall only be permitted in the allowable yards stated in each district's
design requirements (see Section 156.06 (Zoning District Regulations)).



   f.   Encroachment. Parking lots are allowed to encroach into the
required interior side and/or rear yard, but shall be at least one foot from
any lot line in the VC District, and at least five feet from any lot line in
the B-1 District, provided no parking lot perimeter landscape (see §
156.09.E.3 (Parking Lot Perimeter Landscape)) or buffer yard (see § 156.09.F
(Buffer Yards)) is required.



   g.   Maintenance Responsibility. All parking and loading areas shall
be maintained and kept in good repair by the property owner.



§ 156.08.B  Required Off-Street Parking Spaces



1.   General Requirements. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in
accordance with the following standards.



   a.   Availability of Spaces. All parking spaces approved as part of
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be made available to the
residents, customers, employees, guests, and/or other users of the principal
use. Spaces shall not be utilized for motor vehicle repair, service, or sale,
or for long-term storage or display of vehicles, materials, or goods.



   b.   Accessible Parking.



      (1)   State Requirements. Accessible parking spaces shall be
designed and provided as required by the Illinois Accessibility Code, as
amended from time to time, and all additional applicable laws.



      (2)   Applicability. Accessible parking shall be provided for
all off-street parking lots that provide parking for employees, visitors, or
both, with the exception of single-unit and two-unit dwellings.



      (3)   Minimum Parking Requirements. The number of accessible
parking spaces may be counted toward the total number of off-street parking
spaces required.



      (4)   Other Laws and Regulations. In the event of a conflict
between this Section and any applicable state law or regulation, the
provision requiring the greatest number of accessible parking spaces shall
control.



   c.   Off-Premises Parking Facilities. Parking facilities for uses
other than single-unit, two-unit, and townhouse dwellings may be provided
off-premises with prior written Zoning Administrator approval, provided that
the following conditions are met:



      (1)   Location.



         (a)   Residential Uses. Any off-premises parking
facility for a residential use must be located within 400 feet, along a
pedestrian route, of the nearest principal entrance for which the parking is
required.



         (b)   Nonresidential Uses. Any off-premises parking
facility for a non-residential use must be located within 800 feet, along a
pedestrian route, of the nearest principal entrance of the building for which
the parking is required.



      (2)   Parking Agreement. A written agreement for off-premise
parking facilities shall be executed between the landowner and the lessee in
a form satisfactory to the Village Attorney and shall be recorded in the
Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Kane County, as applicable. The agreement
shall include:



         (a)   A guarantee between the landowner and lessee for
access to and use of the parking facility.



         (b)   A guarantee that the off-street parking spaces
will be provided, maintained, and reserved for the uses served for as long as
such uses are in operation.



   d.   Maximum Number of Parking Spaces. No use shall provide parking
spaces in excess of 125% of the required minimum parking amount shown in
Table 156.08.B-A. Off-Street Parking Requirements, with the following
exceptions:



      (1)   In residential districts, maximum off-street parking
requirements shall not apply to residential uses.



      (2)   Any use required to provide less than ten parking spaces
may exceed the maximum allowable amount, but may not provide more than 15
spaces.



      (3)   With Zoning Administrator approval, the maximum parking
amount may be exceeded by up to 50 percentage points, for a total of 175%,
provided that:



         (a)   The area exceeding the maximum parking requirement
is constructed with pervious paving materials.



         (b)   The ten-year, 24-hour storm event, as calculated
for the portion of the lot exceeding the maximum parking requirement, is
retained on-site utilizing green infrastructure techniques, such as rain
gardens and bioretention facilities.



   e.   Tandem Parking. Tandem parking may be granted by the Zoning
Administrator through an application for Minor Site Plan Review (see §
156.03.C.2.b.(2) (Minor Site Plan Review)). Tandem parking is permitted for
residential uses only and both parking spaces must be allotted to the same
dwelling unit and located on the same lot as the dwelling unit.



2.   Computation. Off-street parking spaces shall be calculated using the
following standards.



   a.   Units of Measurement. The following shall be utilized to
calculate the number of required parking spaces.



      (1)   Gross Floor Area. Unless otherwise stated, parking
standards for non-residential uses shall be calculated on the basis of gross
floor area (GFA) in square feet.



      (2)   Occupancy- or Capacity-Based Requirements. Parking
spaces required per seat, employee, student, or occupant shall be calculated
based on the maximum number of employees on the largest shift, or maximum
fire-rated capacity of the building, whichever measurement is applicable.



   b.   Fractions of Parking Spaces. When computation of required
parking spaces results in a fraction, any fraction of less than one-half
shall be disregarded, and any fraction of one-half or more shall be counted
as one parking space.



   c.   Multiple Uses on a Lot. When there are multiple uses on a lot,
the amount of parking spaces required shall be the sum of the parking
requirements for each individual use.



   d.   Use of Off-Street Loading Area. Area allocated to any
off-street loading spaces shall not be used to satisfy parking space
requirements.



   e.   Parking Reductions and Shared Parking. The amount of parking
required for a use may be reduced if the use qualifies for a parking
reduction as established in § 156.08.C (Parking Reductions) or shared
parking as established in § 156.08.D (Shared Parking).



3.   Off-Street Parking Requirements. Table 156.08.B-A. Off-Street Parking
Requirements establishes the minimum vehicular parking requirements for the
listed uses. Any use not specified in Table 156.08.B-A. Off-Street Parking
Requirements shall adhere to the requirements provided for the most similar
use as determined by the Zoning Administrator.

§ 156.08.C  Parking Reductions



1.   Parking Reductions. The off-street parking requirements established
in Table 156.08.B-A. Off-Street Parking Requirements may be reduced by the
following measures, as applicable.



   a.   VC District Exemption. The requirements of Table 156.08.B-A.
Off-Street Parking Requirements shall not apply to non-residential uses in
the VC District.



   b.   Proximity to a Bus Stop. Nonresidential uses that are located
within 500 feet of a public transit bus stop with regular, scheduled service,
as measured from any point along the lot line, may reduce the total number of
off-street parking spaces required by 5%.



   c.   Proximity to a Municipal Parking Lot. Nonresidential uses that
are located within 500 feet of a municipally-owned parking lot, as measured
from any point along the lot line, may reduce the total number of off-street
parking spaces required by 25%.



   d.   Fee-In-Lieu. A fee-in-lieu of providing parking spaces may be
permitted by the Zoning Administrator. The fee required shall be based upon a
uniform fee per parking space established annually by the Village Board. Such
payment shall be placed into a fund to be used by the Village for the
acquisition, construction, and maintenance of public off-street parking lots
within the same zoning district as the subject use or within adjacent zoning
districts of reasonable proximity to serve the subject use. The property
granted the reduction in the number of required off-street spaces shall be
credited permanently by ordinance with the number of spaces for which payment
was received by the Village.



   e.   Electric Vehicle Charging Station. Each parking space used as
an electric vehicle charging station may be counted as three off-street
parking spaces, provided that the space is reserved exclusively for electric
vehicle charging purposes, for a credit of up to 10% of the total number of
required off-street spaces.



   f.   Car-Share. Multi-unit dwellings that provide car-share parking
spaces may reduce the total number of required parking spaces by five parking
spaces for each car-share parking space provided. The applicant shall provide
documentation of an agreement with a car-share company in a format approved
by the Village Attorney. If this agreement should terminate at any point,
then the applicant shall either arrange a new agreement with a car-share
company to avoid service interruption, or meet the minimum parking
requirements established by this Section.



   g.   Long-Term Bicycle Parking. Each four long-term bicycle parking
spaces provided in accordance with § 156.08.E.4.b (Long-Term Bicycle
Parking) may be credited as one motor vehicle space, for a credit of up to
20% of the total number of required off-street spaces.



§ 156.08.D  Shared Parking



1.   Applicability. For multiple uses that share a parking lot, a
reduction of the total required off-street parking spaces may be granted by
the Zoning Administrator through an application for Minor Site Plan Review
(see § 156.03.C.2.b.(2) (Minor Site Plan Review)).



2.   General Requirements. The following requirements apply to all shared
parking agreements.



   a.   Any change in ownership or use of a lot shall cause the
applicant or property owner to meet the minimum parking requirements
established by this Section, or arrange a new shared parking agreement. In
the event that a change in ownership or use should occur, the applicant or
property owner must provide written notification to the Zoning Administrator.
Within 60 days of that notice, the applicant shall provide a satisfactory
resolution to the Zoning Administrator that provides adequate parking or the
condition will be considered a zoning violation.



   b.   Shared parking may be located off-site provided it complies
with the location requirements of § 156.08.B.1.c.(1) (Off-Premises Parking
Facilities).



3.   Shared Parking Among Lots Under Different Ownership. When a shared
parking reduction is applied to uses on lots under different ownership, the
following shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator:



   a.   A site plan that provides for interconnected lots.



   b.   Recorded easements that provide:



      (1)   Cross-access among the parking areas to permit
pedestrian access and off-street parking by the different uses in the
connected properties.



      (2)   Allocation of maintenance responsibilities.



      (3)   A pedestrian circulation system that connects uses and
parking areas.



4.   Calculation. Shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of
required parking spaces in situations where a parcel is occupied by two or
more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same
time. When any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed
in Table 156.08.D-A. Shared Parking Calculation, the minimum total number of
required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedure:



   a.   Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use
by the appropriate percentage listed in Table 156.08.D-A. Shared Parking
Calculation for each of the designated time periods.



   b.   Calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five time periods
in each column. The minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums.

5.   Special Shared Parking Study. As an alternative to the methodology
established in § 156.08.D.4 (Calculation), an applicant may submit a special
shared parking study to the Zoning Administrator to demonstrate that the
parking demand for multiple uses is less than the cumulative parking
requirements for each individual use. The special shared parking study shall
be conducted by a qualified professional at the applicant's expense.



§ 156.08.E  Required Bicycle Parking



1.   Applicability. Minimum bicycle parking requirements shall apply to
the specified categories of land use set forth in Table 156.08.E-A. Bicycle
Parking Requirements, provided that those use categories meet the development
thresholds listed in § 156.08.A.2 (Applicability). If no requirement is
listed in Table 156.08.E-A. Bicycle Parking Requirements for a particular
use, no bicycle parking is required.



2.   Computation. When the bicycle parking requirement is based on the
number of dwelling units, the total number of bicycle spaces required shall
be based on the total number of dwelling units in the development.



3.   Minimum Requirement. Where bicycle parking is required, a minimum of
two spaces shall be provided.



4.   Bicycle Parking Design. Bicycle parking spaces shall be designed in
accordance with the following requirements:



   a.   General Design Standards. The following standards apply to all
long-term and short-term bicycle parking spaces, see Figure 156.08.E-A.
Bicycle Parking Design.



      (1)   Dimensions. Each bicycle parking space shall have a
minimum width of two feet, minimum length of six feet, and minimum vertical
clearance of seven feet.



      (2)   Access. An aisle with a minimum width of five feet, such
as a sidewalk or shared path, shall be provided adjacent to bicycle parking
facilities to ensure adequate maneuvering space.



      (3)   Racks and Structures. Secure racks and supporting
structures shall be provided for each bicycle parking space, and shall be
designed to accommodate both chain and U-shaped locking devices.



      (4)   Visibility and Maintenance. Areas used for bicycle
parking shall be designed and maintained to be well-lit and reasonably free
from standing water, mud, and dust.



      (5)   Signage. If required bicycle parking spaces for
non-residential uses are not visible from the street, signage shall be posted
indicating the location of such parking.



   b.   Long-Term Bicycle Parking. Long-term bicycle parking is not
required, but as a means of encouraging the provision of long-term bicycle
parking spaces for employees and bicycle commuters, motor vehicle parking
credit is offered in accordance with § 156.08.C.1 (Long-Term Bicycle
Parking).



      (1)   Location. Long-term bicycle parking shall be located
within an enclosed, limited-access area designed to protect bicycles from
inclement weather, unauthorized use, and theft, and shall adhere to the
following:



         (a)   Long-term bicycle parking shall be provided within
the building containing the use that it is intended to serve, or within a
structure that has a principal entrance no more than 200 feet from the
principal entrance to such building.



         (b)   Long-term bicycle parking serving multiple uses or
buildings may be combined into a single area, enclosure, or facility.



         (c)   Where long-term bicycle parking is located
adjacent to vehicular parking or loading facilities, a physical barrier shall
be provided to prevent damage to bicycles by motor vehicles.



      (2)   Facilities. Long-term bicycle parking spaces may be
provided within the following types of facilities:



         (a)   Enclosed spaces within a building, such as bicycle
rooms or garages.



         (b)   Bicycle sheds.



         (c)   Bicycle lockers or fixed-in-place containers.



         (d)   Other enclosed spaces that are monitored at all
times by an attendant or other security system.



   c.   Short-Term Bicycle Parking. The following standards apply to
required short-term bicycle parking spaces, as established in Table
156.08.E-A. Bicycle Parking Requirements.



      (1)   Location. Short-term bicycle parking shall be located in
a highly visible, publicly-accessible space within 50 feet of the principal
entrance to a building containing the use it serves. For buildings or uses
requiring more than eight short-term bicycle parking spaces, some of the
required spaces may be located at a greater distance from the entrances,
provided that eight short-term spaces are located within 50 feet of any
principal entrance.



      (2)   Facilities. Short-term bicycle parking spaces shall
permit the locking of the bicycle frame and one wheel to the rack, and shall
support a bicycle in a stable position without damage to the wheels, frame,
or components.



      (3)   Safe Access. Parking areas shall be located to permit
safe travel to and from the use served, easily accessible from the street or
bike path, and protected from motor vehicles.



      (4)   Spaces Within Right-Of-Way. With the permission of the
Village Engineer, the property owner may install the required short-term
bicycle parking spaces within in the public right-of-way.



      (5)   Credit for Existing Public Parking Facilities. Existing
public bicycle parking spaces located in the right-of-way or on Village
property may contribute to compliance with required short-term bicycle
parking when located adjacent to the applicable use.



      (6)   Fee-In-Lieu. A fee-in-lieu of providing short-term
bicycle parking spaces may be permitted with written approval of the Zoning
Administrator. The fee required shall be based upon a uniform fee per
short-term bicycle space established annually by the Village Board. Such
payment shall be placed into a fund to be used by the Village for the
acquisition, construction, and maintenance of short-term bicycle parking
located in the public right-of-way or Village owned property within the same
zoning district as the subject use or within adjacent zoning districts of
reasonable proximity to serve the subject use. The property granted the
reduction in the number of required short-term bicycle parking spaces shall

§ 156.08.G  Pedestrian Circulation Standards



1.   Purpose. The pedestrian standards of this section are intended to
promote a safe, convenient, and comfortable network of pedestrian walkways to
avoid conflict between pedestrians and traffic. The design and installation
of pedestrian circulation systems to provide safety and connection is a
matter of Village-wide concern and shall be provided as set forth in the
following standards.



2.   Applicability. The pedestrian circulation standards of this section
apply to all projects requiring major site plan review (refer to §
156.03.C.2 (Site Plan Review) or seeking Planned Development approval (refer
to § 156.03.D (Planned Developments)).



3.   General Requirements.



   a.   Public Sidewalks. The Village is authorized to require the
installation of public sidewalks subject to the applicability of this
Section, for any platted lot where sidewalks have not been constructed.



   b.   Frontage Sidewalk. A sidewalk, with a minimum width of seven
feet, shall be required along the full length of any building frontage
containing a primary entrance that is directly abutted by a parking row,
driveway, or drive aisle. Refer to Figure 156.08.G-A. Frontage Sidewalk.



Figure 156.08.G-A. Frontage Sidewalk







 



   c.   On-Site Pedestrian Circulation. In conjunction with any planned
development or application for major site plan review, an on-site pedestrian
circulation system must be provided in accordance with the following
requirements (Refer to Figure 156.08.G-B. On-Site Pedestrian Circulation):



      (1)   Connection to the Street. The on-site pedestrian
circulation system must connect all adjacent public rights-of-way to the main
building entrance. The connection must follow a direct route and not involve
significant out-of-direction travel for system users.



      (2)   Connection to Adjacent Areas. The on-site pedestrian
circulation system must provide at least one connection to all adjacent
properties. Connections must provide access to existing paths or sidewalks on
adjacent properties or to the likely future location of paths or sidewalks on
those properties. Upon the determination of the Zoning Administrator that no
path or sidewalk exists on a neighboring property or that the likely location
of future path or sidewalk connections cannot be determined, and that
extending a connection would create a safety hazard on either property, no
connection is required.



      (3)   Internal Connections. The on-site pedestrian circulation
system must connect all buildings on the site and provide connections to
other site areas likely to be used by pedestrians, such as parking areas,
bicycle parking, recreational areas, and common outdoor areas.



Figure 156.08.G-B. On-Site Pedestrian Circulation

circulation facilities must be designed and constructed in accordance with
the following requirements:



      (1)   The on-site pedestrian circulation system must be paved,
with a minimum width of five feet.



      (2)   Where the on-site pedestrian circulation system crosses
driveways, drive aisles, or loading areas, it must be clearly marked through
grade differences, a change in materials, special pavers, or stamped asphalt
or concrete. Painted striping shall not meet this requirement.



      (3)   Where a pedestrian walkway is parallel and adjacent to a
driveway or drive aisle, it must be a raised path at least six inches above
the auto travel lane surface and separated from the auto travel lane by a
raised curb, and may also include intervening landscaping, decorative
bollards, or other architectural features.



      (4)   Pedestrian circulation systems should be integrated with
required parking lot landscaping in accordance with § 156.09.E (Parking Lot
Landscaping) where appropriate.



§ 156.08.H  Loading Facility Requirements



1.   Applicability. Commercial, civic, institutional, industrial, and
multi-unit dwelling uses shall provide off-street loading spaces as
established in Table 156.08.H-A. Loading Requirements. The Zoning
Administrator may approve a reduction in the minimum loading requirements, or
approval for shared use of loading spaces for multiple users, through an
application for Minor Site Plan Review (see § 156.03.A.2.b.(2) (Minor Site
Plan Review)).



2.   Computation. Off-street loading spaces shall be calculated on the
basis of gross floor area (GFA) in square feet.



   a.   Fractions of Loading Spaces. When computation of required
loading spaces results in a fraction, any fraction of less than one-half
shall be disregarded, and any fraction of one-half or more shall be counted
as one loading space.



   b.   Maximum Number of Loading Spaces. The maximum number of loading
spaces required for any property shall be four spaces.



3.   Dimensions. All required loading spaces shall have a minimum width of
ten feet, minimum length of 65 feet, and minimum vertical clearance of 14
feet.



4.   Location. All loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the
use served, unless an alternate location has been approved by the Zoning
Administrator through the site plan review process (see § 156.03.A.2 (Site
Plan Review)).



   a.   Side or Rear yard. Loading facilities shall be located on the
side and/or rear yard of the lot. A designated loading area may be located
within a drive aisle with prior written approval from the Zoning
Administrator.



   b.   Residential Districts. No loading space shall be closer than 50
feet to any property in a residential district, unless the space is screened
by a solid fence or wall with a minimum height of six feet.



5.   Access. Each required off-street loading space shall have appropriate
means of vehicular access from a driveway, street or alley in a manner that
minimizes interference with traffic movement. No loading space shall project
into or block a street, alley, access drive, or parking area. Loading
facilities must be designed to allow the driver to proceed forward into
traffic, rather than back out.

§ 156.10. A  Purpose



1.    Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish regulations to
govern the display, design, construction, installation, maintenance, and
removal of signs. The regulations in this Section shall:



   a.   Promote and protect the health, safety, and general welfare of
the Village from signs that are unsafe, conflict with traffic control

   f.   Discourage signs that are unsightly, inappropriate, or
excessive in area or number.



§ 156.10.B  General Construction and Design Standards



1.   General Requirements. All signs shall meet the construction and
design standards of this Article and of Chapter 150 (Building Regulations).



2.   Installation. All signs shall be installed so that necessary supports
and braces are an integral part of the sign design.



3.   Location. All signs shall comply with the following standards.



   a.   Public Property. Signs may only be placed on public property by
a government agency or as authorized by this Section. Any sign placed on
public property without authorization may be removed without notice.



   b.   Private Property. Signs may only be placed on private property
with prior consent of the property owner and, if applicable, pursuant to an
approved minor site plan review issued by the Zoning Administrator.



   c.   Building Exterior. A sign mounted on the exterior of a building
shall not conceal any windows, doors, or unique architectural features. This
standard does not apply to window signs.



   d.   Visibility Obstruction. Minimum clear sight distance at all
intersections shall be in accordance with §156.05.D.3 (Visibility
Obstruction) and other applicable guidelines, whichever is greater.



   e.   Special Areas of Control. The Village Board may designate
geographic areas within the Village as a special area of control for purposes
of these regulations. A special area of control is an area in which special
standards are drafted in order to incorporate a wider variety of sign design,
or to address unique communication needs.



      (1)   The Village designates park lands within the Village of
South Elgin as Special Areas of Control. Any organization that has executed a
formal contract with the Village concerning the use of park land and that has
a published set of by-laws, rules or regulations governing sponsorship
relationships that is consistent with Village ordinances and policies, may
apply for a sponsorship sign permit to permit that organization to affix
signage advertising the businesses and other sponsors of the organization.
The application for sponsorship sign permits shall be reviewed by the
Village. After review and comment by the Village, the proposed signage
program shall be subject to approval by the Village Board.



      (2)   Nothing contained herein shall constitute a declaration
by the Village that park lands are now a public forum nor shall anything
contained herein constitute a waiver of any time, place and manner
restrictions on assemblies or speech in Village parks.



4.   Illumination. All signs shall comply with the following illumination
standards.



   a.   Electrical Components. All electrical components used in the
construction of a sign shall be installed and maintained as required by
Chapter 150 (Building Regulations).



   b.   Light Level.



      (1)   LED Lighting. The light level of an illuminated sign lit
with LED bulbs shall be no greater than 5,000 nits of luminance from dawn to
dusk, and no greater than 150 nits of luminance from dusk to dawn.



      (2)   Non-LED Lighting. The light level of an illuminated sign
lit with bulbs other than LED bulbs shall be no greater than one foot-candle
at any time of day as measured at the curb line.



   c.   Direct Light and Glare. All sign illumination shall be located,
shielded, and directed to illuminate only the sign face and to prevent direct
light or glare from being cast upon adjacent rights-of-way and surrounding
properties. No sign illumination may be combined with reflective materials,
such as mirrors, polished metal, or highly-glazed tiles, which would increase
glare.



   d.   External Illumination. Externally illuminated signs shall be
illuminated by steady, stationary, fully shielded light sources concentrated
on the face of the sign so as not to cause glare.



   e.   Neon Signs. Marquee signs may be illuminated with neon. Window
signs that are illuminated with neon are allowed in accordance with the
standards of § 156.10.D.2.h (Window Signs).



   f.   Hours of Operation. Illuminated signs shall be turned off from
11:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m., or 30 minutes after close of business, whichever
is later. Uses that remain in operation between 11:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.
are exempt from this requirement during the period of operation only.



5.   Message Substitution. Any sign may contain, in lieu of any other
message or copy, any lawful noncommercial message, so long as the sign
complies with the size, height, area, location, and other requirements of
this Section.



6.   Maintenance, Inspection, and Removal.



   a.   Maintenance. All signs, support structures, and the area
immediately adjacent to signs shall be regularly maintained, including
cleaning, repainting, and repairs. No sign may be constructed, erected, or
maintained in a manner that is unsafe, insecure, or a danger to the public.



   b.   Inspection. The Village may inspect any sign regulated by this
Section at any time to determine whether the sign is in need of repair or
removal, or whether it is in conformance with the provisions of this Section.



   c.   Removal of Unsafe Signs. Any sign that is an immediate peril to
persons or property may be removed by the Village without prior notice to the
owner thereof. The cost of removal will be billed to the property owner.



   d.   Removal of Obsolete Signs. Any permitted sign may remain in
place after a corresponding commercial use has vacated the subject premises,
provided the sign is left non-illuminated and sign copy is removed within 30
days after the use vacates the premises. If a new on-site use for the sign
has not commenced within six months of the previous use vacating the
premises, the sign shall be deemed abandoned, and is subject to the
provisions of § 156.11.D.6 (Discontinuation or Abandonment of Nonconforming
Signs).



§ 156.10.C  Sign Measurement Standards

Measurement and Figure 156.10.C-B. Measurement for Signs with Multiple Faces.



   a.   Signs with Backgrounds. For signs mounted upon a background,
sign area is measured as the entire area of the sign face or background of
the sign used to distinguish the sign from the structure upon which it is
placed, unless otherwise noted in this Section. Sign area does not include
any supporting framework or bracing, unless such framework or bracing is part
of the message or sign face.



   b.   Signs with Freestanding Letters and/or Logos. For signs
consisting of freestanding letters and/or logos, sign area is measured as the
total area of the smallest geometric shapes that will enclose each word and
graphic in the display. Sign area does not include any supporting framework
or bracing, unless the framework or bracing is part of the message or sign
face.



   c.   Signs with Multiple Faces. For signs with multiple faces, if
the interior angle between the sign faces is 45 degrees or less, sign area is
the area of one sign face. If the angle between the sign faces is greater
than 45 degrees, sign area is the sum of the areas of the sign faces. Sign
area does not include any supporting framework or bracing, unless such
framework or bracing is part of the message or sign face.
