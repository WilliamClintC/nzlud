In determining what is a reasonable time, the City may consider the estimate of local professionals including licensed contractors. (Ord. 99-27, eff. 12/21/99)

The officer or employee shall have the authority to issue an administrative citation to the responsible party upon the basis of this affidavit, but the officer or employee will have the discretion not to issue the administrative citation if, based on a totality of the facts and circumstances, the officer or employee does not believe that a violation of this Code actually occurred or could be proven to have occurred at an administrative hearing.

The screening process will be based upon the application, any supplemental application/questionnaire and other information received which clearly demonstrates the most appropriate breadth and depth of job-related training, experience, and education for the position. Applicants not meeting the minimum qualifications for the vacant position will be screened-out, and only a limited number of the most suited applicants will be selected to further participate in the examination process.

Examinations shall consist of selection techniques which will test fairly the qualifications of candidates such as: personal interview, written examination, performance tests, work samples, physical agility tests, evaluation of training and experience, psychological tests, background investigation, or any combination of these or other tests.

(1)  Open Examinations: Examinations may be administered periodically for a single class as needed and approved by the City Manager. Names shall be placed on eligibility lists, and shall remain on such lists, as prescribed in these chapters.

(2)  Promotional Examinations: Promotional examinations may be conducted whenever, in the opinion of the City Manager and the department director, it appears that it may meet the needs of the selection process. Promotional examinations may include any of the selection techniques mentioned in this chapter, or any combination of them. City employees who have full-time, probationary, part-time, or limited-service status, entered City service through a competitive process, and meet the requirements set forth in the promotional examination announcement may apply and compete in promotional examinations.

(b)  Conduct of Examination: The City may contract with any competent agency or individual for the preparing and/or administering of examinations. Selection material shall be prepared under the direction of the City Manager. The City Manager may use examinations prepared by the contracted agencies or individuals when deemed appropriate. Qualified employees may assist as subject matter experts in the development and administration of the selection process if requested by the City Manager.

(c)   Oral Board: Oral boards will be generally composed of members of the workforce at large and subject matter experts. Whenever possible, the oral board will include a member of a protected group, to reflect the composition of the applicants being interviewed. Non-technical, community interest representatives will be considered for the board when possible. The City Manager, or if the recruitment is for a part-time or limited-service position, the department director, shall have the responsibility for ensuring oral board diversity. Prior to the interview, the oral board members shall be provided an orientation to assure that questions are consistent, relevant, non-discriminatory and provide an equal opportunity for applicants to present their qualifications.

(d)  Scoring Examination and Qualifying Scores: A candidate’s score in a given examination shall be the total of his scores on each competitive part of the examination, weighted as determined for the selection process. Failure in one part of the examination may be grounds for declaring such applicant as failing the entire examination or as disqualified for subsequent parts of an examination.

The City Manager’s Office will determine pass-points on all written examinations. In determining an examination’s pass-point, the City may take into consideration such factors as, but not limited to, an appropriate amount of candidates to interview, natural “breaks” in the score distribution, and the minimization of adverse impacts on the applicant pool.

City employees who have full-time, 32-hour part-time, probationary, limited-service or status as a reserve and are competing in an open recruitment for another position, and are required to take a written examination for screening purposes, shall be given extra credit equal to five percent (5%) of the individual’s passing score.

The City Manager may, at his discretion, include as part of the examination, tests which are qualifying only.

(e)   Notice of Examination Results: Applicants shall be notified by mail or email concerning the results of their participation in the selection process. Said notification shall indicate whether the applicant is being considered further in the recruitment process or if the applicant has been placed on the eligibility list. Except as set out below, no test scores will be released to applicants, except if required by the certifying agency, or in the case of a joint recruitment when written test scores may be released.

Notwithstanding the restriction on release of test scores above, a City employee who holds employment in a sworn designation in the Santa Maria Fire Department or Santa Maria Police Department and is participating in a promotional examination for a position other than Fire Chief or Police Chief in that same department may review the applicant’s own test scores for that recruitment, as follows. Once a candidate is appointed to the position, an applicant who participated may email a request to the Human Resources Division to review his or her own score(s), including written examination scores. The request must include the applicant’s preferred telephone contact number and at least three date/times during the applicant’s off-duty time and during normal City Hall business hours for the review. Human Resources staff will confirm the meeting date and time by email. At the meeting, the applicant can review his or her own scores for the recruitment, including scores on any written exam. Upon request the applicant may also receive debriefing from Human Resources staff concerning the applicant’s interview.

(f)   Inspection of Tests: All candidates may request to inspect their own test answer sheet within five (5) working days after the notifications of examination results. Any error in computation, if called to the attention of the City Manager within this period, shall be corrected. Such corrections will not, however, require invalidation of appointments previously made. A process for handling written complaints regarding test content or test procedures may be established in a joint recruitment.

(g)   Record: The record of each selection process shall be maintained in the City Manager’s Office for the period of three (3) years and shall include the applicants’ names and scores, method of testing, sample and scores of the examination, and the names of the proctors and/or oral board participants.

(h)  Selection Procedures: The selection procedures shall be conducted under the supervision of the City Manager or through his designated staff.

(i)   Exemption from Examination: A vacant position may be exempted from examination by the City Manager if it is to be filled by the assignment of an individual who is not presently a City employee but is performing duties of the position as part of a designated federal, State, local, or other rehabilitation training program. The training program must have job placement as a goal and the individual will be required to meet the minimum requirements for the position and have performed satisfactorily during the training period before probationary appointment may be authorized.

Upon concurrence of the department(s) concerned and with the approval of the City Manager, an employee may be placed in a vacancy in another class when a disabling condition prevents continuing performance of the duties in the present class or the employee is party to a layoff and has qualified for the vacancy. The disabled employee does not have to be on an eligibility list for the class to which the appointment is being made.

(j)   Physical Examinations: The City shall have the right to require a job-related physical examination of any applicant for employment or new employee and in addition shall have the right to require periodic medical examinations of all City employees. (Ord. 2019-01 § 7, eff. 3/21/19; Ord. 2014-02, eff. 4/17/14; Ord. 2013-02, eff. 4/4/13; Ord. 2012-02, eff. 4/5/12; Ord. 2011-02, eff. 5/5/2011; Ord. 2010-03, eff. 5/20/10; Ord. 2009-03, eff. 3/5/09; Ord. 2007-08, eff. 7/5/07; Ord. 99-08, eff. 4/16/99; Ord. 97-13, eff. 12/4/97; Prior Code § 2-37)

(b)  Eligibility List Order: All eligible receiving a total overall score of seventy percent (70%) and above, from the examination process, shall be certified to the eligibility list. Names appearing on the eligibility list shall be ranked in the order of their overall score or position placement. The appointing authority may select any eligible from the eligibility list who has been certified by the board.

(c)   Appointments: After receipt of the eligibility list, the appointing authority shall proceed with a job-related interview. The appointing authority or a designated representative may review the application forms and examination papers. Reports on file in the Human Resources Division and reference checks shall be used prior to the actual offer of employment. When a decision has been made, the appointing authority shall immediately return a copy of the certified eligibility list with the appropriate job-related comments in reference to his or her employment decision, pursuant to the City’s Equal Opportunity in Employment Plan, to the City Manager for approval. The appointing authority is also responsible to provide all notifications to those candidates who continue in the examination process after the eligibility list has been established. No appointment is official until the City Manager signs and files a formal document appointing the applicant to a job position following successful completion of all employment procedures. Until formal appointment is made in this manner, any offers of City employment are conditional and preliminary and may be withdrawn.

(d)  Duration of Lists: An eligibility list shall be in effect from the date it is certified by the City Manager. It shall remain in effect up to six (6) months and will expire at that time unless the City Manager, after review with the appropriate appointing authority, extends the list.

An eligibility list may be extended for a period not greater than an additional six (6) months by the City Manager when it appears to be in the best interest of the City, except in the case of a joint recruitment when an eligibility list may be extended for a period not greater than an additional eighteen (18) months. The City Manager may abolish a promotional recruitment eligibility list when fewer than three (3) names remain on the list or when a certification of three (3) active eligibles is not available. The City Manager may abolish an open recruitment eligibility list when fewer than four (4) names remain on the list or when a certification of four (4) active eligibles is not available. Active eligibles on an abolished list shall be given the opportunity to reapply for the classification or have their names integrated in the newly established list if the selection procedure has not changed, for a period not to exceed the life of the newly established list. In order to make their determination, eligibles may be notified of their score. If eligibles decide to have their names integrated in the newly established list, such integration may be granted only once for any eligibility list.

(e)   Removal from Lists: The name of an eligible may be removed from an eligibility list by the City Manager:

(1)  For any cause in these chapters deemed sufficient for disqualification of application or dismissal from the City service;

(2)  On evidence that the eligible cannot be located by the postal authorities;

(3)  On receipt of a statement from the eligible indicating a lack of interest in the class or the City service;

(4)  If more than one offer of an appointment to the class for which the eligibility list was established has been declined by the eligible;

(5)  If eligibles on a promotional list are separated from City services, their names shall be removed from the list; and/or

(6)  If an eligible accepts a job with another agency participating in a joint recruitment. (Ord. 2014-02, eff. 4/17/14; Ord. 2010-03, eff. 5/20/10; Ord. 2007-08, eff. 7/5/07; Ord. 2006-02, eff. 3/21/2006; Ord. 2005-01, eff. 3/3/05; Ord. 99-08, eff. 4/16/99)

 

Section 2-20.10.2. Probation.
(a)   Purpose: The probationary period is the final step in the selection process; it is an extension of the examination process and the employee’s performance shall be carefully observed and documented through the performance appraisal process.

(b)  Duration of Probationary Period: Each appointment or promotion made to a full-time or part-time position in City service shall be subject to a probationary period; for the length of the probationary period, refer to existing memoranda of understanding or applicable resolution.

(c)   Successful Completion of Probationary Period: If the employee’s performance has been satisfactory and advancement to regular status is warranted, the department director shall so state in the employee’s final probationary performance evaluation report. The employee shall then be advanced to regular status.

(d)  Rejection of Probationer: If the employee’s performance has not been satisfactory, the department director with the approval of the City Manager may terminate any employee during the probationary period. The employee shall have no right of appeal during the probationary period, but shall be afforded the opportunity to respond to the proposed disciplinary action pursuant to the then-current CAM.

In the event the probationary employee is subject to disciplinary action, other than termination, the department director of the employee shall deliver to the employee a written notice of the proposed action, the reasons supporting the proposed action, and a statement that the employee may respond, either orally, in writing, or both, to the proposed action as prescribed in the appropriate memoranda of understanding, resolution or CAM.

(e)   Rejection Following Promotion: A promoted employee who does not successfully complete a probationary period will be restored to the same or similar position (if available) in the same class from which promoted unless charges are filed and employee is discharged in the manner provided for in these chapters. If there is no vacancy for such position, the employee may request to be placed on a re-employment list.

(f)   Extension of Probationary Period: It is not the City’s general policy to extend probationary periods; however, a probationary period may be extended beyond the duration of time called for in these chapters if the department director feels the extension is necessary to best judge the employee’s ability and such extension is approved by the City Manager.

Section 3-9.01. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Regulations of the City. (Prior Code § 24-10)

 

Section 3-9.02. Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter:

(a)   “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

(b)  “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

(c)   “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

(d)  “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

(e)   “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

(f)   “Tax Administrator” means the Director of Administrator Services of the City.

(g)   “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel is a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy, but only if the hotel is located in a zone that permits occupancy for more than thirty (30) consecutive days. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 2016-05 § 11, eff. 3/2/16; Prior Code § 24-11)

 

Section 3-9.03. Imposed: Rate.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 91-27 § 1, eff. 12/5/91; Prior Code § 24-12)

 

Section 3-9.04. Allocation of revenue.
(a)   The two percent (2%), reflecting the 1992 increase in this rate, shall be collected commencing on January 1, 1992, and be placed in the City’s general fund to be used for general municipal purposes.

This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit. (Prior Code § 24-15)

(d)  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent (1/2%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

(b)  As soon as the Tax Administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter.

(c)   Following the giving of due process as provided in subsections (d) and (e), the Tax Administrator shall have full authority to enter upon the premises of the operator where the business records of the hotel are maintained during normal business hours, and shall have the right and authority to require the records to be made available to him for examination and to examine the same in order to obtain the information required by the Tax Administrator in order to make the determination provided for in subsection (b) of this section and to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

(d)  In case the determination provided for in subsection (b) of this section is made, the Tax Administrator shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount so assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable.

(e)   If the application for hearing provided for in subsection (d) of this section is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.

The City Manager or his or her designees are hereby authorized to administer the provisions of this ordinance and any franchise issued pursuant thereto, and to provide any notices (including noncompliance notices) and to take any action on the City’s behalf that may be required hereunder or under applicable law.

(c)   No waiver. The failure of the City, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under a franchise or any other applicable law shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance, unless such right has been specifically waived in writing.

(d)  Administration of public, educational and government access. The City may designate one or more entities, including itself, to control and manage the use of public, educational and government access channels, facilities and equipment.

 

Section 4-11.07. Transfers.
(a)   Prior approval required. Every franchise shall be deemed to be held in trust, and to be personal to the franchisee. Any transfer that is made without the prior approval of the City shall be deemed to impair that trust. A transfer is any transaction pursuant to which:

(1)  A cable communications system is sold or assigned (except the term does not include sale of portions of the cable system that are removed);      

(2)  There is any change, acquisition, or transfer of control of the franchisee or its direct or indirect parents, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or ownership interests, or by any other means. A transfer will be deemed to have occurred whenever there is a change, acquisition or transfer of control of more than a ten-percent 10% ownership in the franchisee or its direct or indirect parents by any entity, or a group of entities acting in concert. However, a transfer also occurs whenever there is a change in actual working control, in whatever manner exercised, over the affairs of a franchisee or its direct or indirect parents. Without limiting the above, any change in the general partners of a franchisee will be presumed a change in control; or

(3)  The rights and/or obligations held by the franchisee under the franchise are transferred, sold, assigned, or leased, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to another party.

(b)  Exception for mortgages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable communications system to secure the construction, operation, or repair of the system may be made without application and without the City’s prior consent. However, no such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect under any condition:

(1)  Prevent the cable communications system operator or any successor from complying with the franchise or applicable law; or

(2)  Permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control the system, without the prior consent of the City. Any mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject to and subordinate to the rights of the City under any franchise, this chapter, or other applicable law.

 

Section 4-11.08. General conditions upon construction, operation and repair.
(a)   Franchisee must follow local rules. The construction, operation, and repair of cable communications systems shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules, regulations, and practices affecting such system. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning and safety codes, construction standards, regulations for providing notice to persons that may be affected by system construction, and directives governing the time, place and manner in which facilities may be installed in the rights of way. Persons engaged in the construction, operation, or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities and shall use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property.

(b)  No permit without franchise. A franchise is required before a permit may be issued for work associated with the construction of a cable communications system. Any permit issued for such work to a person that does not hold a franchise shall vest no rights in the permittee; the permit may be revoked at will, and the permittee shall remove all facilities installed under the permit upon the City’s demand.

(c)   Permits must be obtained. Construction, operation, or repair of a cable communications system shall not commence until all required permits have been obtained from the proper City officials and all required fees have been paid. All work performed will be performed in strict accordance with the conditions of the permit. Upon order of the City, any work and/or construction undertaken that is not completed in compliance with the City’s requirements, or which is installed without obtaining necessary permits and approvals shall be removed.

(d)  No interference. Interference with the use of the public rights of-way by others, including others that may be installing cable communications systems, must be minimized. The City may require a person using the rights of way to cooperate with others through joint trenching and other arrangements to minimize adverse impacts on the rights of way.

(e)   Existing poles to be used. To the extent possible, operators of cable communications systems shall use existing poles and conduit. Additional poles may not be installed in the right of way, nor may pole capacity be increased by vertical or horizontal extenders, without the permission of the City Manager.

(f)   Undergrounding.

(1)  Whenever existing telephone or electric utilities are located underground in an area in the City, every cable communications system operator that wishes to place its facilities in the same area must locate its cable communications system underground.

(2)  Whenever the owner of a pole locates or relocates underground within an area of the City, every cable communications system operator in the same area shall concurrently relocate its facilities underground.

(3)  The City Manager may, for good cause shown, exempt a particular system or facility or group of facilities from the obligation to locate or relocate facilities underground, where relocation is impractical, or where the interest in protecting against visual blight can be protected in another manner. Nothing in this section prevents the City from ordering communications facilities to be located or relocated underground under other provisions of the City Municipal Code.

(g)   Prompt repairs. Any and all public rights of way, other public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation or repair of a cable communications system shall be promptly repaired by the operator, within time frames required by the City Public Works Director or representative. Public property and public rights of way must be restored, to the satisfaction of the City, to a condition as good or better than before the disturbance or damage occurred.

(h)  Movement of facilities for government.

(1)  A cable communications system operator shall, by a time specified by the City, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the City by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right of way construction and repair (including re-grading, resurfacing or widening); public right of way vacation, construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government owned system or utility, public work, public facility, or improvement or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the cable communications system. Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the “public work.”

(2)  The City shall provide written notice describing where the public work is to be performed at least thirty (30) days prior to the deadline by which a cable communications system operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. Provided that, in an emergency, or where a cable communications system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the City may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the cable communications system without prior notice, and charge the cable communications system operator for costs incurred.

(i)   Movement for others.

(1)  To accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person authorized to use the streets or public property, a franchisee shall, by a time specified by such person or by the City, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. The franchisee must be given written notice describing where the construction, operation or repair is to be performed at least thirty (30) days prior to the time by which its work must be completed. The City may, as it deems appropriate, resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs associated with removal, relaying, or relocation of facilities among entities authorized to install facilities in the streets or on public property if such entities are unable to do so themselves. Such resolution by the City shall have the force and effect of binding arbitration upon the entities. Alternatively, the City may designate a neutral arbiter, whose decision shall be final.

(2)  A cable communications system operator shall, on the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires by a time specified to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. A cable communications system operator shall be given not less than seven (7) days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid in advance by the person requesting the same.

(j)   Abandonment in place.

(1)  A cable communications system operator may abandon any property in place in the public rights of way upon written notice to the City. However, if, within ninety (90) days of the receipt of written notice of abandonment, the City determines, that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public right-of way and facilities in the public right of way will be adversely affected, the property must be removed by a date specified by the City.

(2)  A cable communications system operator that abandons its property must, upon request, transfer ownership of the properties to the City at no cost, and execute necessary quitclaim deeds and indemnify the City against future costs associated with mitigating or eliminating any environmental hazard associated with the abandoned property.

(k)  Systems subject to inspection. Every cable communications facility shall be subject to inspection and testing by the City. Each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the City may from time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated, or repaired. Each operator shall cooperate and assist fully in facilitating the inspection of equipment permitted by this section, including, without limitation, any disassembly required to allow inspection of interior portions of the facility.

(l)   Underground services alert. Each operator of a cable communications system that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (Underground Services Alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The operator shall locate its facilities for the City at no charge.

(m) Plan for construction. Each cable communications system operator shall provide the City a plan for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the City that will be affected.

(n)  Use of facilities by City. The City shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge, upon any poles or in any conduit owned by a franchisee any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable service operations of the franchisee.

(o)  Provision for future expansion. Each cable communications system operator shall provide in plans for construction and refurbishment of facilities sufficient empty conduit, fiber, and cabling to meet the projected needs of the communications system operator and any anticipated co user of the facilities constructed, in order to prevent unnecessary disturbance to public facilities and the community at a future date.

 

Section 4-11.09. Protection of the City and residents.
(a)   Indemnity required. No franchise shall be valid or effective until and unless the City Risk Manager approves the indemnity and insurance to be provided by the franchisee. The indemnity, at a minimum. must:

(1)  Release the City from and against any and all liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable communications system. Each cable communications system must further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from the City in connection with the above mentioned matters.

(2)  Indemnify and hold harmless the City, its trustees, elected and appointed officers, agents, and employees, from and against any and all claims, demands, or causes of action of any kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys’ fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees sustained by the City or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of the acts, errors, or omissions of the cable communications system operator, or its agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the system.

(b)  Insurance required. A franchisee (or those acting on its behalf) shall not commence construction or operation of the system without obtaining insurance in amounts and of a type satisfactory to the City. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period that the franchisee has facilities in the rights of way. If the franchisee, its contractors, or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the City may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved.

(c)   Proof. Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance and naming the City as an additional insured, and other proofs as the City may find necessary, shall be filed with the City. For persons issued franchises after the effective date of this ordinance, certificates and other required proofs shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the issuance of a franchise, once a year thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the rights of way as of the effective date of this chapter, the certificate shall be filed within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this chapter, annually thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage, unless a pre existing franchise provides for filing of certificates in a different manner.

(d)  Certificate contents. Certificates shall contain a provision that coverage afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least thirty (30) days prior written notice has been given to the City. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the State of California.

(e)   Insurance amounts. A cable communications system operator (and those acting on its behalf to construct or operate the system) shall maintain the following minimum insurance. The City shall be named as an additional insured on the general liability and automotive policies; those insurance policies shall be primary and contain a cross liability clause.

(f)   Performance bond. Every operator of a cable communications system shall obtain and maintain a performance bond to ensure the faithful performance of its responsibilities under this chapter and any franchise. The amount of the performance and payment bonds shall be set by the City Manger or may be set in a franchise ordinance in light of the nature of the work to be performed, but shall not be less than ten-percent (10%) of the estimated cost of constructing or (in the case of existing systems) upgrading the system. The bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Bonds must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise.

(g)   Security fund. Every cable communications system operator shall establish and maintain a cash security fund or provide the City an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise, and to pay any taxes, fees or liens owed to the City. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the City’s Director of Finance and in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Should the City draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, the cable communications system operator shall, within fourteen (14) days, restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by the City for a franchisee where the City determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee’s operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. The City may from time to time require a franchisee to change the amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect changed risks to the City and to the public, including delinquencies in taxes or other payments to the City. The cash security fund or letter of credit must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise. (Ord. 2017-01 § 56, eff. 3/9/17)

 

Section 4-11.10. Enforcement and remedies.
(a)   Revocation and termination. The City Council may, after thirty (30) days’ written notice, revoke a franchise or reduce the term of a franchise if it finds, after a hearing, that a cable communications system operator has violated this chapter or its franchise; has defrauded or attempted to defraud the City or subscribers; or has attempted to evade the requirements of this chapter or its franchise. Except as to violations that are impossible to cure, and as provided in Sections 4-11.10(2) (3), the franchise may only be revoked if the franchisee;

(1)  Was given notice of the default;

(2)  Thirty (30) days to cure the default; and;

(3)  The franchisee failed to cure the default, or to propose a schedule for curing the default acceptable to the City where it is impossible to cure the default in thirty (30) days.

(b)  Exception for certain acts. No opportunity to cure is required for repeated violations, and fraud and attempted fraud shall be deemed incurable. Further, the City may declare a franchise forfeited without opportunity to cure where a franchisee;

(1)  Intentionally stops providing service it is required to provide; or

(2)  Transfers the franchise without the prior consent of the City.

(c)   Exception for bankruptcy. A franchise will terminate automatically by force of law one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. However, the franchise may be reinstated within that one hundred twenty (120) day period, if;

(1)  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or

(2)  Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise, and has executed an agreement, approved by any court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.

In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the City may revoke the franchise following a public hearing before the City Council, by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges thereunder will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless:

(3)  The City has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and

(4)  The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the City to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise and this chapter.

(d)  Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a franchise, whether by action of the City as provided above, or by passage of time, the franchisee must stop using the cable communications system for the purposes authorized by the franchise. The City may take possession of some or all of franchisee’s facilities, or require the franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the franchisee’s facilities from the City, and restore affected property to its same or better, condition. This provision does not permit the City to remove facilities that are used to provide another service for which the franchisee holds a valid franchise issued by the City.

(e)   Remedies cumulative. Remedies provided for under this chapter or under a franchise shall be cumulative. Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, does not limit a franchisee’s duty to indemnify the City; or relieve a franchisee of its franchise obligations or limit the amounts owed to the City.

(f)   Penalties. Any person violating the provisions of this article shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall punished as specified in California Penal Code Section 19, as amended.

(g)   Generally. Each cable communications system operator shall provide the City access to books and records related in whole or in part to the construction, operation, or repair of the cable communications system. or a group of systems of which the system is a part, so that the City may inspect and copy these books and records, which are hereby acknowledged to be of a confidential and proprietary nature. The records include, but are not limited to revenue records, and other records related to compliance with any provision of this chapter or a franchise. A franchisee is responsible for obtaining or maintaining the necessary possession or control of all such books and records, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records must be maintained for a period of five years, except that a franchise may specify a shorter period for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the information contained therein can be derived simply from other materials. The phrase “books and records” shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored.

(h)  Production. Books and records requested shall be produced to the City by a time and at a location in the City designated by the City Manager. However, if the requested books and records are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied and moved, then the franchisee may request that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to by the City and the franchisee, provided that (1) the franchisee must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by the City after its review; and (2) the franchisee must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the City (above those that would have been incurred had the documents been produced in the City) in inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its designee.

 

Section 4-11.11. Reports.

(2)  The total estimated hours of known outages as a percentage of total hours of operation. An outage is a loss of sound or video on any signal, or a significant deterioration of any signal affecting two or more subscribers.

(c)   Annual reports. Unless an exemption is granted by the City Manager, no later than ninety (90) days after the end of its fiscal year, a franchisee shall submit the following information, except that the information required by subsection (3) need only be provided where there has been a change from the preceding year:

(1)  A fully audited or certified revenue report from the previous calendar year for the cable communications system, and a certified statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding year and a detailed explanation of the method of computation showing

(A)  Gross revenues by category (e.g., basic, pay, pay per view, advertising, installation, equipment, late charges, miscellaneous, other); and

(B)  What, if any, deductions were made from gross revenues in calculating the franchise fee (e.g., bad debt, credits and refunds), and the amount of each deduction.

Revenues and deductions shall be reported in a format and in categories approved by the City Manager.

(2)  A report showing, for each applicable customer service standard (Appendix of this chapter), the franchisee’s performance with respect to that standard for each quarter of the preceding year. In each case where franchisee concludes it did not comply fully, the franchisee will describe the corrective actions it is taking to assure future compliance. In addition, the report should identify the number and nature of the customer service complaints received and an explanation of their dispositions.

(3)  An ownership report, indicating all persons whom at the time of filing control or own an interest in the franchisee of ten percent (10%) or more.

(d)  Contemporaneous Reports. Within ten (10) days of their receipt or (in the case of documents created by the operator or its affiliate) filing, a franchisee shall provide the City:

(1)  Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the system; and

(2)  Any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the franchisee directly or indirectly.

 

Section 4-11.12. Maps required.
Each franchisee shall maintain accurate maps and improvement plans which show the location, size, and a general description of all facilities installed in the public rights of way and any power supply sources (including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based upon post construction inspection to verify location. Each franchisee shall, upon request, provide a map to the City showing the location of its facilities, in such detail and scale as may be directed by the City Engineer and update the map at least annually, and whenever the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps shall be provided on disk, in a commercially available electronic format specified by the City Engineer.

 

Section 4-11.13. Other records required.
Unless the City Manager waives the requirement, a franchisee shall at all time, maintain:

(a)   Complaint records. Records of all complaints received their nature and resolution. The term “complaints” refers to complaints about any aspect of the franchisee’s operations.

(b)  Outage records. Records of outages known to the franchisee, their cause and duration.

(d)  Installation records. Records of installation/reconnection and requests for service extension, indicating date of request, date of acknowledgment, and the date and time service was extended.

(e)   Customer service. Records sufficient to show whether the franchisee has complied with each customer service standard that applies to it.

 

Section 4-11.14. Exemptions.
The City Manager may temporarily exempt any franchisee from its obligations under Sections 4-11.10 through 4-11.13 if the City Manager determines that the requirement would be unduly burdensome or unnecessary, and that City and subscriber interests may be adequately protected in some other manner.

 

Section 4-11.15. Privacy.
A franchisee shall take all reasonable steps required so that it is able to provide reports, books and records to the City, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each franchisee shall be responsible for redacting data that applicable law prevents it from providing to the City. Nothing in this section shall be read to require a franchisee to violate state or federal subscriber privacy laws.

 

Section 4-11.16. Procedures for paying franchise fees and fees in lieu of franchise fees.
(a)   Fees paid quarterly. The franchise fee paid shall be paid quarterly unless otherwise specified in a franchise. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the City not later than forty five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter.

(b)  Quarterly statement. Unless a franchise provides otherwise, a franchisee or other entity subject to a fee under Article 2 or 3 shall file with the City within forty five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter a statement showing gross revenues during the preceding quarter and the number of subscribers served.

(c)   Acceptance of payment not a release. No acceptance by the City of any payment shall be construed, as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable.

(d)  Fee not in lieu of taxes. Neither the franchise fee under Article 2, nor the fee paid in lieu of the franchise fee under Article 3 is a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment of general applicability (including any such tax, fee or assessment imposed on both utilities and cable operators or their services, but not including a tax, fee, or assessment which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or cable subscribers).

(e)   Failure to pay franchise fee. In the event that a fee payment is not received by the City on or before the due date, or the fee owed is not fully paid, the person subject to the fee will be charged interest from the due date at an interest rate equal to three percentage points (3%) above the rate for three month Federal Treasury Bills at the most recent United States Treasury Department sale of such Treasury Bills occurring prior to the due date of the franchise fee payment.

(f)   Final statement of gross revenues. Within ninety (90) days of the date a franchisee ceases operations under a franchise (whether because of franchise termination, transfer, bankruptcy or for any other reason), the franchisee shall file a final statement of gross revenues covering the period from the beginning of the calendar year in which the operations ceased to the date operations ceased. The statement shall contain the information and be certified as required by Section 4-11.11(3).

 

Section 4-11.17. Applications Generally.

Section 4-11.18. Application for an initial franchise or renewal franchise
(a)   Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to an application for an initial franchise, or a renewal franchise application that is not governed by 47 U.S.C. §546(a) (h).

(b)  Process. Any person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise by submitting an application therefore on that person’s own initiative, or in response to a request for proposals issued by the City. If the City receives an unsolicited application, it may choose to issue a request for additional proposals, and require the applicant to amend its proposal to respond thereto. The City shall promptly conduct such investigations as are necessary to act on an application.

(c)   Consideration of application. In determining whether to grant a franchise, the City may consider:

(1)  The extent to which an applicant for renewal has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise;

(2)  Whether an applicant for renewal’s quality of service under its existing Franchise, including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like has been reasonable in light of the needs of the community;

(3)  Where the applicant has not previously held a cable system franchise in the City, whether the applicant’s record in other communities indicates that it can be relied upon to provide high quality service throughout any franchise term;

(4)  Whether the applicant has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in an application, and to satisfy any minimum requirements established by the City;

(5)  Whether the applicant’s application is reasonable to meet the future cable related needs and interests of the City, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests;

(6)  Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on streets, public property, and private property that will be used by the applicant’s cable system;

(7)  Whether issuance of the franchise would reduce competition in the provision of cable service in the City;

(8)  Such other matters as the City is authorized or required to consider.

(d)  Issuance of franchise. If the City determines that issuance of a franchise would be in the public interest considering the factors described above, it may proffer a franchise agreement to the applicant. No franchise shall become effective until the applicant unconditionally accepts the franchise, and the franchise agreement is signed.

(c)   Consideration of application. In determining whether a transfer application should be granted, denied, or granted subject to conditions, the City may consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its franchise; whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the City, whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the City; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would otherwise adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the City’s interest under this chapter, the franchise, or other applicable law. The proposed transferee shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the City in reviewing and evaluating the applications.

(d)  Minimum conditions. In order to obtain approval of a transfer, an applicant must show, at a minimum that: the transferee is qualified; the transfer will not adversely affect the interests of subscribers, the public, or the City; and that noncompliance issues have been resolved.

(7)  For purposes of this section the term applicant includes any affiliate of applicant.

(b)  Exception.           Notwithstanding Section 4-11.21(l), an applicant shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should issue even if the requirements of Section 4-11.21 (1)(c) (d) are not satisfied, by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant’s principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system.

 

Section 4-11.22. Franchise fee.

Section 4-11.23. No exclusivity.
(a)   A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager to enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing service. However, nothing herein prevents a franchisee from entering into an otherwise lawful, mutually desired exclusive arrangement with a building owner or manager of a multiple dwelling unit or commercial subscriber.

(b)  No franchisee shall enter into or cooperate with any agreement with any other utility, cable system, OVS or other entity which provides for the exclusive right to attach equipment to utility poles or use underground conduit. This provision is not intended, however, to interfere with any utility, cable system, OVS or other entity from obtaining reasonable compensation for the use of their facilities by other entities.

 

Section 4-11.24. Minimum franchise conditions.
In addition to satisfying such additional or stricter conditions as the City finds necessary based on its investigations, the following elements shall be required in every franchise serving more than one thousand (1000) subscribers: An operator who provides service in an area which is defined as “isolated rural” may be exempted from the minimum franchise requirements for that area.

(1)  A franchisee shall provide channels for PEG access to each subscriber; the number of channels shall be specified in the franchise.

(2)  Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace as necessary, a dedicated, bi directional fiber optic link between its headend and a location designated by the City as the primary access center.

(3)  Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace activated two way cable plant and all headend, cable plant, and node equipment required to make it operable so that the City, schools, and all designated PEG access centers and access facilities located within the franchise area will be able to send and receive signals (video, audio, and data) using the activated two way cable plant.

(4)  Each franchisee shall ensure that technically adequate signal quality, routing systems, and switching and/or processing equipment are initially and continuously provided for all access interconnections both within franchisee’s cable system and with other cable systems throughout the duration of its franchise.

(5)  In the event a franchisee makes any change in the cable system and related equipment and facilities or in the franchisee’s signal delivery technology which directly or indirectly substantially affects the signal quality or transmission of access programming, the franchisee shall at its expense take necessary steps or provide necessary technical assistance, including the acquisition of all necessary equipment, to ensure that the capabilities of access programmers are not diminished or adversely affected by such change.

(6)  A franchisee shall maintain all access channels (both upstream channels and downstream channels) and all interconnections of access channels at the same level of technical quality and reliability as the best commercial channels carried on the system.

(c)   Service to franchise area. It is the policy of the City to ensure that every cable system provides service in its franchise area upon request to any person or any government building. Each franchisee shall extend service upon request within its franchise area, provided that, a franchise may permit a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to contribute a fair share of the capital costs of installation or extension as a condition of extension or installation in cases where such extension or installation may be unduly expensive. Service must be provided within time limits specified in Section 4-11.24 (4).

(d)  Time for extension. Except as a franchise otherwise provides, service must be extended upon request to any person or to any government building in a franchisee’s franchise area (1) within seven (7) days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop; (2) within ninety (90) days of the request where an extension of one half mile or less is required; or (3) within six (6) months where an extension of one half mile or more is required.

(f)   Testing. Each cable operator shall perform at its expense such tests as may be necessary to show whether or not the franchisee is in compliance with its obligations under applicable FCC standards, this chapter or a franchise.

(g)   Interconnection. Upon request of the City, every cable system shall be required to interconnect with every other cable system within the City, or adjacent to the City, on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of providing PEG and I Net services.

(h)  Continuity of service. Each franchisee shall, during the term of the franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous service. In the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be required to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity. A franchise may establish more particular requirements under which these obligations will be satisfied.

 

Section 4-11.25. Rate regulation and consumer protection.
(a)   All rates subject to regulation. The City may regulate any of the cable operator’s rates and charges, except to the extent it is prohibited from doing so by law. If the City chooses to regulate rate it will regulate rates in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, where applicable. Except to the extent FCC rules provide otherwise, all rates and charges that are subject to regulation, and changes in those rates or charges must be approved in advance. The City Manager may take any required steps to file complaints, toll rates, issue accounting orders or take any other steps required to comply with FCC regulations. The City Council shall be responsible for issuing rate orders that establish rates or order refunds.

(b)  No rate discrimination. Except to the extent the City may not enforce such a requirement, a cable operator is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a non discriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the franchise area; and a franchisee may offer discounts for the elderly, the disabled, or the economically disadvantaged; and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under Federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.

(c)   Redlining prohibited. A cable operator shall not deny access or charge different rates for the same services to any group of subscribers or potential subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.

(d)  Customer service.

(1)  Each cable operator must satisfy FCC, State and City cable customer service standards or consumer protection standards. City cable customer service standards may be adopted by resolution. In the case of a conflict among standards, the stricter standard shall apply.

(2)  For violation of cable customer service standards (Appendix A), penalties will be imposed as follows:

(A)  Two hundred dollars ($200) for each day of each material breach, not to exceed six hundred dollars ($600) for each occurrence of material breach.

(B)  If there is a subsequent material breach of the same provision within twelve (12) months, four hundred ($400) for each day of each material breach, not to exceed twelve hundred dollars ($1200) for each occurrence of the material breach.

(3)  Any penalty assessed under this section will be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent any liquidated damage provision of a franchise imposes a monetary obligation on a franchisee for the same customer service failures, and no other monetary damages may be assessed. The City will provide notice, and impose penalties, under this section pursuant to the procedures established by California Government Code § 53088.2(r).

25.1.    Franchisee shows that there is an alternative standard that is substantially similar to that established by this article;

25.2.    The City Manager determines that there is sufficient competition among cable operators that renders application of these standards unnecessary; or

(the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 [“DIVCA”]), to serve any location(s) within the incorporated boundaries of the City. It is the purpose of this Chapter to implement within the incorporated boundaries of the City the provisions of DIVCA and the rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated there under that are applicable to a “local franchising entity” or a “local entity” as defined in DIVCA.

(b)  Rights Reserved.

(1)  The rights reserved to the City under this Chapter 4-11A are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by Section 4-11A.01 or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any other rights which may be held by the City.

(2)  Nothing contained in this Chapter 4-11A shall ever be construed so as to exempt a State franchise holder from compliance with all ordinances, rules or regulations of the City now in effect or which may be hereafter adopted which are consistent with this Chapter or California Public Utilities Code section 5800 et seq. (Ord. 2008-05, eff. 4/17/08)

The State franchise holder shall deliver to the City, by check or other means, which shall be agreed to by the City, a separate payment for the State franchise fee not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter. Each payment made shall be accompanied by a report, detailing how the payment was calculated, and shall include such additional information on the appropriate form as designated by the City.

(3)  Late Payments. In the event a State franchise holder fails to make payments required by this section on or before the due dates specified in this section, the City shall be authorized to impose a late charge at the rate per year equal to the highest prime lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus one percent (1%), as required by Public Utilities Code Section 5860 (h).

(b)  PEG Fees and Institutional Networks.

(1)  Any State franchise holder operating within the incorporated areas of the City shall pay to the City, or if directed by the City, pay to the City’s designated PEG provider, a PEG support fee equal to three percent of gross revenues, as allowed by Section 5870(n) of the DIVCA.

Section 4-11A.05. PEG Channel Capacity, Interconnection, Signal Carriage Requirements.
(a)   PEG Channel Capacity.

(1)  A State franchisee that has been authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission to provide video service in the City shall designate and activate three PEG channels within three months from the date that the City requests that the State franchisee designate and activate these PEG channels. However, this three-month period shall be tolled for such a period, and only for such a period, during which the State franchisee’s ability to designate or provide such PEG capacity is technically infeasible, as set forth in Sections 5870(a), 5870(c) and 5870(h) of the California Public Utilities Code.

(2)  A State franchisee shall provide an additional PEG channel when the standards set forth in Section 5870(d) of the California Public Utilities Code are satisfied by the City or any entity designated by the City to manage one or more of the PEG channels.

(b)  PEG Signal Carriage and Interconnection.

(1)  As set forth in Sections 5870(b) and 5870(g)(3) of the California Public Utilities Code, State franchisees shall ensure that all PEG channels are receivable by all subscribers, whether they receive digital or analog service, or a combination thereof, without the need for any equipment other than that needed to receive the lowest cost tier of service. PEG access capacity provided by a State franchisee shall be of similar quality and functionality to that offered by commercial channels, shall be capable of carrying a National Television System Committee (NTSC) quality television signal, and shall be carried on the State franchisee’s lowest cost tier of service. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited by law. After the initial designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without the agreement of the City unless law requires the change.

(2)  As set forth in Section 5870(h) of the California Public Utilities Code, the holder of a State franchise and an incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG programming. If a State franchisee and an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement for PEG carriage, the City shall require the incumbent cable operator to allow the State franchisee to interconnect its network with the incumbent cable operator’s network at a technically feasible point on the State franchisee’s network as identified by the State franchisee. If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available, the State franchisee shall make interconnection available to each PEG channel originator programming a channel in the City and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the State franchisee requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. In no case shall the City be required to incur any cost as a result of this section. (Ord. 2008-05, eff. 4/17/08)

 

Section 4-11A.06. Audit Rights.
(a)   Not more than once annually, the holder of a State video franchise in the City shall submit to the City Manager or his designee business records for the purpose of examination and audit to ensure compliance with this Chapter, in a manner consistent with California Public Utilities Code Section 5860(i).

(b)  The holder shall keep all business records reflecting any gross revenues, even if there is a change in ownership, for at least four years after those revenues are recognized by the holder on its books and records; See Public Utilities Code Section 5860(i). If the examination discloses that the holder has underpaid franchise fees by more than five percent (5%) during the examination period, the holder shall pay all of the reasonable and actual costs of the examination.

Section 4-12.25. Ownership of equipment immaterial.
Performance of the duty of rendering compensation under any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter and of any or every other obligation under the franchise shall not be excused by the fact that the grantee may utilize under any arrangement whatsoever any buses, equipment or facilities required by it in maintaining its services and operations from any other person or entity. The grantee, by accepting the franchise as provided in this chapter, agrees that its obligations under the franchise, including the day of payment of compensation thereunder, shall apply to all such buses, equipment and facilities so utilized, whether owned by it or not, whenever such buses, equipment or facilities constitute all or any part of the bus system operated within the City by the grantee, including any buses, equipment and facilities installed or maintained outside the City, but which form a part of the grantee’s bus system operation within the City, including but not limited to such facilities as maintenance shops or standby equipment.

Section 4-12.26. Business license.
The gross receipts fee paid by the franchisee in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-12.24 is a payment for the privilege of operating a bus system on the City streets and is not a business license fee. The franchisee must therefore pay a business license fee in accordance with the terms of Chapter 4-1; provided, however, that after the first five years of operation the payment of the franchise fee by the applicant shall be regarded as a sufficient payment in lieu of a business license fee, and thereafter no business license fee shall be charged the applicant for operating the business in accordance with the franchise granted under this chapter. (Prior Code § 14B-13)

 

Section 4-12.27. Bond.
(a)   The grantee shall, concurrently with the acceptance of any franchise granted under this chapter, file with the City Clerk, and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the term of the franchise, at its sole expense, a corporate surety bond, issued by a surety licensed to issue such bonds in this state, and in a form to be approved by the City Attorney, in an amount approved by the Council, renewable annually and conditioned upon the faithful performance by the grantee of all obligations imposed by such franchise and this chapter and all applicable laws, and specifically including the payment of the annual franchise fees and business license fees as provided in this chapter.

(b)  Neither the provisions of this section, nor the acceptance of any bond by the City pursuant to this section, nor any damages actually recovered by the City, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee for damages for any act or omission violating the terms of this chapter or of any provision of this Code or the resolution granting the franchise, or any law of the state. (Prior Code § 14B-14)

 

Section 4-12.28. Indemnification of City: Insurance.
(a)   The grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the City and its officers, employees and agents from any and all liability for damages resulting from any operations under its franchise, and agree that at all times during the existence of the franchise it will maintain in force, furnish and file with the City, at its own expense, a general comprehensive liability insurance policy, provided by a company authorized to do business in the state, in the form approved by the City Attorney, protecting the City, its Council, board, commissions, members thereof, and all officers, employees and agents against liability for loss or damages for personal injury, death and property damage occasioned by the operations of the grantee, with minimum liability limits of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for personal injury or death of any one (1) person, and three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for personal injury or death of two (2) or more persons in any one occurrence, and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for damage to property resulting from any one (1) occurrence.

(b)  The policies described in subsection (a) of this section shall name the City, its Council, boards, commissions, members thereof, officers, employees and agents as co-insured, and shall also contain a provision that a written notice of any cancellation or reduction in coverage of the policy shall be delivered to the City thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date thereof. No franchise granted under this chapter shall be effective unless and until each of the policies of insurance, as required in this section, and bonds, as required by Section 4-12.27, have been delivered to the City. (Prior Code § 14B-15)

 

Section 4-12.29. Compliance with law: Conflicting laws.
(a)   Any person operating a bus under a franchise granted under the terms of this chapter shall be required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the state and the United States Government in addition to the requirements of this chapter and of the resolution granting the franchise and orders and conditions imposed upon the franchisee under the terms of this chapter.

(b)  Any part of this chapter in conflict with the laws or regulations of the state or the United States, or of any lawfully established regulatory body, commission or agency of either of them, or which may be brought in conflict therewith by the amendment of such laws or regulations shall be void, but such invalidation shall not affect the remainder of the terms of this chapter, it being the intent of the Council in enacting this chapter that it shall supplement and complement the laws and regulations mentioned in this section so as to protect the interests of the City and its properties and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this City with regard to all bus operations permitted under this chapter. (Prior Code § 14B-16)

 

Section 4-12.30. Disqualification of sexual psychopaths and certain criminals.
No person holding a franchise issued under the terms of this chapter shall permit a bus to be driven by any individual who has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude at any time within ten (10) years preceding the time when it is proposed that the person drive such a bus, and in no event shall permit any individual who has at any time been convicted of a sexual offense under the laws of the state, or found under the laws of the state to have been a sexual psychopath.

Section 4-18.100. Purpose and Intent.
(a)   In enacting this Chapter, the City Council recognizes that commercial massage therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer the public valuable health and therapeutic services. The City Council further recognizes that unless properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses.

Section 5-1.03. Declared nuisance.
The City Council finds that the accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on public or private property in public view, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts thereof, on private or public property in public view, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, constitutes a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or part thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.

(f)   If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and that landowner has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the hearing officer shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such landowner.

Section 5-3.203. Notice and Hearing on Petition to Declare a Dog to be Restricted or Vicious.
(a)   Notice of Hearing and Petition. If an Animal Control Officer or a law enforcement officer has investigated and determined that there is probable cause that a dog is potentially vicious or restricted, the Animal Services Director shall set an administrative hearing, to determine whether or not the dog in question should be declared restricted or vicious.

(1)  Subsequent to the investigation showing probable cause that a dog is potentially vicious or restricted, the Animal Control Supervisor, Animal Control Officer or law enforcement officer shall prepare a petition that sets forth the allegation that the dog is potentially vicious or restricted and the supporting evidence.

(2)  Whenever possible, a complaint received from a member of the public which serves as the evidentiary basis for the Animal Control Officer or law enforcement officer to find probable cause shall be sworn to and verified by the complainant and shall be attached to the petition.

(3)  A notice of the hearing shall be personally served on the owner or custodian or deposited in the mail to the owner or custodian within fifteen (15) calendar days of the seizure of the dog. The Animal Services Director shall notify the owner or custodian of the dog that an administrative hearing will be held, at which time he or she may present evidence as to why the dog should not be declared restricted or vicious.

The hearing shall be held promptly within no less than five (5)  business days nor more than ten (10) business days after the service upon the owner or custodian of the dog. For the purposes of this article, service is complete either: (i) when the documents are personally served; or (ii) five (5) business days after the documents are deposited in the mail or when the return receipt is received back from the recipient, whichever is earlier.

(b)  Conduct of Hearing. The hearing shall be conducted as an administrative hearing open to the public. The administrative hearing officer may admit into evidence all relevant evidence, including incident reports and the affidavits of witnesses, limit the scope of discovery, and may shorten the time to produce records or witnesses. The administrative hearing officer may find, upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the dog is restricted or vicious and shall make other orders or findings required or authorized by this article. The administrative hearing officer may decide all issues for or against the owner or custodian of the dog, even if the owner or custodian fails to appear at the hearing. The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admissions of such evidence over objection in civil actions. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil actions, and irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

(1)  Administrative Hearing Officer. The hearing shall be conducted by a neutral hearing officer. Animal Services may authorize its own officer or employee to conduct the hearing if the hearing officer is not the same person who signed the petition or directed the seizure or impoundment of the dog, and is not junior in rank to that person(s). In the alternative, Animal Services may utilize the services of a hearing officer from outside the Department who is employed either by the County or by the City.

(2)  Administration of Oaths. The administrative hearing officer shall have the power to administer oaths or affirmations when necessary in conjunction with the hearing.

(3)  Record. The administrative hearing officer shall record the hearing on a recording device and shall make such recording available to the parties upon request.

(c)   Notice of Decision. Following the administrative hearing, a written notice of the decision shall be served on Animal Services and the owner or custodian of the dog either personally and/or by first class mail and certified mail return receipt requested within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of the hearing.

(d)  Consequences of Vicious Dog Determination.

(1)  A dog determined to be a vicious dog shall be euthanized by Animal Services when it is found, after proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section, that the release of the dog would create a significant threat to the public health, safety and welfare. If the dog determined to be vicious is not in the County’s possession, the owner or custodian shall surrender the dog to the County.

(2)  If it is determined that a dog found to be vicious shall not be destroyed, the administrative hearing officer shall impose conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. These conditions are limited to release to an approved animal rescue sanctuary for the remainder of the animal’s life and no possibility of adoption. The owner or custodian is responsible for ensuring payment of all fees, charges and associated costs related to this release.

(3)  The owner or custodian of a dog determined to be a vicious dog may be prohibited from owning, keeping, possessing or having custody of any dog for a period of up to three (3) years, if it is found at the hearing conducted pursuant to the petition to declare the dog vicious, that ownership or possession of a dog by that person would create a significant threat to the public health, safety and welfare.

(e)   Consequences of Restricted Dog Determination.

(1)  A dog determined to be a restricted dog shall be properly licensed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, and vaccinated at the owner or custodian’s expenses, prior to release to the owner or custodian if the dog was impounded.

Animal Services will include the designation “restricted” in the license registration records of the dog.

(3)  The administrative hearing officer may impose other restrictions as are determined by the hearing officer to be necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. This determination shall take into consideration factors presented at the hearing, including, but not limited to, the nature of the attack, the size and strength of the dog, and the circumstances of the aggressive behavior. If the dog has been impounded, the administrative hearing officer may order that the dog not be released back to the owner until the owner has demonstrated compliance to Animal Services. The restrictions that the administrative hearing officer may impose pursuant to this Subsection may include, but will not be limited to, the following:

If the charges and/or fines are not paid within fourteen (14) days after the services are performed or the fines are ordered to be paid, the dog shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be transferred, adopted or euthanized by the Department at its discretion.

(5)  The owner will advise Animal Services of his/her new address whenever the owner moves his/her residence or prior to re-homing the dog with the information of the name, address and phone number of the new owner.

(1)  The hearing officer who heard the petition to determine if a dog is potentially vicious or restricted or other administrative hearing officer may schedule follow-up hearing dates to ensure compliance with all conditions imposed.

(2)  Consequences that may result from the failure of an owner or custodian of a dog to comply with any of the imposed conditions under (d) or (e) above include, but are not limited, to the following:

(i)   The failure to comply with any condition shall be a violation of this Article that is punishable as a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand ($1,000) dollars or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment;

(ii)  A violation of any part of an administrative decision or court order may be the subject of a civil action for injunctive relief to enjoin the person who violated the decision or order. The filing and prosecution of an action for injunctive relief shall not limit the authority or ability of the County to take any other action permitted by law;

(iii) A violation of an administrative decision following a determination that a dog is a restricted dog, may result in the filing of a new action pursuant to Section 5-3.202 to determine if the dog is a “vicious dog” as defined under Section 5-3.101(t).

CHAPTER 5-7  SMOKING CONTROL ORDINANCE
Section 5-7.01. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the “Smoking Control Ordinance.” (Ord. 2016-21 § 1, eff. 10/20/16; Ord. 2009-03, eff. 3/5/09; Ord. 88-12 § 1, eff. 7/21/88)

 

Section 5-7.02. Findings and purpose.
The City Council does hereby find that:

Scientific studies have concluded that cigarette smoking causes chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer of the lungs, larynx, esophagus, mouth, and bladder, and contributes to cancer of the cervix, pancreas, and kidneys; and

More than 440,000 people die in the United States from tobacco-related diseases every year, making it the nation’s leading cause of preventable death; and

The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, tobacco will account for 10 million deaths per year, making it the greatest cause of death worldwide; and

The United States Surgeon General has concluded that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke and neither separating smokers from nonsmokers nor installing ventilation systems effectively eliminates secondhand smoke; and

The United States Environmental Protection Agency has found secondhand smoke to be a risk to public health, and has classified secondhand smoke as a group A carcinogen, the most dangerous class of carcinogen; and

The California Air Resources Board has put secondhand smoke in the same category as the most toxic automotive and industrial air pollutants by categorizing it as a toxic air contaminant; and

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has included secondhand smoke on the Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm; and

Exposure to secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in this country, killing over 52,000 non-smokers each year, including 3,000 deaths from lung cancer; and

Secondhand smoke exposure adversely affects fetal growth with elevated risk of low birth weight, and increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in infants of mothers who smoke; and

Secondhand smoke exposure causes as many as 300,000 children in the United States to suffer from lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, exacerbates childhood asthma, and increases the risk of acute chronic middle ear infection in children; and

The total cost of smoking in California was estimated to be $475 per resident or $3,331 per smoker per year, for a total of nearly $15.8 billion in smoking-related costs in 1999 alone; and

The medical and economic costs to nonsmokers suffering from lung cancer or heart disease caused by secondhand smoke are nearly $6 billion per year in the United States;

Almost 90% of adult smokers started smoking at or before age 18; and

It is estimated that in 2006, 15.4% of California secondary students smoked and that the smoking rate was 16.8% for the same group in Santa Barbara County; and

With certain exceptions, Labor Code §6404.5 now prohibits smoking inside an enclosed place of employment; and

Various sections of State law prohibit public school students from smoking or using tobacco; among these are laws prohibiting these students from smoking or using products while on campus, while attending school-sponsored activities, or while under the supervision or control of school district employees; and

State law prohibits smoking in playgrounds and tot lots and restricts smoking within specified distances of the main entrances and exits of public buildings, while expressly authorizing local communities to enact additional restrictions; and

It is the intent of the City Council in enacting this ordinance to provide for the public health, safety, and welfare by discouraging the inherently dangerous behavior of tobacco use around non-tobacco users; by protecting adults and children from exposure to smoking and tobacco while they work and play; by reducing the potential for children to associate smoking and tobacco with a healthy lifestyle; by protecting the public from smoking and tobacco-related litter and pollution; and by affirming and promoting the family atmosphere of the City’s public places. It is expressly not the intent of the City Council in this ordinance to duplicate what is already prohibited by state or federal law, but rather to fill in regulatory gaps as permitted by state and federal regulation.

(b)  For the purpose of this section, diversion of the offending violator to a community service program or a plea bargain to a lesser offence shall constitute a conviction. No public employee or officials whose duty it is to investigate or to enforce the law, or their spouses, children or parents living in the same household shall be entitled to a reward.

(c)   Claims for the rewards under this section shall be filed with the City of Santa Maria Police Department. Each claim shall specifically identify the date, location, kind of property damage, and the name of the person who was convicted or arrested.

(1)  Between the hours of six (6:00) p.m. and seven (7:00) a.m., it is unlawful for any person to sell, display or disperse, or permit or authorize the sale, display, or dispersal of any food, beverage or other product from a catering vehicle.

(3)  No catering vehicle may park for a period exceeding thirty (30) minutes in one location. After each parking period, regardless of length, the vehicle shall be removed from that location and at least two (2) hours shall pass before that or any other catering vehicle of (i.e., operating under permit(s) issued to) that business may return to that location.

(b)  Regulation of Catering Vehicles on Private Property. It is unlawful to sell, display, disperse, or permit or authorize the sale, display or dispersal of any food, beverage or other product from a catering vehicle (as defined in this title), parked on private property, unless all of the following requirements are met:

(1)  The seller has first obtained the written consent of the owners and tenants; and

(2)  The parking period in one location does not exceed seventy (70) minutes.

For purposes of this section, “one location” means the area described by one street address, or the area described by a circle with a radius of three hundred (300) feet, with its center being the catering vehicle at its parking place, whichever is greater.

Compliance with this section shall not excuse compliance with any and all other applicable provisions of this Code, including, but not limited to, laws relating to licensing, permits and zoning. Violation of this section is punishable as a misdemeanor. (Ord. 2008-01, eff. 3/20/08; Ord. 96-14, eff. 10/17/96; Ord. 94-2, eff. 3/3/94, renumbered 7-5.04)

 

Section 7-5.04.1. Parking of Vehicles for Sale.
(a)   In order to prevent traffic congestion, public safety hazards, and parking problems, and to protect the public health, safety and welfare, it is necessary to regulate vehicles which are parked within the City for the purpose of advertising or displaying the vehicle for sale.

(b)  As used herein, the term “vehicle” includes, but is not limited to, “recreational vehicles” as defined in Section 12-2.122 of this Code.

(c)   By authority of State law (see Streets & Highway Code Section 731), no vehicle shall be parked wholly or partly on State Highway 135 or State Highway 166 for the purpose of selling the vehicle. This State law shall prevail notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

(d)  It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle on a public street for more than two (2) hours, or to permit any vehicle owned or controlled by such person to be so parked, when a purpose of such parking is to display, advertise, offer for sale, or sell the vehicle, unless one or more of the following exceptions apply:

(1)  The vehicle is parked on the street frontage directly contiguous to the personal residence of the vehicle owner, as reflected on the registration records of the vehicle. This exception is limited to one (1) vehicle per owner, and only applies to the personal residence of an individual owner; or,

(2)  The vehicle is parked on the street frontage directly contiguous to the vehicle owner’s principal place of employment. This exception does not apply where the employer is in the business of buying, selling or leasing vehicles.

If the parking location of a vehicle is moved from one non-exempt location to another non-exempt location, within a five hundred (500) foot radius, in less than two (2) hours, time shall run consecutively from the initial parking of the vehicle in the first non-exempt location, and shall not be extended, enlarged, or interrupted by any time spent driving or moving the vehicle.

(e)   In addition to the restrictions contained in subsection (d) above, the City Engineer may further restrict or prohibit the parking of vehicles for sale on public streets by posting the area as a “no parking of vehicles for sale” zone upon making the following findings:

(1)  That the restrictions contained in subsection (d) above do not adequately prevent the traffic congestion, public safety hazards, and/or parking problems associated with the parking of vehicles for sale at the location in question; and,

(2)  That the parking of vehicles at this location significantly interferes with the flow of traffic or with vehicular or pedestrian safety; and,

(3)  That there are a reasonable amount of public streets in the City which are not designated as a “no parking of vehicles for sale” zone to provide vehicle owners with other locations to display their vehicles for sale under the conditions set forth in subsection (d).

(f)   It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle on private property not owned or legally possessed by such person or to permit any vehicle owned or controlled by such person to be so parked, when a purpose of such parking is to display, advertise, offer for sale, or sell the vehicle, unless the written consent of the owner, lessee or authorized representative of the property has first been obtained, as follows:

(1)  The written consent shall specify the location where the vehicle may be parked, the date(s) on which the vehicle can be parked, and the license number of the vehicle; and

(2)  The written consent shall be displayed in the vehicle so as to be visible from the outside of the vehicle, and shall be signed by the owner, lessee or authorized representative of the property. Regardless of the owner’s consent, the parking of vehicles for sale on the property must be consistent with the local zoning ordinances and regulations governing the property.

(g)   In addition to whatever other remedies may be available under this Code, vehicles parked on public streets in violation of this section may be removed from the public street by the Police Department pursuant to the procedures set forth in Vehicle Code Section 22651.9.

(h)  For purposes of this section, a vehicle will be deemed parked for the purpose to display, advertise, offer for sale, or sell the vehicle when the parked vehicle displays a sign or other marking which indicates that the vehicle is for sale or lease. (Ord. 98-2, eff. 05/07/98)

The report may include but shall not be limited to such matters as compatibility with the General Plan, general public interest, zoning, traffic or other problems which may appear to be affected by or created by the proposed designation.

(b)  No action shall be taken by the Landmark Committee within less than five (5) days following the receipt of the report from the Planning Commission. Following any action recommending the designation of any place, site, building, structure, work of art or other object as an historical landmark, the report and recommendation of the Landmark Committee shall be forwarded to the City Council, which shall thereafter set the public hearing thereon as provided in this chapter. The report of the Planning Commission shall be forwarded to the City Council, together with any report or recommendation by the Landmark Committee. (Ord. 88-18 § 5, eff. 10/20/88; Ord. 2001-24, effective 1/18/02)

 

Section 8-3.06. Standards for designation and for removal of designation.
In designating or removing from designation any place, site, building, structure, work of art or other object as being of historical, cultural, aesthetic or other special character or interest, and worthy of protection under this chapter, the Landmark Committee and the City Council shall be subject to the following express standards:

(a)   The landmark designated shall have historical, cultural, aesthetic or special character or interest for the general public and not be limited only in interest to a special group of persons, and be at least fifty (50) years of age.

(b)  The designation of such as a landmark under this chapter shall not be detrimental to the general welfare of the community.

(c)   The designation of such landmark shall not require the expenditure of an unreasonable amount of money to carry out the purposes of this chapter. In applying this provision it is the intent of this chapter that whenever a landmark proposed to be so designated is private property, expenditures for its upkeep, preservation, maintenance and protection shall be made by the owner thereof in all but the most exceptional cases. If upon careful review by the Landmark Committee it is proposed that public funds be expended for the preservation, restoration, maintenance or protection thereof, or any other purpose in connection with the designation, the recommendation made by the committee to the City Council shall set forth that fact, and shall set forth in full the reasons therefor, and shall include a statement setting forth as accurately as possible the estimated cost in public funds which would be so involved. The City Council in acting upon the proposed designation shall also determine whether the expenditure of public funds in connection therewith is justified. In the event that such designation would be ineffective for the preservation, restoration or protection of the proposed landmark, without such expenditure, and the City Council determines that the expenditure is not justified, the place, site, building, structure, work of art or other object which is the subject of the proposal shall not be designated an historical landmark.

(d)  The designation of such landmark shall not infringe upon the right of a private owner thereof, if there is such, to make any and all reasonable uses of such landmark which are not in conflict with the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 88-18 § 5, eff. 10/20/88; Ord. 2001-24, effective 1/18/02)

 

Section 8-3.07. Agreement respecting landmark status.
(a)   Upon receipt of the Planning Commission report, if it appears that place, site, building, structure, work of art or other object within the incorporated limits of the City should be designated as a historical landmark, the Landmark Committee shall work with the property owner and lienholders to draft and enter into an acceptable agreement respecting designation. The Committee shall use the guidelines in section 8-3.08 as appropriate in the agreement. Any such agreement shall be effective for ninety (90) days or until the City Council acts on the Committee’s recommendation, whichever occurs sooner. If no agreement is reached, or the City Council does not affirm the agreement, the landmark designation application shall be terminated.

(b)  The City Council may set a public hearing to be advertised once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing. In all cases where private property is the subject of the hearing, notice of the hearing shall be served by mail upon the property owner and lienholders of record of the property at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the hearing. The City Council may consider the recommendation of the Landmark Committee without setting a public hearing and advertising the same in a newspaper of general circulation, if in its discretion the City Council considers the recommended agreement will not create impacts so as to justify that procedure. In any case, however, the City Council, before acting on the recommended agreement, shall give notice to the owner and lienholders of record of the subject property as provided in this section. After such hearing the City Council may affirm the existing agreement, enter into a modified agreement or decline to approve an agreement respecting designation. The action of the City Council shall be final and shall take effect immediately. (Ord. 88-18 § 5, eff. 10/20/88; Ord. 2001-24, effective 1/18/02)

 

Section 8-3.08. Guidelines.
In developing an agreement respecting a historical landmark, the Landmark Committee and City Council shall use the following guidelines, as appropriate:

(a)   The agreement may require the owner or lienholder to provide written notice to the Landmark Committee in advance of structural alteration, demolition, removal or destruction, either in whole or in part, of the landmark. Upon receipt of this notice, the Landmark Committee may schedule a meeting with the owner and lienholder and use the procedures in this chapter to determine whether or not landmark status shall be continued;

(b)  Any agreement may provide that no permits shall be issued by any City department for any alterations, repairs, additions or changes, other than normal maintenance and repair work, unless and until all plans therefor have first been reviewed by the Landmark Committee and approved, or approved as modified, and such reasonable conditions may be imposed as deemed necessary. All such work shall be done under the direction and control of the Landmark Committee or other qualified persons designated by it for such purpose; provided, that conditions imposed as a condition of approval of alterations, repairs, additions or changes shall be final when imposed by the Landmark Committee, and unless they affect conditions imposed by the Council need not be reported to or reviewed by the City Council as provided in Section 8-3.06;

(c)   The agreement may provide that only certain specified uses may be made or that certain specified uses shall be prohibited;

(d)  The agreement may provide that no buildings or structures exposed to public view within a specified distance may be placed, erected, moved, altered, enlarged or removed, other than normal maintenance and repair work, without approval and in accordance with reasonable conditions imposed where deemed necessary by the Landmark Committee;

(e)   The agreement may provide that if the landmark to be designated is a building, that the building shall be open to the public at such reasonable times and intervals as shall be determined by the Landmark Committee;

(f)   The agreement may contain any other reasonable requirements, restrictions or conditions deemed necessary by the Landmark Committee, the owner and the lienholder to meet special or unique circumstances affecting the subject place, site, building, structure, work of art or other object.

(g)   The agreement may provide for disclosure of landmark status upon sale of the property by requiring a copy of the agreement to be provided to the buyer and lienholder. (Ord. 88-18 § 5, eff. 10/20/88; Ord. 2001-24, effective 1/18/02; Ord. 2008-01, eff. 3/20/08; Ord. 2009-03, eff. 3/5/09)

 

Section 8-3.09. Funding petitions.
The Landmark Committee, or other interested persons, may petition the City Council for funds necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. The City Council may expend all reasonable sums needed to carry out the purposes of this chapter or to acquire fee title or such lesser ownership rights, or easements, as it deems necessary or expedient to carry out the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 88-18 § 5, eff. 10/20/88; Ord. 2001-24, effective 1/18/02)

 

Section 8-3.10. Appeals.
(a)   Any person may appeal in writing to the City Council from any action of the Landmark Committee by filing notice of such appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days from the date of such action, and the City Council shall set a public hearing, notice of which shall be duly advertised once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, at least ten (10) days before the date of such hearing to consider such appeal. In all cases where private property is the subject of the action which is appealed from, notice of the hearing shall be served by mail upon the owner and lienholders of record of the property at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the public hearing. At the hearing the City Council may confirm, modify or set aside any or all such actions of the Landmark Committee. (Ord. 88-18 § 5, eff. 10/20/88; Ord. 2001-24, effective 1/18/02)

 

Section 8-3.11. Remedies.
When the Landmark Committee receives information that a designated landmark has been or will be wholly or partially demolished, structurally altered, removed, destroyed, or otherwise no longer meets or will meet the standards set out in Section 8-3-06, the Committee may initiate an application for removal of the designation, using the procedures in the chapter. The Committee may also make any appropriate recommendations respecting continuance or discontinuance of the landmark designation to the Planning Commission.

CHAPTER 8-5  PIPELINE-EXTENSION BENEFIT AREAS
Section 8-5.01. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to accomplish equity in the charges for sewer and water services provided throughout the City, in that at the present time new development pays the cost of construction of the sewer and water lines to serve that development, and older developments have done the same, but from time to time the provision of water and sewer services to all developed and developing areas in the City has necessitated the construction of major water and sewer lines to and through undeveloped areas on the City’s own initiative and the City’s expense which, if not reimbursed upon development, would constitute an additional burden upon taxpayers throughout the City, and an unwarranted benefit to developers, subsequently making connection and receiving the benefit of such sewer and water lines. This chapter therefore provides for the establishment, by recorded resolution and map, of areas of benefit in such areas of the City as the circumstances may apply, providing for reimbursement to the City, by future connectors receiving the benefits of such sewer and water lines, of appropriate pro rata charges, thereby lessening the burden upon City taxpayers and avoiding an unwarranted benefit to such developers. (Prior Code § 20A-1)

 

Section 8-5.02. Establishment request.
In any case where the City initiates and accomplishes through the use of public funds the construction of a major water line or sewer line, the completing of which will substantially benefit undeveloped or underdeveloped properties, the Director of Utilities shall transmit to the City Manager for placement upon the agenda of the Council a request for a resolution establishing an area of benefit served by such sewer or water line, and providing for appropriate charges for future connectors thereto on an equitable pro rata basis. (Prior Code § 20A-2; Ord. 2005-01, eff. 3/3/05)

 

Section 8-5.03. Public hearing.
The Council shall consider the request at a public hearing and hear any and all protests to the proposed areas of benefit and proposed reimbursement charges, and shall then adopt a resolution implementing the request, modifying it or rejecting it. (Prior Code § 20A-3)

 

Section 8-5.04. Recording of resolution.
The resolution referred to in Section 8-5.03, as adopted, which shall include a schedule of charges, together with an appended map of the area of benefit, shall be certified by the City Clerk and recorded in the office of the county Clerk-Recorder. (Prior Code § 20A-4)

 

Section 8-5.05. Reimbursement required for development.
From and after the date of adoption of the resolution provided for in this chapter by the Council, in the case of any development of property within the area of benefit, such reimbursement shall be required as a condition of subdivision within such area. In any event, the building official shall require the payment by the developer of the pro rata fee prescribed in the development as a condition of, and prior to, the issuance of a building permit for the property; provided, that payment of the reimbursement shall be credited against the applicable charge required by the building official. (Prior Code § 20A-5)

CHAPTER 8-6  SIDEWALK AND STREET-EDGE MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT

CHAPTER 8-9  WATER MAIN EXTENSION BENEFIT DISTRICTS
Section 8-9.01. Purpose: Qualifications.
(a)   When in connection with a development, it is necessary either (1) to install water main extensions off the site of the development, (2) to extend oversized water mains on the site of the development, or (3) to install water main extensions on the site of the development in a location such that the main or mains will be of benefit to adjacent properties not owned by the developer, a benefit district incorporating the area which may be served from the main or mains and thereby be benefited, as determined by the Director of Public Works, may be established and administered as provided in this chapter. The benefit district will be for the purpose of securing reimbursement of a portion of the applicant’s installation costs for the main extension from subsequent users. Oversize water mains are defined to be water main of ten (10) inch diameter or larger within nonresidential land use areas.

(b)  The purpose of this procedure is to provide developers with a method for securing reimbursement for water main extensions of benefit to independently owned properties. It is not intended that benefit districts be created where financial equity is possible through private negotiations between the developer and either the original owners of the development parcel or subsequent purchasers of a portion of the development. (Prior Code § 20-48.4(A))

 

Section 8-9.02. Guidelines and standards.
The Director of Public Works shall develop guidelines and standards for the administration of the water main benefit extension district procedure consistent with the provisions of this chapter. (Prior Code § 20-48.4(B))

 

Section 8-9.03. Application: Initiation: Contents.
(a)   Application for the creation of a benefit district shall be made to the Director of Public Works prior to acceptance of the subject public improvement as complete by the City. In the event the City installs and finances a main extension, the Director of Public Works may initiate the creation of a benefit district.

(b)  The applicant shall supply the Director of Public Works with the necessary improvement plans, benefit district boundary map, technical data, verifiable cost records and other supporting information as he may require to process the application and to administer the benefit district provisions. (Prior Code § 20-48.4(B))

 

Section 8-9.04. Application: Filing.
Application for a water extension benefit district can be made at the office of the Director of Public Works. After approval of the application by the Director of Public Works, he shall transmit the benefit district map and appropriate supporting data to the City Clerk and the City Clerk will file the benefit district map and appropriate supporting data with the county recorder at which time the district will be effective. An information copy shall also be filed with the Director of Finance and with the Director of Community Development. (Prior Code § 20-48.4(C); Ord. 2017-01 § 62, eff. 3/9/17)

 

Section 8-9.05. Payment of reimbursement fee.
Any individual connecting to a water main which is the subject of a benefit district will pay the reimbursement fee established by the benefit district to the Director of Finance at the time of applying for service, and in any case before making the connection. (Prior Code § 20-48.4(D); Ord. 2017-01 § 63, eff. 3/9/17)

 

Section 8-9.06. Expiration.
(a)   A water main extension benefit district will automatically expire on the fifteenth anniversary of the date the district is filed with the county recorder. Any connections to the public facilities after the expiration date will be at no reimbursement cost to the connector.

(b)  A report of the financial status of the benefit district will be prepared by the Director of Finance and mailed to the applicant at his last known address. Upon his request, any funds due him will be tendered. If there is no response from the applicant within six (6) months of the final report to him, any funds due him will be deemed forfeited and these amounts plus any surplus revenues in the account of the particular benefit district will be transferred to the municipal waterworks fund. (Prior Code § 20-48.4(E); Ord. 2017-01 § 64, eff. 3/9/17)

CHAPTER 8-10  WATER SERVICE
Section 8-10.01. Waterworks fund.

CHAPTER 8-14  DRAINAGE FEES
Section 8-14.01. North Blosser Road area and Battles Road area drainage fee.
(a)   There is re-established a fee to defray actual or estimated costs of building planned drainage facilities that will remove surface and storm waters from certain local drainage areas known as the North Blosser Road drainage area and the Battles Road drainage area.

(b)  This fee requirement was initiated in Ordinance No. 441 of the Santa Maria City Council, in which the following findings were made and actions taken, each of which is confirmed:

(1)  The master drainage report of the City Engineer of the City, dated February, 1960 was adopted as the drainage element of the General Plan;

(2)  Subdivision and development in drainage areas shown in the report was found to require construction of identified drainage facilities:

(3)  Per the master drainage report, the North Blosser Road area facility was found to cost an estimated one hundred ninety-one thousand nine hundred thirty-nine dollars ($191,939.00) and the Battles Road facility an estimated forty-three thousand five hundred seventy-eight dollars ($43,578.00), in 1960 dollars, those facilities being in addition to existing local facilities serving the area;

(4)  The County of Santa Barbara was found to have no county-wide general drainage plan.

(c)   Unless otherwise required by State law, drainage fees shall be payable, in cash or other consideration of equal value acceptable to the City Attorney, upon approval of a final subdivision map in either of the described areas. Fees shall be a per-acre-or-fraction-thereof charge, calculated as follows:

(1)  The total area of undeveloped land within said planned local drainage area shall be added to the total area of undeveloped land within said drainage area which is zoned for commercial, industrial or planned community development or shown on the City’s General Plan as planned for commercial or industrial development. This total shall then be divided into the total estimated cost of construction of new facilities to serve said planned local drainage facilities and the resultant figure shall be termed the “unit of drainage cost.”

(2)  The fee for the subdivision of each acre of land for residential use shall be one unit of drainage cost. The fee for subdivision of each acre for commercial, industrial and planned community use shall be two units. The terms “residential,” “industrial,” “commercial” and “planned community” use shall mean the same as they are defined in Ordinance No. 360 of the City.

(3)  Notwithstanding anything else herein contained, said fee shall not exceed an amount equal to the pro rata share of the amount of the total, actual or estimated costs of all facilities, existing or planned, within the local drainage area which would be assessable to such subdivision if such costs were apportioned uniformly on a per-acre basis.

(d)  Revenues raised by payment of drainage area and fees shall be placed in a separate account. These revenues, and any interest on them shall be used only to:

(1)  Pay for the City’s construction of facilities described in the master drainage report dated February, 1960, and any updates thereto, or to reimburse the City for those facilities built by the City with funds it advanced from other services; or

(2)  Reimburse developers who have been required or authorized to install such facilities whose cost exceeds their drainage fee obligation under this section.

(e)   Cost estimates in the master drainage report shall be adjusted once yearly by resolution of the City Council to reflect the increase or decrease of construction costs, on the basis of a factor recommended by the Director of Public Works, which factor shall be based on the Engineering News Record Cost of Construction Index published by McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. Prior to adjusting the fee, notice shall be given in conformity with Section 2-24.101 et seq. of Title 2 of this Code. (Res. 90-143 § 4, eff. 10/16/90; Ord. 88-22 § 2 (c), eff. 1/5/88)

(a)   There is established a fee to defray estimated costs of building the storm drainage projects identified by the Orcutt Drainage Plan (June, 1960), as modified by the supplement (September, 1964).

(b)  The fee shall be paid by the developer of original construction or subdivider of property, whose property is located within the City limits, the planned local drainage area and all of the area within the watershed served by the Orcutt Area Drainage Element of the Santa Barbara County General Plan. A map designating this area is on file in the Engineering Division of the Public Works Department, and is incorporated by reference into the ordinance codified in this section.

(c)   The fee shall be paid at the earliest time allowed by State law, in the following amounts:

(1)  One hundred dollars ($100) per residential lot;

(2)  Five hundred dollars ($500) per acre or fraction thereof for property to be developed as commercial, industrial, school, church, shopping center or other similar uses which substantially cover the ground or which decrease the permeability of the soil; or

(3)  One hundred dollars ($100) per acre or fraction thereof for property to be developed as park, golf course, green belt, agricultural or other similar uses which substantially preserve the permeability of the soil.

(d)  The drainage facilities planned in the Plan and supplement were in addition to existing local drainage facilities serving the area at the time the Plan was adopted.

(e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the fee established by this section shall not exceed an amount equal to the pro rata share of estimated costs of all planned facilities located in the area covered by the Plan.

(f)   This section shall not apply where building permits are issued for alterations or additions to existing buildings or structures. If a developer contributes cash or other valuable consideration toward the construction of the facilities identified in the Plan or any updates thereto, the developer shall receive credit for the contribution against the fee otherwise to be paid under this section.

(g)   Revenues raised by payment of drainage fees shall be placed in a separate account. These revenues, and any interest on them, shall be used only to:

(1)  Pay for the City’s and/or Santa Barbara County Flood Control District’s construction of facilities described in the Orcutt Drainage Plan dated June 1960 and any updates thereto, or to reimburse these entities for those facilities they built with funds advanced from other sources; or

(2)  Reimburse developers who have been required or authorized to install such facilities whose cost exceeds their drainage fee obligation under this section.

(h)  Cost estimates in the Orcutt Drainage Plan may be adjusted once yearly by resolution of the City Council to reflect the increase or decrease of construction costs, on the basis of a factor recommended by the Director of Public Works and/or director of the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, which factor shall be based on the Engineering News Record Cost of Construction Index published by McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. Before adjusting the fee, notice shall be given in conformity with Section 2-24.101 et seq. of this Code. (Ord. 91-31 § 2, eff. 2/6/92)

Section 8-15.08. Reimbursement Agreements.
(a)   An owner or developer of a parcel/lot or parcels/lots within the City may be considered eligible to enter into a reimbursement agreement with the City to reimburse the owner for the developer’s approved cost of installing or acquiring one or more of the facilities and equipment. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney. In order to qualify for any reimbursement, an applicant has to have constructed infrastructure improvements that meet two criteria: 1) the improvements must be on the adopted growth mitigation capital improvement list; and 2) the improvements must be of a size greater than that required to mitigate the impact of the development. The source of reimbursement may be growth mitigation fees from the same fee component collected in the future. The applicant shall be reimbursed only for those costs incurred over and above growth mitigation fees paid and credited. Unless otherwise agreed to between the parties to the reimbursement agreement, the City’s estimate for the facility, as set forth in the Study, shall be the maximum reimbursement. The facilities and equipment for which reimbursement is provided must be dedicated to the City.

(b)  The City shall not reimburse the owner for any costs related to financing any facilities and equipment, unless the City Council adjusts the growth mitigation fees to accommodate the financing costs.

(c)   Any reimbursement agreement entered into under this section shall require the City to provide reimbursements for a period of up to five (5) years. Reimbursements shall only be provided from the proceeds of the growth mitigation fees collected by the City for the same type of facility for which reimbursement is being made. Until all the facilities and equipment of the same type as the facilities and equipment acquired pursuant to the reimbursement agreement have been constructed or acquired, only twenty-five percent (25%) of the growth mitigation fee proceeds collected by the City for the same type of facility for which the reimbursement is being made shall be paid in reimbursements. The remaining seventy-five percent (75%) shall be held by the City for use to construct and acquire facilities and equipment.

(d)  In the event the City enters into reimbursement agreements with the owners of different parcels which obligate the City to make reimbursement payments at the same time for the same types of facility, the owner which has executed the earliest reimbursement agreement with the City shall be entitled to growth mitigation fee proceeds before any other owner.

(e)   As used in this section, facilities which are of the same “type” are those facilities identified in the same section/fee component of the Study.

(f)   All reimbursements under this section shall be provided on an annual basis at the time determined by the City.

(g)   None of the provisions in this section shall affect reimbursement maps which were previously recorded. (Ord. 93-10, eff. 09/04/93)

(b)  Any applicant subject to a growth mitigation fee imposed pursuant to this chapter, who is redeveloping a lot or parcel which has been improved and the existing structures have been used to house a residence or business duly licensed to operate in the City of Santa Maria within the fifty (50) years preceding the adoption date of this chapter, may be eligible for a credit against the fee otherwise due.

(c)   Eligibility for, and the amount of, the credit shall be determined by the City Engineer, based on adopted City standards and procedures including, but not limited to, whether the dedication, construction or contribution meets capital improvement needs for which the particular growth mitigation fee has been imposed, as provided in this chapter and the Capital Improvement Plan, applicable Master Plan, or the Growth Mitigation Fee Program dated April, 1993; whether the dedication, construction or contribution will substitute for or otherwise reduce the need for, or cost of, capital improvements anticipated to be provided with growth mitigation fee funds; the value of the dedication, construction or contribution; or in the case of redevelopment, a credit amount for an existing or previously existing use can be calculated as a part of a suitable mitigation study prepared by an appropriate design professional in conformance with guidelines established by and subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. Any request for a credit must be made in writing by the applicant to the City Engineer prior to the Planning Commission’s consideration of the project. Credit shall be based upon the value of the improvement as established in the growth mitigation capital improvement list. In no event, however, shall the credit exceed the amount of the otherwise applicable growth mitigation fee.

(B)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

(C)    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or

(D)    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

(20)    “Lowest floor” means the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s “lowest floor,” provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.

(21)    “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.

(22)    “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent.

(23)    “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

(24)    “New construction” means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by this community.

(24A) “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after June 21, 1988.

(25)    “One hundred (100) year flood” means a flood which has a one percent (1%) annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the “base flood,” which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

(26)    “Person” means an individual or his agent, firm, partnership, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this State or its agencies or political subdivisions.

(27)    “Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

(28)    “Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

(29)    “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area having special flood or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99 or AH.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

(31)    “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

(31A) “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

(32)    “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either:

(A)    Before the improvement or repair is started; or

(B)    If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:

(A)    Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

(B)    Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State inventory of historic places.

(33)    “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

(34)    “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Section 9-68.106. Lands to which this chapter applies.
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards within the jurisdiction of the City. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

 

Section 9-68.107. Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Santa Maria,” dated July 15, 1988, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study is on file at the City Community Development Department, 110 South Pine, and the Public Works Department, 810 West Church Street, Santa Maria, California, 93458. This flood insurance study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the floodplain administrator. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 2016-05 § 20, eff. 3/2/16; Ord. 2003-02, eff. 3/6/03; Ord. 2002-05, eff. 7/18/02; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

 

Section 9-68.108. Compliance.
No structure or land shall be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to so comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Section 9-68.109. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

Section 9-68.110. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

(a)   Considered as minimum requirements;

(b)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

 

Section 9-68.111. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee of the City, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made under this chapter. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

 

Section 9-68.112. Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

(b)  Be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement in accordance with the provisions of FEMA Manual No. 85. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

 

Section 9-68.305. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 9-68.107 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(a)   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, are prohibited, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(b)  If Section 9-68.303(a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

 

Section 9-68.306. Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas.
(a)   The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction or other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area.

(b)  Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed development is reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination including but are not limited to:

(1)  The type and quality of soils;

(Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 2016-05 § 22, eff. 3/2/16)

 

Article 4. Variance Procedure
Section 9-68.401. Appeal board.
(a)   The board of appeals of the City shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

(b)  The board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

(c)   In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:

(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(6)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the General Plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(10)        The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;

(11)        The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair to public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.

(d)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (1) through (11) in subsection (c) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(e)   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (c) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(f)   The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 2019-10, eff. 1/1/20; Ord. 88-13 § 2, eff. 6/21/88)

 

Section 9-68.402. Conditions for variances.
(a)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.

(b)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(d)  Variances shall be issued upon:

(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(2)  A determination that failure to grant the ordinance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(e)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections (a) through (d) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

Section 11-6.06. Dedications and Easements.
(a)   Dedications.

All dedications or offers of dedication to the City or a governmental agency shall be made by certificate on the final map or parcel map. However, for parcel maps, dedications or offers thereof may be made by separate document recorded prior to or concurrently with the recordation of the parcel map. (Reference: Government Code Section 66439).

(b)  Off-site Easements.

(1)  Written evidence shall be submitted of rights-of-entry or permanent easements on or across private property not within the proposed subdivision as may be necessary to allow performance of the work necessary to improve the subdivision, to allow for maintenance of the subdivision improvements once completed, to allow for permanent public access to the proposed subdivision, or to allow for and to grant necessary slope rights. This evidence shall be submitted prior to recordation of the map.

(2)  In the event impacts are created which would adversely affect adjacent or downstream parcels as a result of the design of the subdivision, the City may require the submission of deeds, easements, or rights-of-way not within the proposed subdivision which are necessary to resolve drainage and erosion impacts created by the subdivision. In all cases, real property interests required shall be roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created. When required, this evidence shall be submitted prior to recordation of the map. (Reference: Government Code Section 66462.5).

(c)   Street Rights-Of-Way.

(1)  Subject to the exceptions listed in subsection (2), rights-of-way for public streets shown on the map shall be offered for dedication free and clear of any prior easements or rights-of-way. Similarly, all rights of direct access to or from controlled access roads where such roads abut lots within the proposed subdivision shall be waived or dedicated.

(2)  Exceptions: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the advisory agency, on the advice of the City Engineer, may approve exceptions to subsection (1) upon finding that one or more of the following apply:

(A)  The right-of-way extends through a cross street or other crossing;

(B)  The prior easements or rights-of-way would not conflict with the use of the property offered for dedication as a public street;

(C)  Maintenance or other use of the prior easements of rights-of-way does not have the potential to damage City improvements.

(d)  Park Sites.

All park sites to be dedicated in accordance with Chapter 9 of this title shall be offered for conveyance to the appropriate Public Agency as part of the final or parcel map, or in the case of a parcel map only, by separate document recorded prior to or concurrently with the recordation of the parcel map.

If the agreement and/or final map or parcel map is unacceptable, the City Council shall make its recommended corrections, instruct the City Attorney and/or City Engineer to draft a new agreement and/or revise the final or parcel map, and defer approval until an acceptable agreement and/or final or parcel map has been resubmitted.

(b)  Parcel Map Exception.

City Council action is not required for parcel maps that do not require a subdivision improvement agreement because the installation of public improvements is not required or the public improvements are already installed. These parcel maps are processed pursuant to Section 11-6.07 of this chapter.

(c)   City Council Denial.

(1)  The City Council shall deny approval of a final or parcel map upon making a finding that it does not comply with the requirements of Section 11-3.03(f) of this title or for failure to substantially meet and perform requirements or conditions which were applicable to the subdivision at the time of approval of the official tentative map. The disapproval for failure to conform to an official tentative map shall be accompanied by a finding identifying the requirements or conditions which have not been met or performed.

(2)  Where it appears that the failure of the map to meet any requirement or condition is a result of a technical and inadvertent error which, in the determination of the City Council, does not materially affect the validity of the map, the map may be approved. (Reference: Government Code Section 66473).

(d)  Condominiums, Community Apartments, Stock Cooperatives.

Final or parcel maps for condominiums, community apartment projects, and stock cooperative apartment projects shall not be approved unless the City Council finds that the notices required by Section 66427.1 of the Subdivision Map Act have been given to the tenants of the proposed project.

(3)  Improvement plans shall include, but not be limited to, all improvements required pursuant to Section 11-8.04 of this chapter.

(b)  Form.

All improvement plans shall have the following format. The final format of all improvement plans shall be approved by the City Engineer.

(1)  Plans, profiles, and details shall be legibly drawn, or reproduced by a process which results in a reproducible drawing, on twenty-two (22) inch by thirty-four (34) inch sheets. A border shall be made on each sheet providing one-half (1/2) inch at the top, bottom, and right side, and one and one-half (1 1/2) inches on the left side.

(2)  A City standard title block shall be placed in the lower right corner of the main field of each sheet.

(3)  Plans and profiles shall be drawn to the scale of one (1) inch equals forty (40) feet or larger unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. Details shall be drawn to scale that clearly shows the facility being constructed. The scales for various portions of the plans shall be shown on each sheet.

(4)  A vicinity map shall be shown on the first sheet of all sets of plans.

(5)  A north arrow shall be shown on each sheet when applicable.

(6)  Plans shall be laid out to orient north to the top or right edge of the sheet unless approved otherwise by the City Engineer.

(7)  The minimum size of all lettering shall be one-eighth (1/8) inch (nominal) and all lettering shall be legible when reduced.

(8)  If the plans include five (5) or more sheets, a key map showing the sheets and the area covered by each sheet of the plan shall be included on the first sheet of the plans.

(c)   Content.

The improvement plans shall show complete plans, profiles, and details for all required improvements to be constructed, both public and private, including common areas.

(e)   Cost Estimates.

A preliminary estimate of the cost of the public improvements associated with the proposed subdivision shall be prepared by the subdivider’s engineer pursuant to Section 11-8.06 of this chapter, and shall accompany the improvement plans at the time they are submitted to the City Engineer. Cost estimates shall include a separate item for contingencies in the amount of ten (10) percent of the estimated actual cost. The estimate submitted by the subdivider’s engineer shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. The approved preliminary estimate shall be utilized for the purposes of establishing public improvement plan checking fee. An approved final estimate shall be used to establish construction inspection fees, to reconcile the plan checking fee previously charged (based on the preliminary estimate) with the fees as they would be based upon the more accurate final estimate, and for establishing required amounts of security as required by Section 11-8.06 of this chapter.

(f)   Review by the City Engineer and Responsible Agencies.

(1)  The subdivider shall submit the improvement plans and all supporting material to the City Engineer for review by the City and all responsible agencies, such as the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, within whose legal jurisdiction the improvements set forth on the plans are proposed to be constructed.

(2)  Improvement plans shall be acted on within sixty (60) working days of their submittal, except that at least fifteen (15) working days shall be provided for processing any resubmitted improvement plans. The sixty (60) working day period shall not include any days during which the improvement plans have been returned to the applicant for correction, have been subject to review by agencies or entities other than the City of Santa Maria, or following that review, have been returned to the applicant for correction. These time limits may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the City Council. However, the City Council may not require a routine waiver of time limits as a condition of accepting the improvement plans. A routine waiver may be obtained for the purpose of permitting concurrent processing of other requirements related to the improvement plans or map. (Reference: Government Code Section 66456.2).

(g)   Approval by the City Engineer.

(1)  After completing any required revisions, the subdivider shall transmit the originals of the improvement plans to the City Engineer for signature. All revisions shall be legibly drawn on the plans; “sticky back” corrections are not allowed.

(2)  Upon a finding that all required revisions have been made and that the plans conform to all applicable City ordinances and plans, design standards and specifications, and the conditions of official tentative map approval, the City Engineer shall sign and date the plans. The signed original plans shall remain on file in the office of the City Engineer. Copies of the plans may be made by the subdivider for the subdivider’s use.

(3)  Approval of the improvement plans shall not be construed as approval of the gas, electric, telephone, or cable television service construction plans.

(4)  Approval by the City Engineer shall in no way relieve the subdivider or the subdivider’s engineer from responsibility for the design of the improvements and for any deficiencies resulting from the design, or from any required conditions of official tentative map approval.

(h)  Plan Checking and Inspection Costs.

The actual, reasonable cost incurred by the City for the checking of plans and calculations, and all necessary inspections, shall be paid by the subdivider in accordance with the most current fee schedule adopted by the City Council.

(i)   Revisions to Approved Plans.

(1)  By Subdivider. Requests by the subdivider for major revisions to the approved plans appearing necessary or desirable during construction shall be submitted in writing to the City Engineer. The request shall be accompanied by copies of revised drawings that show the proposed revision prepared by the subdivider’s engineer who prepared, signed, and stamped the original drawings. If the revision is acceptable to the City Engineer and consistent with the official tentative map, the originals of the revised drawings shall be submitted to the City Engineer for initialing. The originals of the revised and initialed drawings shall remain on file in the office of the City Engineer. Construction of any proposed revision shall not be permitted to begin until the revised plans have been received and approved by the City Engineer.

(2)  By City Engineer. When revisions to the plans are deemed necessary by the City Engineer to protect the public health and safety, or as field conditions may require, a request in writing shall be made to the subdivider. The subdivider shall revise the plans and transmit the originals to the City Engineer for initialing within the time period specified by the City Engineer.

(3)  Costs for Revisions. Reasonable costs incurred by the City for the checking of plans or calculations or inspections as a result of revisions to the approved plans shall be borne by the subdivider at actual cost. A deposit, when required, shall be submitted with the revised plans and applied toward the cost.

(j)   As-Built Plans.

At the time of completion of the public improvements required pursuant to this title, and as a condition precedent to release of the improvement security, the subdivider shall submit or cause to be submitted to the City Engineer one (1) set of prints and the original tracings of improvement plans which have been modified by the civil engineer of record for the subdivision to reflect the improvements as built.

(a)   Supplemental Capacity - Requirement.

The subdivider may be required to install improvements for the benefit of the subdivision which may contain supplemental size, capacity, or number for the benefit of property not within the subdivision as a condition precedent to the approval of the official tentative map, and thereafter to dedicate such improvements to the public. Supplemental size, capacity, or number shall mean that size, capacity, or number in excess of the minimum standard City requirements for a particular size and type of project. (Reference: Government Code Section 66485).

(b)  Supplemental Capacity - Reimbursement Agreement.

The City shall enter into an agreement for reimbursement to the subdivider of the cost plus interest, at a rate established by City Council, of the supplemental size, capacity, or number. However, the subdivider shall be reimbursed only for that portion of the cost of such improvements actually collected by the City, up to an amount equal to the difference between the amount it would cost the subdivider to install improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of the oversized improvements. (Reference: Government Code Section 66486).

(c)   Supplemental Capacity - Financing.

(1)  To pay for the cost of such a reimbursement, the City Council may at its discretion:

(A)  Contribute to the subdivider that part of the cost of the improvements attributable to the benefit of real property outside the subdivision and thereafter levy a charge upon the real property benefitted thereby to reimburse the City for its cost, plus interest; or

(C)  Establish and maintain local benefit districts for the levy and collection of the charge or costs attributable to the property benefitted by the supplemental capacity, size, or number. (Reference: Government Code Section 66487).

(2)  No such user charge, levy, or local benefit district shall be established unless and until a public hearing is held thereon by the City Council and the City Council finds that the fee or charge and the area of benefit or local benefit district is reasonably related to the cost of such supplemental improvements and the actual ultimate beneficiaries thereof. The public noticing shall include the following:

(A)  Written notice of the hearing shall be given to the subdivider, to those who own property within the proposed area of benefit as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll, and the potential users of the supplemental improvements insofar as they can be ascertained at the time.

(B)  Such notices shall be mailed by the City Clerk at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date established for the hearing.

(3)  If the City has adopted a local drainage or sanitary sewer plan or map as required for the imposition of fees therefor, the City may impose a reasonable charge on property within the area benefitted and may provide for the collection of the charge as set forth in this title. The City may enter into reimbursement agreements with the subdivider who constructs the facilities, and charges collected by the City therefor may be utilized to reimburse the subdivider as set forth in Section 11-8.05(c) of this chapter. (Reference: Government Code Section 66488). (Ord. 94-29, eff. 12/15/94)

The amount of reduction of the security shall be determined by the appropriate department or departments, but in no event shall the department or departments authorize a release of the improvement security which would reduce security to an amount below that required to guarantee the completion of the improvements and any other obligation imposed by the Subdivision Map Act, this title, or the subdivision improvement agreement. (Reference: Government Code Section 66499.7(a)).

(E)  Only subdivision in-lieu fees, as calculated in this chapter, may be required of developments of fifty (50) lots or fewer, except that when a condominium project, stock cooperative, or community apartment exceeds fifty (50) dwelling units, dedication of land may be required notwithstanding that the number of parcels may be less than fifty (50). However, nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in developments of fifty (50) lots or fewer, where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the City.

(2)  The in-lieu fee per acre shall be based on the Citywide average fair market value of land that would be dedicated.

(F)  The location of existing or proposed park sites and recreation trails.

(2)  The determination by the City Council as to whether land shall be dedicated, or the subdivision in-lieu fee shall be charged, or a combination of both, shall be final and conclusive. (Reference: Government Code Section 66477).

(f)   Procedure.

(1)  At the time of approval or conditional approval of the official tentative map, the Planning Commission shall determine, based on recommendations from the Director of Recreation and Parks, whether land, subdivision in-lieu fees, or a combination of both, shall be dedicated and/or paid by the subdivider.

(2)  The Planning Commission may approve, modify, or disapprove the recommendation of the Director of Recreation and Parks.

(3)  The recommendation of the Director of Recreation and Parks shall include the following:

(A)  The amount of land required, or that the subdivision in-lieu fee be charged instead of the dedication, or that a combination of land and fee be required; and

(B)  The location of the park land and, where appropriate, the siting and conceptual design of the park facilities thereto, to be dedicated or used in lieu of fees; and

(C)  The approximate time when the development of the park or recreation facility shall commence in the case of land dedication.

(4)  Where dedication is required, the dedication shall be accomplished in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act and this title, and such land shall be conveyed to the City.

(5)  Where subdivision in-lieu fees are required, they are due and payable to the City at the time of building permit issuance.

(6)  Open space covenants, easements or other appropriate designations for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the City, in a form and type acceptable to the City Attorney and Director of Recreation and Parks, prior to approval of the final or parcel map by the City Council, and shall be recorded as part of the final or parcel map or recorded concurrently as a separate instrument with the final or parcel map.

(g)   Private Parks/Open Space Maintained by Others.

(1)  If private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed development, and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by others, such areas may be credited against not more than sixty percent (60%) of the requirement of dedication and development for park and recreation purposes, as set forth in this chapter, or the payment of the subdivision in-lieu fee thereof, in accordance with Section 11-9.05(f) of this chapter, provided that the following standards are met:

(A)  That yards, court areas, required setbacks and other open space areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building provisions of the City’s Municipal Code shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and

(B)  That the ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for; and

(C)  That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded easements which run with the land in favor of the existing and future owners of property within the development and which cannot be modified or eliminated without the consent of the City Council; and

(D)  That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location of the private open space land; and

(E)  That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the Land Use Element of the City’s General Plan and are approved by the Recreation and Parks Commission; and

(F)  That the quality of all elements of recreation improvements shall meet the guidelines of the U.S. Consumer’s Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

(2)  A minimum of fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet of landscaped space containing recreation facilities may qualify the applicant for credit to a maximum of sixty percent (60%) of the total subdivision in-lieu fee. All recreation facilities shall meet the CPSC Guidelines. The actual amount of credit will be determined by the estimated value of the land as set forth in Section 11-9.05(d) of this chapter, and the cost estimates of the recreation facilities as approved by the Director of Recreation and Parks. These are calculated and available at the Recreation and Parks Department. All recreation facilities proposed for credit shall be approved by the Director of Recreation and Parks prior to approval of the official tentative map.

(3)  Minor deviations from the standards of this section may be approved by the Director of Recreation and Parks, provided the changes are in conformance with the purpose and intent of this chapter.

(4)  If a credit is received under this section, further credit may be given under Section 11-9.05(h), but in no case shall the total credit given under Sections 11-9.05(g) and (h) exceed sixty percent (60%).

(5)  If a credit is received under this section, no credit shall be available pursuant to Chapter 7 of Title 3 of the Municipal Code (Residential Development Tax), or Section 11-9.05(i) of this chapter.

The Recreation and Parks Commission shall determine eligibility for this credit.

(2)  If a credit is received under this section, further credit may be given under Section 11-9.05(g), but in no case shall the total credit given under Sections 11-9.05(g) and (h) exceed sixty percent (60%).

(3)  If a credit is received under this section, no credit shall be available pursuant to Chapter 7 of Title 3 of the Municipal Code (Residential Development Tax), or Section 11-9.05(i) of this chapter.

If the Recreation and Parks Commission finds that a project will be built and operated for Lower Income Tenants, as defined by the latest United States Housing and Urban Development Department figures for the Santa Maria area, the payment of the subdivision in-lieu fee may be deferred according to the following:

(A)  One-half (1/2) of the fee amount shall be paid on or before one (1) year from the date the City issues the last Certificate of Occupancy for the project, with the remainder of the fee due on or before one (1) year thereafter together with interest based on the average interest rate of the Local Agency Investment Fund for the twelve (12) month period (last four statements) ending thirty (30) days prior to the date payment is due.

Approval of the fee deferment shall be through a resolution adopted by the Recreation and Parks Commission.

(2)  Reductions. If the City Council finds that a project will be built and operated for senior citizens, the City Council may, by resolution, approve a credit to a maximum of sixty percent (60%) of the total subdivision in-lieu fee. If the project does not remain as a seniors only project, the remainder of the subdivision in-lieu fee shall be paid. If a reduction is received under this section, no credits or reductions shall be available pursuant to Chapter 7 of Title 3 of the Municipal Code, or Sections 11-9.05(g) and 11-9.05(h) of this chapter. In addition, no credit shall be available pursuant to Municipal Code Section 8-15.19 unless the exemption provisions of Municipal Code Section 8-15.16 apply.

The waiver of all or a portion of the fee will be determined by the Director of Recreation and Parks based on the estimated cost of the on-site recreation facilities. If a reduction is received under this section, no credits or reductions shall be available pursuant to Chapter 7 of Title 3 of the Municipal Code, or Sections 11-9.05(g), 11-9.05(h), or 11-9.05(i)(2) of this chapter.

(d)  Any such application made pursuant to subsection (c) (1) shall contain adequate documentation that the conditions set forth in subsection (c) exist. The Director of Community Development may request such additional documentation, reports and information as he or she deems necessary to evaluate the application. Such information may include:

If land use permits for the change of use are approved, the approving body shall condition such approvals upon specified amendments to the conversion impact report.

(2)  That specified conditions shall be imposed upon the change of use to mitigate adverse impacts upon the ability of displaced homeowners and tenants to find adequate replacement housing in a mobilehome park and to require that reasonable costs of relocation be paid as set forth in this chapter.

(3)  Where an exemption from relocation assistance has been applied for based upon the impact of such assistance upon the reasonable use of the property pursuant to Section 12-9A.106, the approving body shall make one of the following findings:

(A)  That the applicant shall not be exempt from relocation assistance obligations because sufficient evidence has not been shown that the costs of relocation which would otherwise be required by this chapter would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for alternative uses.

(B)  That the applicant or owner shall be exempt from relocation assistance obligations in whole or in part, because he or she has shown sufficient evidence that imposition of such obligations, in whole or in part, would eliminate substantially all reasonable alternate use or economic value of the property.

In making such determination, the approving body may take into account the financial history of the mobilehome park, its condition and the condition of amenities and improvements thereon, the cost of any necessary repairs, improvements or rehabilitation of such park, the estimated costs of relocation, the fair market value of the property for the proposed alternative use, the fair market value of the property for continued use as a mobilehome park, and any other pertinent evidence requested or presented. In rendering its decision, the approving body shall have the power to waive all or portions of any type of benefit which would otherwise be applicable and shall expressly indicate in its decision any such waiver and the extent thereof.

(4)  Where an exemption from relocation assistance has been applied for based upon bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to Section 12-9A.106 (c) (2) the City Council or Planning Commission shall make one of the following findings:

(A)  That the application or project shall be exempt from relocation assistance obligations, in whole or in part, because a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in connection with a proceeding in bankruptcy that the closure or cessation of use of said property as a mobilehome park is necessary, and because such court has taken further action which would prohibit or preclude payment of such benefits, whether in whole or in part. In rendering its decision the City Council shall have the power to waive all or portions of any type of benefit to the extent necessary to comply with the judgement, order, or decree of the court.

The approval of a total exemption from relocation assistance obligations shall have the effect of eliminating the requirement of such portion of the conversion impact report.

CHAPTER 12-24  AA AIRPORT APPROACH DISTRICT
Section 12-24.01. Regulations designated.
The sections of this chapter constitute the AA (airport approach) district combining regulations. (Ord. 84-1077 § 1 (Exhibit B) (B), eff. 11/1/84; Prior Code § 10-87)

 

Section 12-24.02. Intent.
(a)   The AA airport approach zone combining regulations are established in order to minimize the hazard to safe landing and take-off of aircraft using the Santa Maria Public Airport by limiting the height of buildings, accessory structures and uses within the aerial approaches. The AA (airport approach) district shall be depicted on the zoning map by the letters “AA.”

(b)  In any airport approach area subject to AA combining regulations, no structure shall be erected, moved, altered or reconstructed, nor shall any plant or tree be allowed to grow in such a manner that the height thereof, including all super-structures and appurtenances, will exceed the height limits imposed in this chapter. These height limits are necessary in order to reduce to a minimum the hazard to safe landing and take-off of aircraft using the airport. (Ord. 90-1 § 2, eff. 3/8/90; Ord. 84-1077 § 1 (Exhibit B) (B), eff. 11/1/84; Prior Code § 10-87.1)

 

Section 12-24.03. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms are defined as follows:

(a)   “Airport elevation” means the highest point on the usable landing surface and is given as two hundred fifty-nine (259) feet above mean sea level.

(b)  “Airport reference point” means a fixed point at the approximate center of the airport takeoff and landing area and is given as the established airport elevation of two hundred fifty-eight (258) feet above mean sea level.

(c)   “Approach surface” means a surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface and it expands uniformly to a width of one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet for that end of a runway other than a utility runway with only visual approaches and sixteen thousand (16,000) feet for precision instrument runways. The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1) for all utility and visual runways and ten thousand (10,000) feet at a slope of thirty-four (34) to one (1) for all nonprecision instrument runways other than utility and ten thousand (10,000) feet at a slope of fifty (50) to one (1) with an additional forty thousand (40,000) feet at a slope of forty (40) to one (1) for all precision instrument runways.

(d)  “Clear zone” means an area at ground level that begins at the end of each primary surface and extends with the width of each approach surface to terminate directly below each approach surface slope at the point or points where the slope reaches a height of fifty (50) feet above the elevation of the runway end or fifty (50) feet above the terrain at the outer extremity of the clear zone, whichever distance is shorter.

(e)   “Effective length of runway” means the length of the associated primary surface plus an extension at each end providing for runway safety areas as provided in Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 150/5300-6 series.

(f)   “Effective width of runway” means the width of the associated existing or planned primary surface.

(g)   “Horizontal surface” means a horizontal plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.

(1)  The radius of each arc is:

(A)  Five thousand (5,000) feet for all runways designated as utility or visual;

(B)  Ten thousand (10,000) feet for all other runways.

(2)  The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest determined for either end of the runway. When a five thousand (5,000) foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two (2) adjacent ten thousand (10,000) foot arcs, the five thousand (5,000) foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal surface.

(h)  “Primary surface” means an imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the runway and extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is five hundred (500) feet for visual runways having only visual approaches, one thousand (1,000) feet for a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths (3/4) of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways.

(i)   “Transitional surface” means surfaces extending outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) to one (1) from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces.

Section 12-24.04. Height limitations.
No structure or object, including existing and proposed manmade objects and objects of natural growth, shall be erected, maintained or allowed to grow or exist in the airport approach district to a height in excess of the height limitation specified in this section for such area. Height limitations are heights above the airport elevation. The following height limitations are established:

(a)   Effective Width of Runway. No structure, tree or other obstruction is permitted within the effective width of runway, regardless of height, except approved instrument or visual landing systems.

(b)  Effective Length of Runway. No structure, tree or other obstruction is permitted within the effective length of runway, regardless of height, except approved instrument or visual landing systems.

(c)   Transition Area. The height to be determined within the boundaries of the transition area shall be at a ratio of seven (7) to one (1) commencing at the edge of the effective width of runway.

(d)  Horizontal Surface. No structure or obstruction shall be allowed in excess of one hundred fifty (150) feet above established airport elevation.

(e)   Runway Approach Area. The elevation, above the end of the primary surface for the runway, of the highest point of any structure or object within such runway approach surface directly above the primary surface for such object or structure. The inclined plane described herein is related to the glide ratio of planes landing or taking off from the runway. (Ord. 84-1077 § 1(Exhibit B) (B), eff. 11/1/84; Prior Code § 10-87.3)

 

Section 12-24.05. Electrical and lighting interference.
No use may be made of land within the airport approach district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communications which may be established at the airport nor the use of lights within the zone, making it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, resulting in glare in the eyes of the pilots using the airport, impairing visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endangering the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft. (Ord. 84-1077 § 1 (Exhibit B) (B), eff. 11/1/84; Prior Code § 10-87.4)

 

Section 12-24.06. Development: Standards.
The following development standards are intended to meet the requirements as specified in the Santa Barbara County Airport Land Use Plan as prepared by the Santa Barbara County airport land use commission and adopted by the Santa Barbara County-Cities Area Planning Council. When development proposals located in the AA (airport approach district combining regulations) zoning district are considered for approval by the City, the following standards shall be applied whenever feasible:

(a)   When siting buildings, locate permanent structures and population as far away from the extended runway centerline as feasible.

(b)  Locate open areas, parking lots, etc., along the extended runway centerline.

(c)   Restrict uses with concentrations of persons greater than twenty-five (25) persons per acre.

(d)  Restrict uses that require the storage of concentrations of hazardous and toxic materials. Any use that requires the storage of more than ten (10) gallons of hazardous or toxic material shall submit a safety plan to the Fire Department for approval prior to issuance of any permits.

(e)   Prohibit the use of any materials which would cause sunlight to be reflected toward an aircraft on initial climb or final approach.

(f)   Prohibit any use that would generate smoke or attract large concentrations of birds or which may otherwise affect safe air navigation within the area.

(g)   Prohibit any use which would direct steady or flashing lights at aircraft during initial climb or final approach, other than FAA-approved navigational signal or visual approach slope indicator (VASI).

(h)  Prohibit any use which would generate electrical interference that may be detrimental to operation of aircraft or airport instrumentation. (Ord. 84-1077 § 1 (Exhibit B) (B), eff. 11/1/84; Prior Code § 10-87.5(part), (1-8))

 

Section 12-24.07. Development: Review.
Projects located in the AA (airport approach district combining regulations) zoning district shall be submitted to the airport land use commission for review and comment prior to Planning Commission action, or prior to issuance of any permits if the use is a permitted use not requiring Planning Commission action. Also, projects providing for construction of objects which will penetrate and imaginary surface extending outward and upward at a slope of one hundred (100) to one (1) to a horizontal distance of twenty thousand (20,000) feet measured from the nearest point on the nearest runway shall submit the proposed project to the Federal Aviation Administration for airspace analysis, as provided in Federal Aviation Regulations Part 77.17.

CHAPTER 12-25  PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT
Section 12-25.01. Regulations designated.
The sections of this chapter constitute the regulations of the PD (planned development overlay) district. (Prior Code § 10-86)

 

Section 12-25.02. Intent.
(a)   The PD (planned development overlay) district is designed and intended to provide for the orderly development of land in conformance with the comprehensive land use element and other elements of the General Plan of the City by permitting a flexible design approach to the development of a total community environment equal to or better than that resulting from traditional lot by lot development. The district is designed and intended to accommodate various types of development such as neighborhood and district shopping centers, professional and administrative office complexes, multiple housing developments, single-family residential developments, commercial service centers and light industrial parks or any other use or combination of uses which can be made appropriately a part of a total planned development, in accordance with City General Plan and any applicable specific plan.

The requirements and procedures set in this chapter are designed and intended to be applied in such a manner as to provide maximum design flexibility to the property owner or developer, yet allow the City to retain control over design features and arrangements of uses within the project. The “PD” designation may combine with the various zones called out in the provisions of this title.

(b)  The PD–f (planned development/freeway tower overlay) district is designed and intended to provide for regulatory and design control of taller architecturally designed signs for commercial and industrial centers located along U.S. Highway 101, consistent with the intent and objectives of Chapter 12-34 and the General Plan.

CHAPTER 12-25A  H HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT
Section 12-25A.01. Intent.
(a)   The H (historic overlay) district is intended to encourage but not mandate the preservation of architecturally significant structures by permitting relaxed development standards such as parking requirements and setbacks in recognition of the preservation of architectural features, which are no longer commonly used in design practice and considered important to the social fabric of the community.

Revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate account. These revenues, and any interest earned on them, shall be used only to:

(a)   Pay for future cost of engineering, design, contract administration and other costs of construction of street and alley lighting, or to reimburse the City for street or alley lighting constructed with funds advanced from other sources; or

(b)  Reimburse developers who have been required or authorized to install supplemental street or alley lighting.

CHAPTER 12-34  SIGNS
Section 12-34.01. Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate signs located on private property within the City and on property owned by public agencies other than the City and over which the City has zoning and land use regulatory power. (Ord. 2005-09, eff. 9/2/05; Ord. 92-19, eff. 12/31/92)

 

Section 12-34.02 Objectives.
Signs can have either a positive or negative impact on the character and quality of the City. As a prominent part of the scenery, they attract or repel the viewing public, affect the safety of vehicular traffic, and set the tone of a neighborhood and the City. The objectives of this Chapter include the following:

(a)   To implement the City’s community design and safety standards as set forth in the City’s General Plan, specific plans, and Municipal Code.

(b)  To maintain and enhance the City’s appearance by regulating the design, character, location, number, type, size, illumination, and maintenance of signs.

(c)   To serve the City’s interests in maintaining and enhancing its visual appeal for residents, tourists, and other visitors, by preventing the degradation of visual quality which can result from excessive and poorly designed, located, or maintained signage.

(d)  To generally limit commercial signage to on-site locations in order to protect the aesthetic environment from the visual clutter associated with the unrestricted proliferation of signs, while providing channels of communication to the public.

(e)   To limit the size, number, and construction of signs to levels that reasonably allow for the free communication of ideas, consistent with the other purposes of this ordinance.

(f)   To encourage signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located and consistent with the permitted and conditional uses applied to the subject property.

(g)   To establish sizes of signs in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the signs are to be placed or to which they pertain.

(h)  To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property, including streets, sidewalks, roads, and highways.

(i)   To protect and improve pedestrian and vehicular safety by balancing the need for signs that facilitate the safe and smooth flow of traffic (e.g., directional signs and on-site signs) without an excess of signage which may distract drivers or overload the mental capacity to quickly receive and interpret information.

(j)   To reduce hazardous situations, confusion, and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, placement, illumination, animation and excessive height, and area and bulk of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and motorists.

(k)  To respect and protect the right of free speech by sign display, while reasonably regulating the structural, locational, and other non-communicative aspects of signs, generally for the public health, safety, and welfare, and specifically to serve the public interests in community aesthetics, traffic, and pedestrian safety.

(l)   To enable the fair, consistent, and effective enforcement of the sign regulations of the City. (Ord. 2005-09, eff. 9/2/05; Ord. 92-19, eff. 12/31/92)

Section 12-34.04. General Requirements.
(a)   Applicability. This chapter regulates signs located on private property within all zoning districts of the City and on property owned by public agencies other than the City and over which the City has zoning and land use regulatory power. Except where otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, all signs located in such areas of the City shall receive design review and shall be erected and maintained in conformity with this chapter. The consent of the property owner is necessary before any sign may be erected on any private property or public sidewalk within the City.

(b)  Sign Permit Required. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to place, erect, structurally or electrically alter (not including a change in sign copy of sign face), move or display or maintain any temporary or permanent sign without first obtaining a sign permit from the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. No sign permit is required for cleaning or other normal maintenance of a properly approved sign, unless a structural or electrical change is made.

(c)   Sign Plan Required. On a multi-tenant building or multi-building site, a master sign plan shall be prepared by the owner for review and approval by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with Section 12-34.07. The purpose of the master sign plan is to ensure compliance with this chapter, promote continuity of sign design and to spread the amount of sign area permitted among the buildings and businesses within a multi-tenant building or multi-building site. Temporary signage may be allowed in accordance with Section 12-34.05(d) upon the approval of a complete master sign plan.

(d)  Noncommercial Signs. Noncommercial signs are allowed whenever commercial signage is permitted and are subject to the same standards and total maximum allowances per site or building of each sign type specified in this chapter. For purposes of this chapter, all noncommercial free speech messages are deemed to be on-site, regardless of location.

(e)   Substitution of Noncommercial Message. Subject to the consent of the property owner, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for all or part of the commercial or noncommercial message on any sign allowed under this chapter. No special or additional approval is required to substitute a noncommercial message for any other message on an allowable sign, provided the sign structure is already approved or exempt from the approval requirement and no structural or electrical change is made. When a noncommercial message is substituted for any other message, however, the sign is still subject to the same design, size, locational, and structural regulations (e.g., color, materials, height, size, illumination, maintenance, duration of display, etc.) as well as all building and electrical code requirements, as would apply if the sign were used to display a commercial message. In the event of any perceived or actual conflict between the general provisions of this subsection and any other specific provisions in this chapter, the provisions of this subsection shall prevail.

(f)   Substitution of Commercial Messages. Substitution of a commercial message is not automatically allowed in a place where only a noncommercial message is allowed. In addition, no off-site commercial messages may be substituted for on-site commercial messages.

(g)   Construction Materials. All permanent signs shall be constructed of wood, metal, plastic, ceramic tile, glass or like material (or paint on a building such as a painted wall sign) as approved by the Director of Community Development.

(h)  Area of Signs.

(1)  A “double-face sign” with parallel planes, back-to-back, not more than 24 inches apart, shall count as a single sign and only one side shall be counted for the total sign area.

(2)  In the case of a multi-face sign other than a double-faced sign, the outer dimensions of all the sign faces shall be combined. The sign area shall be the total area of all the faces.

(3)  In the event a sign falls under more than one sign definition, the more restrictive sign regulations found in this chapter shall apply.

(4)  Sign face changes to a legally established sign which do not structurally alter the sign (including sign area and configuration) shall not require a sign permit.

(5)  The total sign area allowed on a parcel shall be calculated as the sum of the sign areas of all signs on the parcel except directional structures and temporary signs.

(6)  The total sign area allowed on a parcel shall be up to one square foot of sign area for each lineal foot of building occupancy frontage or parcel frontage, whichever is greater, except that all properties are allowed a minimum of 25 square feet of sign area regardless of the building or parcel width. The Zoning Administrator, through the sign permit process, shall determine whether proposed sign area is compatible with the proposed architecture of the building and with other properties in the vicinity. Sites with multiple tenants shall be required to submit a sign program, for approval by the Zoning Administrator, to determine the share of total sign area for each tenant space.

i.     Parcels adjacent to more than one public street, public alley, or freeway may be allowed to count each frontage toward the total sign area for the parcel. As part of the sign permit review process, the Zoning Administrator shall ensure that the sign area is appropriately distributed among said frontages in order to avoid signs that are visually out of proportion with each particular building face.

ii.    Bonus Sign Area: The total sign area may be increased by 25% for that portion of a building that has a height of 20 feet or more of habitable interior space. As part of the sign permit review process, the Zoning Administrator shall ensure that the amount of the bonus sign area allowed does not result in signage that is out of proportion with the building.

(7)  The area of a sign shall be calculated by forming a box to enclose the entire sign. The box must be a continuous line consisting of not more than eight straight lines that form right angles. The area within the box shall be the sign area.

(8)  The supporting structure of any sign, including monument base or masonry veneer, shall not be included in determining the sign area.

(i)   Location. All sign structures shall comply with sight distance requirements for corner visibility of pedestrians and vehicles (Sec. 12-27.03).

(j)   Freeway Tower Signs. Refer to Section 12-25.03(b)(5).

(k)  Architecturally Designed Sign Towers Along Primary and Secondary Arterial Streets. The Planning Commission, through a Planned Development Permit or Conditional Use Permit (ref. Chapter 35 of Title 12) may permit, or conditionally permit, sign towers in the C-1 and C-2 zoning districts along primary and secondary arterial streets as defined in the Circulation Element of the General Plan. The sign towers shall not exceed a height of 25 feet above finished grade. The total sign area shall not be greater than 200 square feet per tower. The design of the sign towers must be consistent with the adopted General Plan. The sign tower must make a positive design statement for the City of Santa Maria, be architecturally compatible with the architecture of the adjoining buildings, and must include substantial adjacent landscaping.

(l)   Illumination. Illumination shall be allowed on all signs upon the approval of a sign permit. Illuminated signs may be lighted either by exterior or interior means. Illuminated signs shall be designed in such a manner as to avoid glare or reflection of light on private property in the surrounding area or onto public rights-of-way. Illumination of signs shall comply with all adopted model building codes of the City of Santa Maria.

(m) Limitation on Number of Signs Affixed to a Building. Up to four signs may be permitted on any building face for a single tenant, subject to a determination by the Zoning Administrator that the proposed signage does not clutter the building face.

(n)  Maintenance. All signs shall be maintained in a neat and orderly appearance, including, but not limited to, repairing all holes, tears, fading, chipping, structural defects, and partial or full loss of illumination.

Before it may grant a variance, and based upon information shown in the application and verified by staff report, or upon further information brought forth during the course of the hearing, the Planning Commission must find that because of special circumstances applicable to the property including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of the provisions of this title deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning district classification.

(b)  Every variance from the provisions of this title granted by the Planning Commission, or where applicable on appeal thereof by the City Council, shall be granted only subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which the subject property is situated, and shall contain as a condition thereof the following:

The Planning Commission may, in its discretion and with the consent or upon the request of the applicant, for any cause, grant a reasonable extension of time in addition to the one hundred and eighty (180) days herein provided.

CHAPTER 12-45  REGULATION OF ADULT BUSINESSES
Section 12-45.101. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate Adult Oriented Businesses which, because of their very nature, are believed to have many of the recognized significant secondary effects on the community which include, but are not limited to: higher crime rates, noise, debris or vandalism in the vicinity of Adult Oriented Businesses; and blighting conditions such as low level maintenance of commercial premises and parking lots which thereby have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of the Adult Oriented Businesses. It is neither the intent, nor effect of this chapter to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent, nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to Sexually Oriented Materials or Merchandise protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of Adult Oriented Business to their intended market.

Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any City ordinance or any statute of the State of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof.

Section 12-47.04. Permit and reclamation plan requirement.
(a)   Any person, except as provided in Public Resources Code Section 2776, who proposes to engage in surface mining operations as defined in this chapter shall, prior to the commencement of such operations, obtain from the City of Santa Maria (1) a conditional use permit to mine in accordance with Chapter 35 of Title 12, and (2) approval of a Reclamation Plan, in accordance with the provisions set forth in this chapter and as further provided in Article 5, California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975.

All applications for a Reclamation Plan for surface mining operations shall be made on forms provided by the Planning Division of the City Community Development Department, and as called for by Public Resources Code Section 2776.

(b)  No person who has obtained a vested right to conduct a surface mining operation prior to January 1, 1976, shall be required to secure a permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter as long as such vested right continues, provided that no substantial change is made in that operation except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A person shall be deemed to have such vested rights if, prior to January 1, 1976, he/she has in good faith and in reliance upon a permit or other authorization, if such permit or other authorization was required, diligently commenced surface mining operations and incurred substantial liabilities for work and materials necessary therefor. Expenses incurred in obtaining the enactment of an ordinance in relation to a particular operation or the issuance of a permit shall not be deemed liabilities for work or materials.

A person who has obtained a vested right to conduct surface mining operations prior to January 1, 1976 shall submit to the City Planning Department and receive, within a reasonable period of time, approval of a Reclamation Plan for operations to be conducted after January 1, 1976, unless a Reclamation Plan was approved by the City of Santa Maria prior to January 1, 1976, and the person submitting that plan has accepted the responsibility for reclaiming the mined lands in accordance with that plan. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as requiring the filing of a Reclamation Plan for, or the reclamation of, mined lands on which surface mining operations were conducted prior to, but not after, January 1, 1976.

(c)   The conditional use permit (CUP) application and proposed Reclamation Plan shall be sent to the director of the Department of Conservation (Department) within thirty (30) days of the filing of the application.

(d)  A fee as established for the permitted uses in the City Fee Ordinance, shall be paid to the City of Santa Maria, Department of Community Development, at the time of filing. This fee may be reviewed and revised by resolution of the City Council.

(e)   Within ninety (90) days of a mine becoming idle, the operator must submit to the City an Interim Management Plan (IMP) for review and approval. The IMP is considered an amendment to the Reclamation Plan and is subject to the City’s review per this chapter and the review of the Department of Conservation. Idle mines shall maintain financial assurances and are subject to annual inspections. (Ord. 94-4, eff. 3/31/94; Ord. 93-23, eff. 8/19/93)

The Planning Division shall determine the amount of the surety based on the estimated cost of the reclamation of all lands disturbed after January 1, 1976, and lands proposed to be disturbed in the upcoming year. Such surety shall be executed in favor of the City of Santa Maria and the Department of Conservation, reviewed annually, and renewed and revised as necessary. All financial assurances, and amendments thereto, shall be forwarded to the Department of Conservation for review at least forty-five (45) days prior to formal City approval of the financial assurance. Such surety shall be maintained in an amount equal to the cost of completing the remaining reclamation of the site as prescribed in the approved or amended Reclamation Plan during the succeeding two (2) year period, or other reasonable term. (Ord. 94-4, eff. 3/31/94; Ord. 93-23, eff. 8/19/93)

 

Section 12-47.07. Public records.
Reclamation Plans, reports, applications, and other documents submitted pursuant to this chapter are public records unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such information, or part thereof, would reveal production, reserves, or rate of depletion entitled to protection as proprietary information. The City shall identify such proprietary information as a separate part of each application. A copy of all permits, Reclamation Pans, reports, applications, and other documents submitted pursuant to this chapter, including proprietary information, shall be furnished to the District Geologist of the State Division of Mines and Geology by the City of Santa Maria.

CHAPTER 12-48  DENSITY BONUS
Section 12-48.01. Purpose and Intent.
The Housing Element of the General Plan sets forth various goals and policies to encourage a variety of housing types and costs to serve the various economic needs within the community. It is the intent of the City to further encourage the provision of lower cost, very low cost and senior housing by providing a density bonus program. (Ord. 95-9, eff. 08/31/95)

 

Section 12-48.02. Compliance with Government Code Section 65915.
In accordance with Government Code Section 65915 et seq., or successor sections, the Planning Commission and/or City Council shall provide the developer incentives for the production of moderate income, lower income, very low income or senior housing units when the developer meets the requirements set forth in this chapter. In the event the Legislature amends specific requirements of Section 65915 et seq. or successor sections, those amendments shall control and apply in Santa Maria pending further amendment of this chapter. (Ord. 2006-17, eff. 1/18/07; Ord. 95-9, eff. 08/31/95)

 

Section 12-48.03. Density Bonuses.
Any housing development of five (5) or more units as defined by 50073.5 the Health and Safety Code, any senior citizen housing development as defined in Section 51.3 of the Civil Code, any mobilehome park that limits residency to older persons pursuant to Civil Code §798.76 or 799.5, and any common interest development project as defined below, shall be entitled to a density bonus above the maximum number of dwelling units otherwise allowed by this title, in the amount calculated as specified by Government Code Section 65915(g), if the proposed development project meets the following minimum criteria:

(a)   Ten percent (10%) of the total units in the project, before the density bonus is applied, is reserved for lower income households as defined in Section 50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code; or

(b)  Five percent (5%) of the total units in the project, before the density bonus is applied, is reserved for very low income households, as defined in Section 50105 of the Health and Safety Code; or

(c)   Fifty percent (50%) of the total units in the project, before the density bonus is applied, is reserved for qualifying residents as specified in Section 51.3 of the State Civil Code or

(d)  Ten percent (10%) of the total dwelling units in a Civil Code §1351 common interest development project, before the density bonus is applied, are reserved for persons and families of moderate income, provided that all of the units are offered to the public for purchase.

Any applicant proposing to develop one or more residential units whose project does not meet the definitions above shall also be entitled to receive a density bonus if the residential units will be reserved for lower or very low income households. (Ord. 2006-17, eff. 1/18/07; Ord. 95-9, eff. 08/31/95)

 

Section 12-48.04. Additional Incentives for Affordable Units.
(a)   In addition to the density bonus provided by Section 12-48-03, the City shall, through a planned development permit, agreement, or subdivision, grant additional incentives or concessions in the number specified by subsection (d)(1) of Government Code Section 65915. Examples include:

(1)  Reducing or waiving development standards, modifying or waiving zoning requirements (including minimum lot size or setbacks), and modifying architectural design requirements or Public Works requirements which result in identifiable cost reductions; or

(2)  Providing other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the City, so as to result in identifiable cost reductions; or

(3)  Allowing the developer to pay development impact fees over a period of time not to exceed three (3) years in equal installments. The terms of an approval under this section shall be reflected in a written agreement containing provisions for interest and security approved by the Finance Director and City Attorney; or

(4)  Approving mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the project.

(b)  The applicant for a density bonus may submit a proposal requesting specific concessions or incentives to staff for Commission or Council consideration. In the case of a proposal that would not qualify for additional concessions or incentives due to the small number of units proposed, the applicant may request to substitute a specific concession or incentive in place of a density bonus.

(c)   The Commission or Council shall grant a requested concession or incentive for a project described in Section 12-48.03, subsections (a) through (d), unless it makes a written finding based on substantial evidence either:

(1)  that the additional incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code or for rents for the targeted units as specified in Section 65915(c) of the California Government Code; or

(2)  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon the public health and safety or upon the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.

Section 12-48.06 was repealed in its entirety and deleted per Ordinance 2006-17.

 

Section 12-48.07. Procedure for Density Bonus
Applications for residential projects that request a density bonus which will increase the density beyond that otherwise allowed in a specified zoning district, shall be processed in a manner consistent with procedures for a standard residential project in its designated zoning district. Developers requesting incentives described in 12-48-04(a)(1), however, shall apply for a planned development (PD) permit per Section 12-35 whether or not the project site is located in a planned development overlay zone. The PD process allows discretionary review of the project to implement the incentives and appropriate enforcement measures.

The developer may submit to the Community Development Department a written proposal for a project pursuant to this chapter prior to the submittal of any formal development applications. Within ninety (90) days of receipt of a proposal, the City shall notify the developer, in writing, of the procedures to be followed to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The materials submitted by the developer must clearly indicate how the requested waiver(s) or modification(s) are necessary to make the proposed housing units economically feasible. Additional information for density bonus projects required when the proposal is submitted include:

(a)   A written description that specifies the number, type, location, size and construction scheduling of units in the project which will be designated as the affordable or senior units.

(b)  Indication of the percentage of units that will be reserved for moderate, low or very low income or senior households. (Ord. 2006-17, eff. 1/18/07; Ord. 95-9, eff. 08/31/95)

 

Section 12-48.08. Affordable Housing Density Bonus Agreement.
(a)   To be eligible for a density bonus, the developer must sign a binding agreement with the City, approved by the City Attorney’s office, which sets forth the conditions and requirements to be met in the implementation of the density bonus program. The Agreement will also establish specified compliance standards and remedies available to the City upon failure by the developer to make units accessible to intended households. The relevant terms and conditions of the density bonus agreement shall be filed and recorded on those individual lots or units of a project development which are designated for the location of target dwelling units.

(b)  The term of the agreement shall be at least thirty (30) years, or such other period as may be required by a financing program for the project.

(c)   When the agreement pertains to moderate-income units in a common interest development, the agreement shall contain provisions for equity sharing as required by Government Code Section 65915(c), or successor section. (Ord. 2006-17, eff. 1/18/07; Ord. 95-9, eff. 08/31/95)

 

Section 12-48.09. Requirements for Participation.
In order for a developer to participate in the density bonus program and be eligible for incentives, the following requirements must be met:

(a)   The developer shall set aside, per the approved agreement, the number of units which are designated for moderate, low, very low or senior households. A unit will be counted toward meeting the set-aside requirement if it is either vacant or occupied by a qualified resident.

(b)  The target units must be compatible in floor plan, furnishings, and exterior design to the nondesignated units. Further, the target units must be equally dispersed in each phase throughout the development.

(c)   The maximum allowable rents to comply with the density bonus law are determined by a formula designated by the State Department of Housing and Community Development based on area median income.

(d)  Dwellings sold per the agreement shall be affordable to the designated income households as defined by income limits established by the State Department of Housing and Community Development.

(e)   The developer shall provide to the Community Development Department a yearly accounting of the total units occupied, the total units vacant, the total units occupied by lower or very low income households, and the total by which the units set aside fell short of the required number of units. The distribution (location) of the affordable units must also be shown. (Ord. 2006-17, eff. 1/18/07; Ord. 95-9, eff. 08/31/95)

CHAPTER 12-49  MIXED-USE PROJECTS
Section 12-49.01 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations pertaining to the development of mixed-use projects within the City. It is intended to provide standards for projects that include a combination of permitted uses and other compatible uses not permitted in a single established zoning district. (Ord. 2004-18, eff. 12/16/04)

 

Section 12-49.02 Objectives
The objective of this chapter is to encourage a compatible mixture of residential, commercial, industrial, public, and recreational uses.

(a)   Properly designed and developed mixed-use projects shall further goals of the City’s General Plan. Specifically, mixed-use projects should:

(1)  Promote incubator businesses;

(2)  Improve the aesthetics of the built environment;

(3)  Promote an appropriate balance and scale of commercial uses that meet the need of nearby residents and workers;

(4)  Provide sufficient safe and accessible plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment;

(5)  Improve the quality of air and water through provisions for the planting of trees, greenspace protection, bicycle parking, car sharing, and electric vehicle parking;

(6)  Reduce traffic by encouraging neighborhoods connected by mass-transit routes, safe and comfortable pedestrian access, and multi purpose trails;

(7)  Expand residential opportunities;

(8)  Improve health, safety, and welfare;

(9)  Reduce urban sprawl; and,

(10)        Promote in-fill development.

(b)  An appropriate mixed-use development is:

(1)  Diverse and contains a representative mix of residents, workers, and uses;

(2)  Complete in that it is sustainable for the residents, workers, and patrons;

(3)  Compact in that it contains the highest and best use for the land it occupies;

(4)  Connected by safe streets, sidewalks, and multi-purpose trails; and

(5)  Walkable/Transit Accessible so it is easily accessible without benefit of an automobile.

(Ord. 2004-18, eff. 12/16/04)

 

Section 12-49.03 Definitions
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

(a)   Accessory Use. “Accessory Use” means a use incidental, related, appropriate, and clearly subordinate to the main use of the lot or building, which accessory use does not alter the principal use of the subject lot or adversely affect other properties in the zone.

(b)  Downtown Specific Plan Area. The Downtown Specific Plan Area is the area described in the Santa Maria Downtown Specific Plan.

(c)   Infill Development. Infill development refers to construction of new housing, workplaces, shops, and other facilities within existing urban or suburban areas. The development can be of several types: building on vacant lots, reuse of underutilized sites (such as parking lots and old industrial sites), and rehabilitation or expansion of existing buildings.

(d)  Live-Work/Work-Live Units. Live-Work/Work-Live units are single tenant spaces that include both a residential unit and a commercial or light industrial use such as an artist studio, photography studio, craftsperson shop (woodworking, ceramics, etc.), or similar use. This differs from other types of mixed-use developments where the residential use and commercial or other non-residential use is in different tenant spaces. Live-work units comprise one or more rooms with cooking space and sanitary facilities in conformance with the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and adequate working space available for and regularly used by persons residing therein.

(e)   Lot. Lot means a parcel of land of at least sufficient size to meet zoning requirements for use, coverage, area and open space as required by this code.

(f)   Large efficiency Unit. Large efficiency units are residential units that are between 400 and 600 square feet in size.

(g)   Small Efficiency Unit. Small efficiency units are residential units that are 400 square feet or less in size. (Ord. 2004-18, eff. 12/16/04)

 

Section 12-49.04 General Requirements
(a)   Unless otherwise specifically required by this chapter, a Planned Development (PD) permit or Conditional Use Permit (CUP) shall be required for mixed-use developments in conformance with Figure 1 in Section 12-49.05. An Administrative Use Permit shall be required for permitted projects that exceed the maximum height or setback requirements by 10 percent (10%) or less, or do not meet the minimum parking, open space or landscape requirements by 10 percent (10%) or less. Projects that exceed the required maximum height or setback requirements by more than 10 percent (10%), but less than or equal to twenty-five percent (25%), or do not meet the minimum parking, landscape, or open space requirements by more than 10 percent (10%), but less than or equal to twenty-five percent (25%) require a Conditional Use Permit approved by the Planning Commission, even when such project is otherwise permitted. A project that exceeds maximum height or reduces the minimum setback requirements by more than twenty-five percent (25%), or does not meet minimum landscape or open space requirements by more than twenty-five percent (25%) requires a Conditional Use Permit approved by the City Council after consideration by the Planning Commission. No project that fails to meet minimum parking requirements by more than twenty-five percent (25%) can be approved in any case. The planned development, conditional use, or administrative use permit shall be processed in accordance with Chapter 35 of this title.

(b)  Tentative and final or parcel maps shall be required for all mixed-use projects that include the creation of lots, condominiums, stock cooperatives, community apartments and planned unit developments, both new and conversion. (Ord. 2004-18, eff. 12/16/04)

 

Section 12-49.05. Mix of Uses
At the time of a planned development or conditional use permit application for a mixed-use development, the applicant shall declare from Figure 1, the proposed mix of uses for the project.

(b)  Accessory dwelling units do not exceed the allowable density for the lot upon which the accessory dwelling unit is located, and are a residential use that is consistent with the existing general plan and zoning designation for the lot.

(c)   R-2 and R-3 zones. Property owners living in R-2 and R-3 zones with an existing single family structure on site may elect to build an accessory dwelling unit. In addition, if an R-2 or R-3 lot is vacant and the property owner proposed to construct a single family dwelling on the lot, an accessory dwelling unit may also be constructed. However, if an R-2 or R-3 lot has a single family structure with an accessory dwelling unit or approved plans issued by the Community Development Department to construct a single family structure with an accessory dwelling unit, and if the property owner applies to build any additional units, each unit, including the single family structure and the accessory dwelling unit, will be subject to all zoning requirements and development standards for R-2 and/or R-3 zones. (Ord. 2017-21, eff. 1/18/18)

 

Section 12-56.02. Purpose.
This Chapter constitutes the regulations for accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on residential lots developed or proposed to be developed with single-family dwellings. Such accessory dwellings contribute needed housing to the community’s housing stock. Therefore, accessory dwelling units are considered to be a residential use, consistent with the General Plan objectives and zoning regulations, and enhance housing opportunities, including near transit on single family lots. (Ord. 2017-21, eff. 1/18/18)

 

Section 12-56.03. Definitions.
(a)   An “accessory dwelling unit” is an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. It includes permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as a primary dwelling unit is situated. An accessory dwelling unit also includes the following:

(b)  An efficiency unit, as defined in Section 17958.1 of Health and Safety Code

(c)   A manufactured home, as defined in Section 18007 of the Health and Safety Code

(d)  The term “existing structure,” for the purposes of defining an allowable space that can be converted to an accessory dwelling unit means, within the four walls and roofline of any structure existing on or after January 1, 2017 that can be made safely habitable under local building codes at the determination of the building official regardless of any non-compliance with zoning standards.

(e)   “Guest quarters” is a detached accessory structure under 150 square feet in size consisting of one room, up to a full bath, and no cooking facilities or wet bars or second sink.

(f)   “Living area” means the interior habitable area of a dwelling unit, including basements and attics, not including the garage or any nonhabitable accessory structure.

(g)   “Passageway” is a pathway that is unobstructed clear to the sky and extends from a street to one entrance of the accessory dwelling unit.

(h)  “Public transit” means a public transit corridor as defined by Health and Safety Code section 50093.5, which is that area within one-quarter mile of a route on which the level of service is at or above the average for the transit system as a whole, according to the transit operator serving the area, and on which regularly scheduled public mass transit service stops are located, or within one-quarter mile of an existing or planned public mass transit guideway or busway station, or within one-quarter mile of a multimodal transportation terminal serving public mass transit operations. (Ord. 2017-21, eff. 1/18/18)

 

Section 12-56.04. Development standards.
(a)   Accessory structures within existing space. An accessory dwelling unit within an existing structure (e.g. the primary dwelling unit, attached or detached garage or other accessory structure) shall be permitted ministerially with a building permit if it:

(1)  Complies with building and safety codes;

(2)  Provides independent exterior access from the existing residence;

(3)  Provides sufficient side and rear setbacks for fire safety.

(b)  Accessory structures (attached and detached).

(1)  General.

a.     Sale of Unit. The unit may not be sold separate from the primary dwelling unit. All conditions of the use permit, restrictive covenants, and other contractual agreements with the City apply to the property.

b.    Rental of Unit. Rental of the accessory dwelling unit is allowed.

c.     Owner-Occupancy. For properties in the R-1 zoning district, either the primary dwelling unit or the Accessory Dwelling Unit shall be owner-occupied as a primary dwelling unit and permanent residence by the property owner(s).

(i)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that neither of the units are occupied by the property owner, the approval of the accessory dwelling unit shall terminate immediately and the unit shall not be rented, leased, or occupied as a separate dwelling.

(ii)  For the purposes of this Chapter, the property owner is the majority owner of the property as shown in the most recent Santa Barbara County assessor’s roll. If there is more than one property owner of record, the owner with the majority interest in the property shall be deemed the property owner. Any property owner of record holding an equal share interest in the property may be deemed the majority property owner.

(2)  Covenant Agreement. A covenant agreement is required prior to issuance of a building permit. The covenant agreement shall state that

a.     The accessory dwelling unit shall not be sold separately.

(i)   The unit is restricted to the approved size.

(ii)  The property owner is required to reside in the primary dwelling unit or the accessory dwelling unit.

(iii) The use of the accessory dwelling unit shall be in effect only so long as the property is in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.

(7)  Utility Meters. Accessory dwelling units shall not be considered new residential uses for the purpose of calculating utility connection fees or capacity charges, including water and sewer service. Accessory dwelling units contained within an existing residence or an existing accessory structure are not required to install new or separate utility connections, or pay a related connection fee or capacity charge. For new attached and detached accessory dwelling units, the connection fee and/or capacity charge must be proportionate to the burden of the unit on the water or sewer system based on the size or the number of plumbing fixtures.

(g)   Parking.

(1)  Parking for accessory dwelling units shall be provided at a rate of one parking space per ADU. These spaces shall be provided in conformance with Section 12-32.12, except that tandem parking is allowed for ADU’s as stated in Government Code section 65852.2(a)(1)(D)(x) unless specific findings are made that parking in setback areas or tandem parking is not feasible based upon specific site or regional topographical or fire and life safety conditions.

(2)  Parking requirements for an accessory dwelling unit are in addition to the required parking for the primary dwelling unit.

(3)  Parking is not required in the following instances:

a.     The accessory dwelling unit is located within ½ mile of public transit.

ADUs shall be permitted ministerially, in compliance with this Chapter within 120 days of the filing of a complete application. The applicant shall be informed within 30 days after submission of an application if the application is complete. The Community Development Director shall issue a building permit or zoning certificate to establish an accessory dwelling unit in compliance with this Chapter if all applicable requirements in this Chapter are met, as appropriate. The Community Development Director may approve an accessory dwelling unit that is not in compliance with Section 12-56.04 as set forth in Section 12-56.06. (Ord. 2017-21, eff. 1/18/18)

 

Section 12-56.06. Review process for accessory structure not complying with development standards.

(b)  In order to approve an administrative use permit under Section 12-56.05 to waive required accessory dwelling unit parking, the Community Development Director shall find that additional or new on-site parking would be detrimental, and that granting the waiver will meet the purposes of this Chapter.

(c)   In order to approve an administrative use permit under Section 12-56.05 to waive any other development standard set forth in Section 12-56.04, the Community Development Direction shall make specific findings that granting the waiver will meet the purposes of this Chapter and not be detrimental or public health and safety, introduce unreasonable privacy impacts to the immediate neighbors, and would not overburden sewer and water services, or overburden traffic flow. (Ord. 2017-21, eff. 1/18/18)

 

Section 12-56.08. Existing non-conforming ADUs.
