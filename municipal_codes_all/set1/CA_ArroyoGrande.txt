ARROYO GRANDE, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Arroyo Grande, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 18, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The City of Arroyo Grande Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 18, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Kelly Wetmore, director of legislative and information services. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 18, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 697, passed October 23, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 18, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 18, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

The appeal notice shall include the required fee set by a resolution of the council. The council's authority to review the decision being appealed is not limited to the original reason stated for the appeal. The council may review and take action on all determinations, interpretations, decisions, judgments, or similar actions taken, and is not limited to the reason stated for the appeal.

C.  No right of appeal to the council from any administrative decision made by a city official under any of the provisions of this code shall exist when such decision is ministerial and thus does not involve the exercise of administrative discretion or personal judgment exercised under any of the provisions of this code, whether the administrative decision involves the approval, denial, suspension, or revocation of a license, permit, entitlement, or any other administrative decision.

All mailing of notices to contractors and construction trade journals shall be completed not less than ten (10) calendar days before bids are due. 
c.  The notice inviting informal bids shall describe the project in general terms, how to obtain more detailed information about the project, and state the time and place for the submission of bids.

F.  Open Purchase Orders. 
1.  Defined. "Open purchase orders" means a purchase where the acquisition is not made all at one time; it shall be a continuing order providing continuing authority to purchase from vendors who furnish monthly supplies or services in such volume as to justify the issuance of an open order. All open purchase orders shall state a maximum amount of expenditures. 
2.  Use. Upon the user department's written request therefor, an open purchase order may be prepared and issued. The original copy, after approval and signature, shall be forwarded to the vendor.

2.  The ability of the bidder to perform the contract, or provide the materials, supplies or services required, within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
3.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance, repair parts, and replacement of purchased materials or supplies; 
4.  Compliance by the bidder with federal acts, executive orders, and state statutes governing nondiscrimination in employment; 
5.  The results of any evaluation relating performance and price, such as testing. life cycle costing, and analysis of service, maintenance and technical data; 
6.  Fitness and quality being equal, a preference may be granted to local vendors for the purchase of materials, supplies and services. The city may provide a preference to each qualified local vendor if the bid of a local qualified vendor does not exceed the lowest bid or price quoted by other vendors by more than five percent. Application of the five percent preference in the award of the contract shall mean the amount by which the local vendor bid or estimate shall be deemed reduced in the city's bid award or selection process and shall not actually reduce the amount ultimately paid by the city to the successful bidder. To qualify as a local vendor, a business must have all current applicable city licenses and permits, must maintain its primary office, distribution point, or place of business within the city and must report and pay sales tax to the state of California that identifies the point of sale for taxable transactions as a location within the city limits.

If such an application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause, at a time and place fixed in such notice, why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, grantor shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of grantee's records for the preceding three calendar years, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of two percent or more, the grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit and the audit may be extended to include the preceding five-year period. 
C.  Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by the grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. 
D.  In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, grantee shall pay as additional compensation:

C.  If the security fund is drawn upon by grantor in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter and the franchise agreement, grantee shall cause the security fund to be replenished to the original amount no later than thirty (30) days after each withdrawal by grantor.

C.  In those areas of the city where the grantee's cables are located on the aboveground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone or electric power service, and in the event that the facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are placed underground at full cost to such public utilities, then the grantee likewise shall reconstruct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in above-ground enclosures, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement. 
D.  Any changes in or extensions of any poles, anchors, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals or other fixtures and equipment (herein referred to as "structures"), or the construction of any additional structures, in, upon, along, across, under or over the streets, alleys and public ways shall be made under the direction of grantor's city engineer or a designee, who shall, if the proposed change, extension or construction conforms to the provisions hereof, issue written permits thereof. The height above public thoroughfares of all aerial wires shall conform to the requirements of the California Public Utilities Commission or other regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof. 
1.  All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by the grantee shall be located so as not to interfere with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places, and not to interfere with existing public utility installations. 
2.  In the event that any property or improvement of the grantor in the public rights-of-way is disturbed or damaged by the grantee or any of its contractors, agents or employees in connection with undertaking any and all work pursuant to the right granted to the grantee pursuant to this chapter, the grantee shall promptly, at the grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition the property or improvement which was so disturbed or damaged, and in the event that any such property or improvement shall at any later time become uneven, unsettled or otherwise require restoration, repair or replacement because of such disturbance or damage by the grantee, then the grantee, as soon as reasonably possible, shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from the grantor and at the grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition the property or improvement which was disturbed or damaged. Any such restoration by the grantee shall be made in accordance with such materials and specifications as may, from time to time, be then provided for by grantor ordinance. 
3.  Prior to commencing any work in the public rights-of-way, the grantee shall obtain any and all permits lawfully required by such grantor codes and ordinances of general application for such work. In the event that emergency work may be required by the grantee, however, the grantee shall obtain any and all such permits within three working days after the beginning of such emergency work. 
4.  There shall be no unreasonable or unnecessary obstruction of the public rights-of-way by the grantee in connection with any of the work herein provided for, and the grantee shall maintain such barriers, signs and warning signals during any such work performed on or about the public rights-of-way or adjacent thereto as may be necessary to reasonably avoid injury or damage to life and property. 
5.  If at any time during the period of this franchise the grantor shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade or location on any street, alley or other public rights-of-way, the grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by the grantor, remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense, and in each instance comply with the requirements of the grantor; provided, that grantee shall have no such obligation if other public utilities occupying the same public rights-of-way are not also required to remove, relay or relocate their poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at their own expense. 
6.  The grantee shall not place poles, conduits or other fixtures above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone fixtures, water hydrants or other utility, and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed as to comply with all ordinances of the grantor. 
7.  The grantee may be required by the grantor to permit joint use of its utility poles and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys or other public rights-of-way, by utilities insofar as such joint use may be reasonably practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental therefor; provided that in the absence of agreement regarding such joint use, the city council shall provide for arbitration of the terms and conditions of such joint use and the compensation to be paid therefrom, which award shall be final. 
8.  The grantee shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the grantor, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of buildings, the expense of such temporary removal to be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary changes. 
9.  The grantee shall have the authority, except when in conflict with existing grantor ordinances, to trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the grantee, except that at the option of the grantor, such trimming may be done by it, or under its supervision and direction, at the expense of the grantee. 
E.  In the event of multiple franchisees desiring to serve new residential developments in which the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of underground easements. 
1.  The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire to provide cable television service to that development. The developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. 
2.  If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared cost basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate to the city any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled to recover the costs of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event that grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee. 
3.  The developer shall provide at least ten (10) working days' notice of the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall have two working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five working days after beginning installation to complete installation. 
4.  The final development map shall not be approved until the developer submits evidence that: 
a.  It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches are to be open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and 
b.  It has received a written notification from each grantee that the grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the developer and the grantee, or has received no reply from a grantee within ten (10) days after its notification to such grantee, in which case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its facilities during the open trench period. 
5.  Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance with state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and the cable operators, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law. 
6.  Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated costs. 
7.  In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the city reserves the right to limit the number of drop cables per residence, or to require that the drop cable(s) be utilized only by the cable operator selected by the resident to provide service. 
8.  The city reserves the right to grant an encroachment permit to a cable franchisee applicant to install conduit and/or cable in anticipation of the granting of a franchise. Such installations shall be at the applicant's risk, with no recourse against the city in the event the pending franchise application is not granted. The city may require an applicant to provide a separate trench for its conduit and/or cable, at the applicant's cost. The construction of such separate trench, if provided, shall be coordinated with, and subject to, the developer's overall construction schedule.

D.  In the event the council finds that the material violations alleged in the notice to grantee exist and that grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the council may impose one or more of the remedies provided in this chapter and the franchise agreement as it, in its discretion, deems appropriate under the circumstances.

A.  In the event that the use of any property of grantee within the public rights-of-way is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned that franchise property.

B.  Grantor, upon such terms as grantor may impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from grantor and shall restore any affected street to its former state at the time such facilities and equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles or attachments. Grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the public ways, public places, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this chapter and the security fund as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by grantee with the terms and conditions of this section.

Prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy or final inspection for the project, the applicant shall submit to the recycling plan compliance official documentation that the diversion requirement for the project has been met. The diversion requirement shall be that the applicant has diverted at least fifty (50) percent of the total construction and demolition debris generated by the project via reuse or recycling, unless the applicant has been granted an infeasible exemption pursuant to subsection E of this section, in which case the diversion requirement shall be the maximum feasible diversion rate established by the recycling plan compliance official for the project. This documentation shall include all of the following: 
a.  Receipts from the vendor or facility which collected or received each material showing the actual weight or volume of that material; 
b.  A copy of the previously approved recycling plan for the project adding the actual volume or weight of each material diverted and landfilled;

2.  Weighing of Wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all construction and demolition debris diverted or landfilled are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all construction and demolition debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose. 
3.  Determination of Compliance. The recycling plan compliance official shall review the information submitted under subsection B of this section and determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement, as follows: 
a.  Full Compliance. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirements applicable to the project, he or she shall approve the recycling plan and inform the building department that a certificate of occupancy or final inspection can be issued. 
b.  Substantial Compliance. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that the diversion requirement has not been achieved, he or she shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this section. In making this determination, the recycling plan compliance official shall consider the availability of markets for the construction and demolition debris landfilled, the size of the project, and the documented efforts of the applicant to divert construction and demolition debris. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this section, he or she shall approve the recycling plan and inform the building department that a certificate of occupancy or final inspection can be issued. 
c.  Noncompliance. If the recycling plan determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this section, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by subsection A of this section within the required time period, then the applicant shall pay a penalty in the amount calculated as two percent of the total project valuation. After payment of the penalty, the compliance official shall inform the building department that a certificate of occupancy or final inspection can be issued.

5.  Final Approval. All conditions of this section shall be met prior to final approval by the building department. 
E.  Infeasible Exemption. 
1.  Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the recycling plan required under subsection B of this section. The applicant shall indicate on the recycling plan the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement. 
2.  Meeting with Recycling Plan Compliance Official. The recycling plan compliance official shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. The recycling plan compliance official may request that staff from the San Luis Obispo County integrated waste management authority or designee attend this meeting or may require the applicant to attend a separate meeting with San Luis Obispo County integrated waste management authority staff. Based on the information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, San Luis Obispo county integrated waste management authority staff or designee, the recycling plan compliance official shall determine whether it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement. 
3.  Granting of Exemption. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the recycling plan submitted by the applicant. The recycling plan compliance official shall return a copy of the recycling plan to the applicant marked "Approved for Infeasible Exemption" and shall notify the building department that the recycling plan has been approved. 
4.  Denial of Exemption. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have thirty (30) days to resubmit a recycling plan form in full compliance with subsection B of this section. If the applicant fails to resubmit the recycling plan, or if the resubmitted recycling plan does not comply with subsection B of this section, the recycling plan compliance official shall deny the recycling plan in accordance with subsection (C)(2) of this section.

Chapter 9.16 - NOISE 
Sections: 

9.16.010 - Noise standards. 
    This chapter establishes standards for acceptable exterior and interior noise levels and describes how noise is to be measured. These standards are intended to protect persons from excessive noise levels, which are detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety and contrary to the public interest because they can: interfere with sleep, communication, relaxation and the full enjoyment of one's property; contribute to hearing impairment and a wide range of adverse physiological stress conditions; and adversely affect the value of real property. It is the intent of this chapter to protect persons from excessive levels of noise within or near various residential development and other specified noise-sensitive land uses. 
(Prior code § 5-21.01) 
9.16.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter: 
    "A-weighted sound level" means the sound level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighting network (scale) at slow meter response. The unit of measurement is referred to as "dB." 
    "Ambient noise level" means the composite of noise from all sources excluding the alleged offensive noise. In this context, the ambient noise level is the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location for a specified time of the day or night. 
    "Decibel, dB" means a unit for measuring the amplitude of a sound, equal to twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is twenty (20) micropascals. 
    "Equivalent Sound Level (Leq)" means the sound level containing the same total energy as a time varying signal over a given sample period. Leq is typically computed over one, eight and twenty-four (24) hour sample periods. 
    "Impulsive sound or noise" means sound of short duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. Examples of impulsive sound include explosions, hammering and discharge of firearms. 
    "Intruding noise levels" means the sound level created, caused, maintained or originating from an alleged offensive source, measured in decibels, at a specified location while the alleged offensive source is in operation. 
    "Noise" means any sound that can be measured on a A-weighted sound level meter. 
    "Simple tone noise" means any noise which is distinctly audible as a single pitch (frequency) or set of pitches as determined by the city. 
    "Sound level meter" means any instrument for the measurement of sound levels, which meets or exceeds the American National Standard Institute Standard S1.4-1971 for Type 1 or Type 2 sound level meters, or an instrument and the associated recording and analyzing equipment which will provide equivalent data.

_____
(Date) 
NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required by Arroyo Grande Municipal Code Chapter 9.28 to, at your sole expense, remove or paint over the graffiti in existence on the property located at (address), which is visible to public view, by (date). If you fail to do so, the city or its agents will enter your property and remove or paint over the graffiti. The cost of such removal and/or painting will be assessed against you and your property, and such costs will constitute a lien upon such property until paid. 
You may request a hearing to contest this notice. To request a hearing, you must submit a written request to the police chief by (date). If a request is not received by this date by the police chief, the police chief shall have the authority to proceed with the abatement of the graffiti inscribed on your property without further notice or hearing, and at your expense. 
Your presence is not required at the hearing. In lieu of attendance, you may submit a sworn written statement executed under penalty of perjury, as to why you are not responsible for the removal of the graffiti, and/or assessment of costs of removal and/or painting. If you do not appear in person at the hearing, your sworn written statement as described will be considered as your sole testimony. 
C.  Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the police chief shall set a date and time for the hearing and notify the person requesting the hearing of the date, time, and location of the hearing. All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the police chief who shall hear all facts and testimony he/she deems pertinent. Said facts and testimony may include testimony on the location of the graffiti and the circumstances concerning its placement on the real or personal property. The police chief shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. After the hearing, the police chief shall serve notice of his/her written decision to the person requesting the hearing, or other affected parties, within ten (10) working days. 
D.  Any owner of the real or personal property on which graffiti is to be abated who is not satisfied with the decision of the police chief to abate said graffiti may appeal to the city manager or his/her designee. The written appeal must be filed with the city manager within ten (10) working days of service of the police chief's decision. The city manager, or his/her designee, may uphold the order of the police chief to abate the graffiti granted under this chapter if the city manager, or his/her designee, determines that the graffiti is detrimental to the public safety or welfare. 
(Ord. No. 616, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2009) 
9.28.130 - Assessment and payment of costs. 
A.  Following abatement, the police chief shall send an invoice to the owner of the real or personal property upon which graffiti has been abated. The notice shall specify all graffiti abatement and eradication costs. 
B.  The total cost of graffiti abatement and eradication, including all administrative costs, shall be paid by the owner or other person in control of the real property or the owner of personal property upon which graffiti has been abated, within thirty (30) calendar days after service of the invoice. 
C.  Pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5, the total cost of abatement and eradication, including all administrative costs, shall constitute a special assessment against the property subject to the graffiti abatement, if not paid in full within thirty (30) days after service of the invoice. After the assessment is made, it shall constitute a lien on the property subject to the graffiti abatement. Such special assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedures and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. 
(Ord. No. 616, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2009) 
9.28.140 - Cost of abatement a personal obligation. 
    Instead of making the cost of abating a nuisance a special assessment against the property subject to the graffiti abatement, the city may make the cost the personal obligation of the property owner or other person creating, causing committing or maintaining the nuisance. In such a case, all of the procedures of this chapter apply except those specially related to assessment of the property. The property owner or person in control will remain responsible for all abatement and eradication costs until reimbursement is collected by the city from the person creating, causing, or committing the nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 616, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2009) 
9.28.150 - Alternative means of enforcement. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the city council from authorizing the city attorney to commence any other available civil or criminal proceedings to abate a public nuisance in addition to or alternative to proceedings set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 616, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2009)

A.  Pursuant to Section 53069.5 of the Government Code, the city may offer a reward of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) for any person or persons who furnish information, in whatever method that provides for adequate identification of the violator(s) which may include photo or video evidence, to the city's police department leading to the arrest and conviction, adjudication as a juvenile offender, or confession of any person for violation of Section 9.28.040 of this code or California Penal Code Section 594. In the event of multiple contributors of information, the reward amount shall be divided by the city in the manner it shall deem appropriate. For the purposes of this section, diversion of the offending violator to a community service program, or a plea bargain to a lesser offense, may constitute a conviction. 
B.  Moneys collected from penalties shall be deposited into the city's general fund, and those moneys may be utilized to pay for the monetary reward and graffiti control program. 
C.  Claims for rewards under this section shall be filed with the city clerk as are other claims against the city. Each claim shall: 
1.  Specifically identify the date, location and kind of property damaged or destroyed; 
2.  Identify the person who was convicted of or who confessed to violating Arroyo Grande Municipal Code Section 9.28.040 or California Penal Code Section 594;

4.  No claim for a reward shall be allowed unless an authorized representative of the city investigates and verifies the accuracy of the claim and recommends that it be allowed. The investigation must determine that the claimant's information was relevant and directly responsible for the arrest and conviction of the suspect. 
D.  The person committing the graffiti violation, and, if that person is not an emancipated minor, then the custodial parent or guardian of the minor shall be liable for any rewards paid pursuant to this section.

As described in the fee resolution, this tree planting fee shall be paid by each developer prior to issuance of a building permit. On an annual basis, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of developments. The revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate and special account, and such revenues, along with any interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to pay for the city's future purchase and planting of trees described in the resolution enacted pursuant to the above. The selection, purchase, planting and future maintenance of such trees shall be performed by the director. In lieu of the fee, at the election of the planning commission, the subdivider shall be responsible for the purchase, planting, maintenance and replacement, if necessary of such trees for twenty-four (24) months after planting and acceptance according to a uniform planting plan approved by the director. The subdivider may be required to post a bond, the amount to be determined by the planning commission, to assure faithful performance. The bond may be held by the city for a maximum of two years.

H.  The killing, removal or damaging, intentionally or accidentally, of any tree, because of development activity, shall result in a separate administrative penalty to be paid, through payment by person or persons causing such loss, to the city. The payment shall be the amount of the value of the tree, as set forth in the Manual for Plant Appraisers, published by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers, but in no event shall the payment be less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per tree. The intentional killing, removal or damaging of any tree, as a result of development activity, shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
I.  If the permit-granting authority approves the removal of any oak tree or other tree as defined in Section 12.16.020 when related to property development, the tree owner(s) of such tree(s) shall replace each tree removed at a three to one replacement ratio. The size, specie, and location of replacement trees shall be determined by the director, in writing, before the permit is issued. Replacement trees shall be maintained and cared for by the owner(s) when planted on his or her parcel. If not planted on the owner's parcel, the director may identify a site for planting replacement tree(s), and the city will be responsible for maintenance thereof. 
J.  In the event the permit-granting authority desires landmark designation for any tree, the permit-granting authority shall convey such recommendation to the city council via the planning commission for consideration and recommendation and shall withhold issuance of such permit until the city council has adopted a resolution conferring landmark designation. 
K.  In the event the city council adopts a resolution conferring landmark designation upon a tree(s) during the development process, a permit shall be issued only with condition that the designated tree(s) shall not be removed or disturbed. Failure to comply with this condition shall result in a misdemeanor. There will be a separate administrative penalty of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to the tree owner for each landmark tree removed, destroyed or killed as a result of construction or development activity, regardless of whether the removal was intentional. 
L.  All administrative penalties recovered by the city, pursuant to this chapter of the municipal code, shall be deposited in a city fund, the assets of which shall be used for tree planting, care and administration of this chapter of the municipal code. 
M.  Trees designated to remain on the tree removal plan shall be protected prior to and during construction by the owner(s), using the following measures: 
1.  Each tree or group of trees designated to remain shall be protected by an enclosure of a five-foot fence, prior to the beginning of construction. The fence shall be wooden, chain link, or plastic barricade fencing. The location of the fence is normally at the dripline of the tree, but it may adjusted or omitted with the director's written approval. 
2.  No parking of vehicles or equipment or storage of materials shall be permitted within the dripline of the trees designated to remain. 
3.  In the event the underground utilities must be placed within the dripline of the trees to remain, the utilities shall be installed by auguring at twenty-four (24) inches minimum depth or by hand trenching. If roots over one inch in diameter are encountered, the roots shall be preserved without injury. No machine trenching within a tree's dripline shall be permitted, unless authorized, in writing, by the director. 
4.  A performance bond may be required, in a form acceptable to the city and prior to issuance of an entitlement, to assure protection of trees on the site. The amount of any set bond shall be one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00), or the value of affected trees, whichever is greater, based on the Manual for Plant Appraisers, Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. The latest edition is to be available for review in the community development department. If, in the opinion of the certified arborist, no violation or damage has occurred during construction, the bond shall be returned upon final building inspection. However, if damage has occurred, the bond shall be held for three years and forfeited if, in the opinion of the certified arborist, permanent damage has occurred. 
5.  Failure to comply with tree preservation requirements shall result in the director issuing a stop work order until all requirements have been met. 
N.  Upon determination that a conditioned tree or landmark tree has died, been destroyed or removed as a result of construction or development activity, the council may stop further construction or development activity until the administrative penalty is paid. 
O.  When the city requires tree pruning, the tree service contractor performing the work shall use an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture.

13.07.020 - Water shortage emergency stages of action. 
A.  The provisions of this chapter provide for stages of action that will be undertaken in response to water supply shortages and related triggering conditions, consistent with the city of Arroyo Grande's Urban Water Management Plan. It provides for the imposition of regulations and restrictions, including but not limited to requirements to reduce consumption of water, that are necessary in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
    The stages of action have been created in recognition of the fact that the city's water supply consists of a combination of water from the Lopez Reservoir and groundwater sources, and that a variety of specific factors can result in the need to implement a stage of action, as well as the potential for unanticipated interruptions of local water deliveries, the water delivery system or the imposition of additional state mandated reductions in water use. 
B.  The provisions of this Chapter relating to emergency water shortage restrictions and regulations are in addition to the water conservation requirements contained in Section 13.05.030. Those water conservation requirements are permanent and this stage of action shall apply at all times and shall be known as Stage 0. 
C.  The other provisions of this chapter relating to additional stages of action shall be implemented and take effect upon adoption of a resolution by the city council as further provided in Section 13.07.030, based upon the recommendations of city staff and its analysis of the city's water supply conditions and the existence of triggering conditions, as further provided in this chapter. In addition to the permanent water conservation requirements that constitute Stage 0, the additional stages of action shall be referred to as a Stage 1 water shortage emergency, a Stage 1B water shortage emergency, or a Stage 2 water shortage emergency. 
D.  Upon adoption, resolutions providing for a stage of action shall remain in effect for the duration of the water shortage emergency conditions, but may be modified by the city council to impose additional measures to a stage of action as necessary to address the need to preserve the city's water supply to the maximum extent possible in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
E.  During a declared stage of action, if it is deemed in the city's interest in order to better monitor water usage, the billing period may be adjusted by city staff to provide for monthly billing, instead of bi-monthly billing. 
F.  Upon adoption of a resolution declaring a stage of action, the provisions of this chapter and any restrictions set forth in the resolution, shall apply to all persons using or consuming water provided by the city inside and outside of the city, regardless of whether any person using such water has a contract for water service with the city. 
G.  If any other provision of the Arroyo Grande Municipal Code, whether enacted prior to or subsequent to the enactment of this chapter, is inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall supersede and control for the duration of the declared water shortage emergency set forth in the resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 1, 2-14-2017) 
13.07.030 - Implementation of stages of action. 
    The stages of action may be implemented by the city council as follows: 
A.  Stage 1 water shortage emergency and historical use water restrictions. 
1.  After holding a noticed public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Water Code Section 350 et seq., the city council may, by resolution, declare a Stage 1 water shortage emergency based upon a determination that triggering conditions exist or there have been impacts to the city's water supply, and/or it has been determined that it is imminent that the city's water supply has or will become so limited that an emergency water shortage condition exists as far as the available water supply being less than projected demand necessitating the institution of reductions in water usage based upon historical use, as further set forth in subsection 2, below. 
    Triggering conditions may include, but not be limited to: a determination that the water level at the Lopez Reservoir is at or below fifteen thousand (15,000) acre feet; there have been six quarterly continuous events of sentry well level readings below the deep well index trigger level of seven and one-half feet; and/or the imposition of mandatory reductions in water use by the city by the state water resources control board. 
2.  Upon adoption of a Stage 1 water shortage emergency resolution, all residential customers will be assigned a baseline amount of water, based upon the amount of water used during the same billing period of the previous year prior to the adoption of the resolution. All residential customers shall reduce water usage by a percentage amount set forth in the resolution, which percentages may be modified or amended by the city council as deemed necessary and appropriate. The percentage of required conservation shall increase depending on the billing tier of the residential customer's water use as provided in the city's tiered water rate structure. The resolution shall include provisions for the imposition of mandatory financial penalties if the amount of water in each tier is exceeded, which penalties may also be modified or amended by the city council as deemed necessary and appropriate based upon a determination of the severity of the water shortage emergency. 
    The following shall be used as a general framework for the resolution establishing the baseline units for billing tiers and penalties, subject to such revisions deemed necessary in order to achieve the desired water savings: 
    Residential customers in Tier 1 shall be required to reduce consumption by the lowest percentage. Residential customers in Tier 2 shall be required to reduce consumption by a larger percentage than those in Tier 1. Residential customers in Tier 3 shall be required to reduce consumption by an even larger percentage than those in Tier 1 and Tier 2. For example, Tier 1 customers may initially be required to conserve ten (10) percent, Tier 2 customers twenty (20) percent and Tier 3 customers thirty (30) percent. As the emergency worsens, the city council may, by resolution, increase the percentage reduction deemed necessary in order to achieve the projected amount of water savings established as necessary. 
B.  Stage 1B Water Shortage Emergency-Implementation of additional restrictions based upon the existence of triggering conditions. 
1.  After holding a noticed public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Water Code Section 350 et seq., the city council may, by resolution, find and determine that failure to adopt and impose additional restrictions on water use and deny new or additional water service connections for projects that do not participate in a water demand offset program, would place the community in a condition that is dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of its citizens due to the severe impact on the city's water supply, if it is determined that any specified triggering conditions exist. 
    Based upon such a determination, the city council may declare a Stage 1B Water Shortage Emergency that will provide that when triggering conditions exist additional restrictions on water use, including but not limited to denial of new or additional water service connections for projects that do not participate in a water demand offset program, will be imposed in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community. 
    The resolution may provide that the certification by the city manager and public works director that the triggering conditions set forth in subsection 2 below exist, which shall result in the immediate imposition of additional regulations and restrictions on the use of water in order to provide for the protection of the public's health, safety and welfare, as set forth in the resolution. 
2.  If any one of the following water supply triggering conditions are determined to exist, the additional water use restrictions contained in subsection 4 below shall immediately be imposed. 
a.  The interruption of local water deliveries, the water delivery system or additional mandated reductions in water use by the state water resources control board. 
b.  The water level at the Lopez Reservoir is at or below ten thousand (10,000) acre feet. 
c.  There have been six quarterly continuous events of sentry well level readings in the Santa Maria Ground Water Basin below the deep well index trigger level of seven and one-half feet, or indications of sea water intrusion are detected. 
3.  In the event that any of the foregoing triggering conditions are determined to exist, the public works director and city manager shall certify to its existence, immediately notify the city council of such determination, post the certification of the existence of the condition on the city website, and make additional notifications to alert the public that the additional Stage 1B restrictions are being implemented. 
4.  The following additional regulations and restrictions shall apply in addition to the restriction imposed in the Stage 1 Water Shortage Emergency: 
a.  Irrigation of city-owned non-sports field turf areas shall be reduced to twenty-five (25) percent of the water used for such irrigation in a year as specified in the adopting resolution. 
b.  The required residential customer water reductions established in Stage 1 pursuant to Section A 2, above, shall be increased by five percent for each of the three water rate tiers. 
c.  There shall be no new or additional water connections for any project that does not have all required planning project approvals and entitlements at the time of the certification that a triggering condition exists. Smaller projects of less than four residential units or less than five thousand (5,000) sq. feet of commercial space shall be exempt from this restriction. Notwithstanding this restriction, development projects may continue to be processed. 
d.  The city council may provide that the restriction contained in subsection c. above, will not apply to any project that participates in the city's approved water demand offset program by providing water savings that offset their project's water demand by a ratio of 1:1.5. 
5.  The foregoing Stage 1B additional regulations and restrictions contained in this section shall no longer apply upon certification by the public works director and the city manager that the water level at the Lopez Reservoir is at or above fifteen thousand (15,000) acre feet and increasing, and none of the other triggering conditions exist, or upon a determination by the city council that these additional water use regulations and restrictions are no longer necessary to protect the city's water supply. 
C.  Stage 2 Water Shortage Emergency and Household Allocation Water Restrictions. 
1.  After holding a noticed public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Water Code Section 350 et seq., the city council may declare, by resolution, a Stage 2 Water Shortage Emergency based upon a determination that triggering conditions exist or that the projected city's water supply condition is or will become equal to or less than amounts that have been determined necessary to meet basic minimum household health and safety requirements, and restrictions and limits through the implementation of water allocations are necessary for continued water use that is reliable and sustainable by providing a minimum supply for the most essential purposes for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection during the emergency situation, in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
    Triggering conditions may include, but not be limited to: a determination that the water level at the Lopez Reservoir is at or below five thousand (5,000) acre feet; and/or seawater intrusion is occurring in the Santa Maria Groundwater Basin; and/or there has been a catastrophic or emergency interruption in the city's water supply. 
2.  Upon adoption of a Stage 2 Water Shortage Emergency, restrictions and limits shall be imposed through the implementation of household allocations of water units for residential customers. All residential customers will be allocated units of water deemed necessary for an average household size (one unit of water is equal to one hundred (100) cubic feet or seven hundred forty-eight (748) gallons). Any residential customer using over the assigned baseline unit amount may be subject to citation and shall be subject to the imposition of mandatory financial penalties, which shall be set forth in the resolution adopted by the city council and be based upon the severity of the water shortage emergency. Each household shall be allowed twelve (12) units of water per two month billing period (which is equivalent to one hundred fifty (150) gallons per household per day). Households with over five people will be allowed twenty (20) units of water per two-month billing period (two hundred fifty (250) gallons per day). Households with over seven people will be allowed twenty-eight (28) units of water per two-month billing period (three hundred fifty (350) gallons per day). The allocations contained herein may be adjusted by the city council by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 1, 2-14-2017) 
13.07.040 - Reserved. 
13.07.050 - Commercial properties and customers with irrigation meters. 
    During a Stage 1 Water Shortage Emergency commercial water customers shall not be subject to mandatory penalties for use except for those with irrigation meters as provided below. 
    Any customer with an irrigation meter account shall reduce water use by such percentages specified in the resolution declaring the water shortage emergency, which percentage reductions may be increased by the city council by resolution upon a determination that additional reductions are necessary. The resolution shall also establish mandatory financial penalties for failing to meet required water use reductions. 
    During a Stage 2 Water Shortage Emergency commercial water customers shall not use potable water for irrigation of outdoor landscaping. All irrigation meters shall be shut off and billing will be suspended. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 1, 2-14-2017) 
13.07.060 - Additional requirements and restrictions during Stage 1, Stage 1B or Stage 2 Water Shortage Emergency. 
    Upon adoption of a resolution declaring a Stage 1, Stage 1B or Stage 2 Water Shortage Emergency the following shall apply: 
1.  Commercial, industrial or irrigation meter customers shall immediately follow any directive issued or declared by the city's water department to conduct water use audits, prepare water conservation plans and immediately repair any identified water system leaks, including leaks attributable to faulty pipes or fixtures. Commercial customers shall not violate any other water use restrictions intended to preclude excessive water usage, as adopted by the city. 
2.  Residential customers shall not violate any water use/allocation or other water rationing regulation implemented by resolution of the city council, including such regulations intended to preclude excessive water usage and specifying maximum water usage limitations, as otherwise provided by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 1, 2-14-2017) 
13.07.070 - Adjustments in water consumption reduction amounts, and other exceptions. 
A.  During a declared water shortage emergency the director, upon application made in writing by a customer on a form promulgated by the water department and accompanied by supporting documentation, shall be authorized to modify the percentage of water consumption reduction that is required by the customer, upon the customer's production of substantial evidence demonstrating the existence of unusual circumstances, including but not limited to the household having been vacant during a portion of the comparison year billing period, resulting in the baseline water amount assigned to the household being lower than what would normally have been experienced. 
B.  The percentage of reduction in water consumption may also be adjusted if the existence of one or more of the following circumstances are shown and that are particular to that customer and which are not generally shared by other water department customers: 
1.  Failure to approve the requested exception would cause a condition having an adverse effect on the health, sanitation, fire protection, or safety of the customer. 
2.  Alternative restrictions to which the customer is willing to adhere are available that would achieve the same level of demand reduction as the restriction for which an exception is being sought and such alternative restrictions are enforceable by the water department. 
3.  Circumstances concerning the customer's property have changed since the implementation of the subject restriction warranting a change in the customer's water usage allocation or required percentage of reduction in consumption. 
C.  In order to qualify for an exception, a customer may be required at the director's determination, to first complete a self-water audit pursuant to standards and procedures promulgated by the water department. This audit shall be made part of the customer's exception application and water conservation measures indicated by the audit may be incorporated as conditions of approval to an exception in addition to any other conditions of approval imposed by the director in connection with the director's approval of the customer's exception application. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 1, 2-14-2017) 
13.07.080 - Water Shortage Appeals Board (WSAB). 
A.  Upon adoption of a resolution declaring a water shortage emergency, the utility billing adjustment committee shall be empowered to act as the water shortage appeal board (WSAB). Thereafter, the water shortage appeal board will remain available to convene for as long as the water shortage emergency remains in effect. 
B.  Any customer who considers an action taken by the director or an enforcement official under the provisions of this chapter, including action on adjustments to water consumption reduction amounts, and on exception application, or the assessment of administrative penalties which have been erroneously taken or issued, may appeal that action or penalty to the water shortage appeals board in the following manner: 
1.  The appeal shall be made in writing, shall state the nature of the appeal specifying the action or penalty that is being appealed and the basis upon which the action or penalty is alleged to be in error. Penalty appeals shall include a copy of the bill or any applicable notice of violation; 
2.  An appeal, to be effective, must be received by the director not later than ten business days following the date of the notice of violation or the date that the director took the action which is the subject of the appeal; 
3.  The director shall schedule the appeal for consideration by the WSAB. The WSAB shall hear the appeal within ninety (90) days of the date of the appeal and issue its decision within thirty (30) days of the date of the hearing; 
4.  In ruling on appeals, the WSAB shall strictly apply the provisions of this chapter, and shall not impose or grant terms and conditions not authorized by this chapter. 
5.  Decisions of the WSAB shall be subject to appeal to the city council in accordance with the procedures in Chapter 1.12 of this code, including the requirement that decisions be first taken up with the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 682, § 1, 2-14-2017) 
13.07.090 - Penalties and enforcement. 
A.  Penalties. The purpose of the mandatory penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter and set forth in a resolution of the city council declaring a water shortage emergency is to assure compliance by the customer through the imposition of increasingly significant penalties so as to create a meaningful incentive to reduce water use. In acknowledgment of the fact that the city's water is scarce and irreplaceable commodity and that this chapter is intended to equitably distribute that commodity among water department customers and to assure that, to the extent feasible, city water is conserved and used only for purposes deemed necessary for public health and safety, such mandatory penalties are not to be construed as creating a "water pricing" structure pursuant to which customers may elect to pay for additional water at significantly higher rates. 
B.  A customer's repeated use of excessive water during a water shortage emergency may result in criminal prosecution as a misdemeanor, and may result in the installation of a flow restriction device or disconnection of the customer's property from the city's water service system at the customer's cost, as further set forth herein. Flow restriction devices shall not be installed on residences that have fire sprinkler systems. 
C.  Misdemeanor. In addition to, and completely separate from, the civil penalties for excessive water use, any person who knowingly and willfully violates the provisions of this chapter during a water shortage emergency shall be guilty of a criminal misdemeanor as provided in the general penalty provisions of this code. In accordance with Section 1.16.010, such misdemeanor violations may, at the discretion of the city attorney, be initially charged or subsequently prosecuted as an infraction. All previous attempts by the city to obtain compliance by the defendant may be introduced as evidence of the offender's knowledge and willfulness. 
D.  Discontinuing Service. In addition to any penalties, misdemeanor criminal prosecution and the installation of a water flow restrictor, during a water shortage emergency the director may disconnect a customer's water service for willful violations of mandatory restrictions and regulations in this chapter and Chapter 13.05. Upon disconnection of water service, a written notice shall be served upon the customer which shall state the time, place, and general description of the prohibited or restricted activity and the method by which reconnection can be made. 
E.  Cost of Flow Restrictor and Disconnecting Service. A person or entity that as a result of violations of this chapter has a flow restrictor installed or water service disconnected is responsible for payment of charges for installing and/or removing the flow-restricting device and for disconnecting and/or reconnecting service in accordance with the city's fee schedule then in effect. The charge for installing and/or removing any flow restricting device must be paid before the device is removed. Nonpayment will be subject to the same remedies as nonpayment of basic water rates.

Chapter 13.16 - CROSS-CONNECTIONS 
Sections: 

13.16.010 - Purposes. 
    The purposes of the provisions of this chapter are: 
A.  To protect the public water supply against actual or potential cross-connections by isolating within the premises contamination or pollution that may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized cross-connection on the premises; 
B.  To eliminate existing connections between drinking water systems and other sources of water that are not approved as safe and potable for human consumption; 
C.  To eliminate cross-connections between drinking water systems and other sources of water or process water used for any purpose whatsoever which jeopardize the safety of the drinking water supply; 
D.  To prevent the making of cross-connections in the future; 
E.  To encourage the exclusive use of public sources of water supply; and 
F.  To protect the drinking water supply within the premises where plumbing defects or cross-connections may endanger the drinking water supply available on the premises. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to recognize that there are varying degrees of hazards and to apply the principle that the degree of protection should be commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
(Prior code § 6-9.01) 
13.16.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
    "Air-gap separation" means a physical break between a supply pipe and a receiving vessel. The air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically above the top rim of the vessel, but shall in no case be less than one inch. 
    "Approved check valve" means a check valve meeting the specifications and approval of a recognized, approved testing agency for back-flow prevention devices. 
    "Approved double check valve assembly" means an assembly of at least two independently acting approved check valves, including tightly closing shut-off valves, on each side of the check valve assembly and suitable leak detector drains plus connections available for testing the water tightness of each valve. The entire assembly shall be made in the factory of the manufacturer and shall meet the specifications and approval of a recognized, approved testing agency for back-flow prevention devices. To be approved, these devices shall be readily accessible for maintenance testing. 
    "Approved reduced pressure principle back-flow prevention device" means a device approved by a recognized and approved testing agency for back-flow prevention devices. The entire assembly shall be made in the factory of the manufacturer and shall incorporate two or more check valves and an automatically differential relief valve located between the two cheeks, two shut-off valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves less than the pressure on the public supply side of the device. At the cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the check valves shall be less than the supplied pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby providing an air-gap in the device.

These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the water user whenever they are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and submitted to the department. 
(Prior code § 6-9.06) 
13.16.070 - Qualification and certification of persons to inspect and maintain back-flow prevention devices. 
A.  No person shall be qualified to inspect and maintain back-flow prevention devices unless his or her qualifications have been established to the satisfaction of the County of San Luis Obispo Environmental Health Services Division as set forth in this section. To determine the qualifications of any person to inspect and maintain back-flow prevention devices, the department shall have the authority to conduct examinations as necessary. Upon the successful completion of such examination and such training as the county shall prescribe, the person so examined shall receive from the county a certificate of competence. Any limitations or conditions imposed by the department on the examinee in the inspection and maintenance of back-flow prevention devices shall be stated upon the face of the certificate of competence issued to the examinee. The department shall make available to consumers a list of persons qualified to inspect and maintain back-flow prevention devices.

B.  Water systems for fighting fires, derived from a supply that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use, shall, wherever practicable, be kept wholly separate from drinking water pipelines and equipment. In cases where the domestic water system is used for both drinking and fire fighting purposes, approved back-flow prevention devices shall be installed to protect such individual drinking water lines as are not used for fire fighting purposes. The users of such drinking water systems shall be further protected as prescribed by the health departments of the state and county. 
C.  Potable water pipelines connected to equipment for industrial processes or operations shall be disconnected therefrom if practicable. Where disconnection is not practicable, an approved back-flow prevention device, the type or kind depending on the degree of hazard, shall be located in the feedline to the process piping or equipment beyond the last point from which drinking water may be taken. In the event the particular processed liquid is especially corrosive or is apt to prevent reliable action of the back-flow prevention device, an air-gap separation shall be provided. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced whenever they are found to be defective. Records of tests, repairs and replacement shall be kept and submitted to the department. 
D.  Sewage pumps and stormwater pumps shall not have priming connections directly off any drinking water system unless the drinking water system is protected by an air-gap, and no connection shall exist between the drinking water system and any other piping, equipment or tank in any sewage treatment plant, sewage pumping station, or stormwater pumping station. 
E.  Back-flow protection by an approved back-flow protection device operating under the reduced pressure principle shall be provided on each drinking water outlet used for supplying ships or other vessels at piers or waterfronts. These devices shall be located where they will prevent the return of water from any ship or vessel into another adjacent ship or vessel or into the public water system. 
F.  Where the premises contain dual or multiple water systems and piping, the exposed portions of pipelines shall be painted, banded or marked at sufficient intervals to distinguish clearly which water is safe for drinking purposes and which is not safe. All outlets from other than approved water supply systems shall be posted as being unsafe for drinking purposes. All outlets intended for drinking purposes shall be plainly marked to indicate that fact. 
(Ord. 576 § 31, 2005; prior code § 6-9.09) 
13.16.110 - Violations-Penalties. 
    The city shall have the authority to immediately discontinue service to any premises where cross-connections or other hazards to the water system are found to exist and shall not again render service to the premises until such conditions are eliminated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Any consumer who wilfully violates any of the provisions of this chapter or alters, bypasses or renders inoperative any back-flow prevention device installed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to immediate discontinuance of water service, be subject to the penalties prescribed in Chapter 1.16 of this code. Service shall not again be rendered until such violation of noncompliance has been corrected.

(Ord. No. 660, § 2(Exh. A), 2-25-2014) 
13.24.040 - Grading permit exemptions. 
    Note: While the activities under this section are exempted from a grading permit for the purposes of this city's ordinance, the owner and/or applicant should understand that permits may be required by other regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Regional Water Quality Control Board, Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or the California Department of Forestry (Cal Fire). Additionally, grading projects involving work within a state or county right-of-way may require encroachment permit approval. 
    No person shall do any land disturbance work without first obtaining a permit from the director of community development. A grading permit shall be obtained where grading is to occur meeting the definition set forth in Section 13.24.050 (grading). Activities that do not constitute grading as defined in this chapter, or are exempt from grading permits, may be subject to other applicable sections in this ordinance. This includes requirements, such as preparation and approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan, drainage plan, and/or stormwater pollution prevention plan. In granting any permit in compliance with this chapter, the director of community development and, where provided, the director of public works, may impose conditions as necessary. These conditions may include requiring a licensed contractor to perform the work or a licensed professional (e.g. civil engineer, geotechnical engineer, etc.) to prepare plans or technical reports in order to prevent creation of a nuisance or a hazard to public health, public safety, or public or private property, or to assure conformity to the city's general plan. The following grading does not require a grading permit. Exempt grading activities must employ appropriate sedimentation and erosion control measures: 
A.  Isolated area: Grading in an isolated, self-contained area if there is no danger to private or public property; 
B.  Emergency work: Work necessary to preserve life or property; provided, however, that when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report the pertinent facts relating to the work to the director of community development within fifteen (15) days after commencement of the work and shall thereafter obtain a permit pursuant to Section 13.24.050 and perform such work as may be determined by the director of community development to be reasonably necessary to correct any erosion or conditions with a potential to cause erosion as a result of the emergency work; 
C.  Excavation: An excavation which does not exceed fifty (50) cubic yards and is less than one foot in depth, does not create a cut slope higher than five feet and steeper than two to one (2:1); 
D.  Fill: A fill containing only permitted materials less than one foot deep, placed on natural terrain slope flatter than five to one (5:1), and does not exceed fifty (50) cubic yards on any one site, including stockpiles, does not alter or obstruct a drainage course, will not be used for structural support or roadways and the area graded or filled does not exceed eleven thousand (11,000) square feet (one-quarter acre). This exemption shall not apply to a fill within a riparian zone; 
E.  Basements and footings: An excavation below finished grade for basements and footings of a building, retaining wall or other structure authorized by a valid building permit. This shall not exempt any fill except as provided under subsection D of this section, made with the material from such excavation or exempt any excavation having an unsupported height greater than five feet after the completion of such structures; 
F.  Cemeteries: Cemetery graves; excavation, or fill within a property used or to be used for cemetery purposes is exempt. Grading that is intended to support structures or that will affect natural drainage patterns do not fall under this exemption; 
G.  Refuse disposal: Refuse, individual and/or community sewage disposal sites controlled pursuant to other regulations; 
H.  Wells and utilities: Excavations for wells, tunnels or utilities; 
I.  Exploratory investigations: Excavations under the direction of a soils engineer or engineering geologist where such excavation is to be returned to the original condition within forty-five (45) days after the start of work; 
J.  Clearing an area of eleven thousand (11,000) square feet (one-quarter acre) or less on five percent slopes or less; 
K.  Agricultural: Normal routine farming activities necessary to manage land, crops and/or animals for food production; 
L.  Mining, quarrying, excavating, processing, stockpiling of rock, sand, gravel, aggregate or clay where established and provided for by law, provided such operations are conditioned by other permits to preclude discharge of sediments offsite and provided such operations do not affect the lateral support or increase the stresses or pressure upon any adjacent or contiguous property; 
M.  Grading activities shall receive all necessary approvals from other city, state, or federal agencies, regardless of whether the activity is exempt under this chapter; 
N.  Activities exempted under this section are still required to incorporate all reasonable measures to ensure against erosion and sedimentation both during and after such activities. In all cases, any grading activities which could result in a hazardous condition are not exempt from grading permit requirements. A hazardous condition exists when activities create a hazard to life and limb, endanger property, adversely affect the safety, use or stability of a public right-of-way or drainage channel, or create a significant environmental impact. 
(Ord. No. 660, § 2(Exh. A), 2-25-2014) 
13.24.050 - Grading permit requirements. 
    A grading permit is required in any of the following cases, unless the project qualifies for an exemption or constitutes agricultural grading as set forth in Section 13.24.040:

4.  Temporary Stockpile. Soil stockpiled upon a land area for future site development or for temporary storage as set forth in Section 13.24.080. 
    Vegetation removal is calculated based on the total area of a site which will lack soil cover (i.e. "bare soil") at any given time. Areas subject to previous vegetation removal are not included in this calculation where permanent revegetation has already achieved a minimum of seventy (70) percent coverage. 
    All projects subject to a grading permit must submit an erosion and sediment control plan which includes the rationale used for selecting BMPs. The erosion and sediment control plan may be substituted by a SWPPP if the project requires one. The erosion and sediment control plan must require operators of construction sites to minimize the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 through the installation, implementation or maintenance of BMPs consistent with the California Storm Water Quality Association (CASQA) BMP Handbook or equivalent. 
    Note: The grading thresholds specified in subsections 1 and 2 above are to be measured cumulatively for each project. A project may not be broken down into smaller components with the intention of avoiding a grading permit. Activities progressing towards a common endeavor are considered a single project.

13.24.070 - Design standards for grading. 
A.  Grading Standards. 
1.  Excavation Standards. All excavations are to be conducted in compliance with the provisions of Section J106 of the California Building Code and the following standards: 
a.  No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the following conditions. 
i.  The director of community development may permit an excavation to be made with a cut face steeper than two horizontal to one vertical if the applicant provides a slope stability analysis prepared by a geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist that the material making up the slope of the excavation and the underlying earth material is capable of standing on a steeper slope, and a certified soil and erosion control specialist or other qualified professional indicates, in writing, that either it is feasible to mitigate erosion and sedimentation impacts and that successful revegetation of the site can be accomplished or that due to the nature or composition of the cut slope, erosion and sedimentation measures and revegetation are unnecessary. 
ii.  A retaining wall or other approved support which also mitigates visual impacts of the device is provided to support the face of the excavation. 
b.  The director of community development may require an excavation to be made with cut face flatter in slope than two horizontal to one vertical if a slope stability analysis or other appropriate method of review indicates that the material in which the excavation is to be made is such that the flatter cut slope is necessary for stability, safety, or to prevent erosion and sedimentation and stormwater impacts. 
c.  No cut slope shall exceed a height of twenty-five (25) feet without intervening terraces having a minimum width of six feet. These terraces shall be vertically spaced at intervals of twenty-five (25) feet except that for slopes less than forty (40) feet in vertical height the terrace shall be approximately at mid-height. Suitable access shall be provided to permit cleaning and maintenance. The director of community development may modify this requirement because of geologic or other special conditions. 
d.  The border of all cut slopes shall be rounded off to a minimum radius of five feet to blend with the natural terrain. 
e.  All cut slopes shall be within parcels under common ownership unless written permission is granted by the adjacent owner. 
2.  Fill standards. All fills are to be conducted in compliance with the provisions of Section J107 of the California Building Code Appendix J and the following standards: 
a.  No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical, except under one or more of the following conditions: 
i.  A retaining wall or other approved support is provided to support the face of the fill which also mitigates visual impacts of the device. 
ii.  The director of community development may permit a fill to be made which creates an exposed surface steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) if a geotechnical engineering report demonstrates that slope stability will be ensured. The geotechnical engineer shall certify that the strength characteristics of the material to be used in the fill are such as to produce a safe and stable slope and that the areas on which the fill is to be placed are suitable to support the fill. Additionally, a certified soil and erosion control specialist or other qualified professional shall indicate in writing that it is feasible to prevent erosion and sedimentation impacts, and successful revegetation of the site can be accomplished. All such reports are subject to the approval of the director of community development. 
b.  The director of community development may require that fill be constructed with an exposed surface flatter than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) if a slope stability analysis or other appropriate method of review indicates that such flatter surface is necessary for stability, safety, or to prevent erosion and sedimentation impacts. 
c.  Unless specified as a non-structural land reclamation, erosion control, or agricultural fill, all fills shall be placed, compacted, inspected, and tested in compliance with the following provisions: 
i.  The natural ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, non-complying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable materials. The surface shall be scarified to provide a bond with the new fill and where slopes are steeper than five horizontal to one vertical (5:1) and the height is greater than five feet, by benching into sound bedrock or other competent material as determined by the soils engineer. The bench under the toe of a fill on a slope steeper than five horizontal to one vertical (5:1) shall be at least ten (10) feet wide. The area beyond the toe of fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a paved drain shall be provided. When fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the toe of fill shall be at least ten (10) feet wide, but the cut shall be made before placing the fill. The soils engineer, engineering geologist, or both, shall certify that the bench is a suitable foundation for the proposed fill. 
ii.  Except as otherwise permitted by the director of community development, no rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than six inches shall be buried or placed in fills. No organic material shall be permitted in structural fills. The director of community development may permit placement of larger rock when the soils engineer properly devises a method of placement, continuously inspects its placement, and approves the fill stability. The following conditions shall also apply: 
(a)  Prior to issuance of the grading permit, potential rock disposal areas shall be identified on the grading plan. 
(b)  Rock sizes greater than six inches in maximum dimension shall be ten (10) feet or more below grade, measured vertically. 
(c)  Rocks shall be placed so as to assure filling of all voids with well-graded soil. 
iii.  A fill shall be spread in a series of horizontal lifts as specified by the geotechnical engineer or other approved professional approved by the director of community development. The distribution of material throughout each layer shall be free of lenses, pockets or layers of material differing substantially in texture or gradation from the surrounding material. All material shall be compacted into a fill of uniform moisture and density as specified in subsection A.2.c.iv. 
iv.  All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of ninety (90) percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D 1557-(latest edition) or other approved testing method giving equivalent test results. Field density shall be determined by ASTM D 1556-(latest edition) or other equivalent methods approved by the director of community development. 
v.  A field density test, as herein provided, shall be taken for each twenty-four (24) inches of fill, or portion thereof, measured vertically from the lowest point of the area to be filled, and for each two hundred (200) cubic yards of fill placed unless a variation is recommended by the soils engineer and approved by the director of community development. In addition, in the case of a subdivision, field density tests shall be taken on lots which receive fill based upon the recommendations of a soils engineer. 
vi.  All fills regulated by this chapter shall be tested for relative compaction by a qualified geotechnical testing agency. Final reports, including a letter certifying compliance with the terms of this chapter, and the grading permit, setting forth densities, relative compaction and other fill characteristics shall be prepared and signed by a geotechnical engineer. This report shall be submitted to and approved by the director before any final approval of the fill is given and before any foundation construction begins except for the digging of trenches and placing of reinforcing steel. 
(a)  Fills toeing out on natural slopes which are steeper than two horizontal to one vertical shall not be permitted unless evaluated and approved by a geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist. 
(b)  The border of fill slopes shall be rounded off to a minimum radius of five feet to blend with the natural terrain. 
3.  Grading Setback Standards. Cut and fill slopes shall be set back from site boundaries in compliance with the provisions of Section J108 of the 2013 California Building Code Appendix J and the following standards:

Figure No. 2
a.  General. Setback dimensions shall be horizontal distances measured perpendicular to the site boundary. Setback dimensions shall be as shown in Figure 1. 
b.  Stream and Riparian Setback. Tops and toes of cut and/or filled slopes shall be set back far enough to prevent encroachment upon streams, flood plains, or channels, or body of standing water to provide and maintain an undisturbed protective strip between the grading and the riparian corridor. This strip shall have sufficient filter capacity to prevent degradation of water quality, as determined by the erosion and sediment control specialist and approved by the building official. If it is determined that the filter capacity of the protective strip is insufficient, or development activity will encroach upon riparian zones, additional setback distance and/or erosion control practices may be required. 
c.  Retaining Walls. Retaining walls, when keyed into stable foundations and capable of sustaining the design loads, may be used to reduce the required cut and fill setbacks when recommended by the civil or soils engineer, or engineering geologist and approved by the building official. 
d.  Top of Cut Slope. The top of the cut slopes shall not be closer to a site boundary line than one-fifth of the vertical height of cut with a minimum of two feet and a maximum of ten (10) feet. The setback may need to be increased for any required interceptor drains or maintenance easements. The director may approve adjustments as a condition of the permit, as required by individual site conditions. 
e.  Toe of Fill Slope. The toe of fill slopes shall not be closer to the site boundary line than one-half the height of the slope with a minimum of two feet and a maximum of twenty (20) feet. Where a fill slope is to be located near the site boundary and the adjacent off-site property is developed, or site conditions warrant, special precautions shall be incorporated in the work as the director of community development deems necessary to protect the adjoining property from damage as a result of such grading. These precautions shall include, but are not limited to the following: 
i.  Additional setbacks. 
ii.  Provisions for retaining or slough walls. 
iii.  Mechanical or vegetative treatment of the fill slope to minimize erosion. 
iv.  Provisions for the control of surface waters. 
v.  Provisions for maintenance access. 
f.  Modification of Slope Location. The director of community development may approve alternate setbacks. The director of community development may require an investigation and recommendation by a qualified engineer, engineering geologist, or erosion control specialist to demonstrate that the intent of this section has been satisfied. 
g.  Distance From Property Line. No cut or fill shall be made which is sufficiently close to the property line to endanger any adjoining public or private property or structures without supporting and protecting such property or structures from any settling, cracking, or other damage which might result. 
h.  Other Restrictions and/or Minimums. Other requirements may also be increased or relaxed upon review by the building official if he or she finds the deviations consistent with safety and stability and to provide access for slope maintenance and drainage. 
4.  Landform Alterations Within Public View Corridors. Grading, vegetation removal, and other landform alterations shall be minimized on sites located within areas determined by the director of community development to be a public view corridor from collector or arterial roads. Where feasible, contours of finished grading are to blend with adjacent natural terrain to achieve a consistent grade and appearance. 
5.  Grading Near Watercourses. Grading, dredging or diking shall not alter any intermittent or perennial stream, or natural body of water shown on any USGS 7-1/2 minute map, except as permitted through approval of a city drainage plan and a streambed alteration permit from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued under Sections 1601 or 1602 of the Fish and Wildlife Code. Watercourses shall be protected as follows: 
a.  Watercourses shall not be obstructed unless an alternate drainage facility is approved. 
b.  Fills placed within watercourses shall have suitable protection against erosion during flooding. 
c.  Grading equipment shall not cross or disturb channels containing live streams without siltation control measures approved by the director of community development in place. 
d.  Excavated materials shall not be deposited or stored in or alongside a watercourse where the materials can be washed away by high water or stormwater runoff. 
(Ord. No. 660, § 2(Exh. A), 2-25-2014)

(Ord. No. 660, § 2(Exh. A), 2-25-2014) 
13.24.090 - Design standards for drainage. 
A.  Drainage Standards. Site development shall have no adverse impacts on adjacent and downstream locations. If adverse impacts are identified, off-site erosion, sediment and flood control improvements to the drainage way will be required to eliminate the adverse impacts. Designs for site area drainage and terraces shall be consistent with the low impact development (LID) requirements set by the RWQCB and the following minimum standards: 
1.  Design and Construction. Drainage systems and facilities subject to drainage plan review and approval that are to be located in existing or future public rights-of-way are to be designed and constructed as set forth in the latest edition of the public works department's public improvement standards, or as per the project's conditions of approval. Applicants may request an adjustment pursuant to the public improvement standards in order to allow for a design that is more compliant with LID practices. Other systems and facilities subject to drainage plan review and approval are to be designed in accordance with good engineering practices. The design of drainage facilities in new land divisions and other new development subject to minor use permit or conditional use permit approval shall maximize groundwater recharge through on-site or communitywide stormwater infiltration measures. Examples of such measures include constructed wetlands, vegetated swales or filter strips, small percolation ponds, subsurface infiltration basins, infiltration wells, and recharge basins. Where possible, recharge basins shall be designed to be available for recreational use. 
2.  Natural Channels and Runoff. Proposed projects are to include design provisions to retain natural drainage patterns and, when required, limit peak runoff to pre-development levels. To the maximum extent feasible, all drainage courses shall be retained in, or enhanced to appear in, a natural condition, without channelization for flood control. On downhill sites, encourage drainage easements on lower properties so that drainage can be released on the street or other appropriate land area below. 
3.  Best Management Practices (BMPs). All new development subject to drainage plan review shall use BMPs to address polluted runoff. BMPs shall be consistent with the guidance found in documents such as the LID Handbook. Such measures shall include, but not be limited to: minimizing the use of impervious surfaces (e.g., installing pervious driveways and walkways); directing runoff from roofs and drives to vegetative strips before it leaves the site; and/or managing runoff on the site (e.g., percolation basins); and other low impact design (LID) techniques. The installation of vegetated roadside drainage swales shall be encouraged and, if used, calculated into BMP requirements. The combined set of BMPs shall be designed to treat stormwater runoff up to and including the eighty-fifth-percentile storm event. 
4.  Runoff Volume. Runoff conveyance systems shall be capable of carrying the computed runoff volume from a twenty-five-year frequency storm or greater if deemed necessary by the director of community development. This may be reduced to a ten-year storm for small watersheds. 
5.  Interceptors. Concrete ditches, bio-swales or other approved methods capable of intercepting surface runoff waters shall be installed along the top of all cut slopes where the tributary drainage area has a slope ten (10) percent or greater and a horizontal projection greater than forty (40) feet. Interceptor drains shall be paved with a minimum of three inches of concrete or gunite and reinforced. They shall have a minimum depth of twelve (12) inches and a minimum paved width of thirty (30) inches measured horizontally across the drain. The slope of drain shall be approved by the director of community development. Energy dissipaters may be required by the director of community development. 
6.  Berms. Berms or drainage divides at least one foot high and three feet wide at the base shall be constructed at the top of all fill slopes where runoff would be directed towards the top of fill. Berms, ditches, interceptor drains, or swales shall be constructed at the top of cut and filled slopes for protection against water runoff. Paved interceptor drains shall be installed along the top of all cut slopes where the tributary drainage area above slopes towards the cut and has a drainage path greater than forty (40) feet measured horizontally. 
7.  Over Side Drains. Over side drains shall be of concrete or corrugated metal pipe having a diameter required by runoff calculations, but not less than eight inches, and shall be aligned so as to minimize velocity at discharge points. Alternate designs, such as LID methods, approved by the director of community development may be permitted. 
8.  Inlets. Inlets shall be constructed of galvanized iron, or approved equivalent, and shall be provided with overflow structures. 
9.  Outlets. Outlet structures shall be provided with approved velocity reducers, diversion walls, rip-rap, concrete aprons or similar energy dissipaters where necessary and aligned to minimize downstream erosion and reasonably maximize recharge at discharge points, and shall be approved by the director of community development. 
10.  Culverts. Culvert size and materials shall be determined by the civil engineer in accordance with standard design criteria and as approved by the building official. Minimum diameter shall be eighteen (18) inches. 
11.  Terraces. Terraces at least six feet in width shall be established at not more than thirty-foot vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes to control surface drainage and debris except that where only one terrace is required, it shall be at mid-height. For cut or fill slopes greater than sixty (60) feet and up to one hundred twenty (120) feet in vertical height, one terrace at approximately mid-height shall be twelve (12) feet in width. Terrace widths and spacing for cut and fill slopes greater than one hundred twenty (120) feet in height shall be designed by the civil engineer and approved by the director of community development. Suitable access shall be provided to permit proper cleaning and maintenance. Swales or ditches on terraces shall have a minimum gradient of five percent and must be paved with reinforced concrete not less than three inches in thickness or an approved equal paving. They shall have a minimum depth at the deepest point of one foot and a minimum paved width of five feet. A single run of swale or ditch shall not collect runoff from a tributary area exceeding thirteen thousand (13,000) square feet (projected) without discharging into a down drain. 
12.  Dispersal Structures. An approved drainage dispersal structure shall be constructed wherever it is necessary to convert channel flow to sheet flow. 
13.  Sensitive Habitat and Groundwater Protection. Runoff from roads and development shall not adversely affect sensitive habitat, groundwater resources and downstream areas, and shall be treated to remove floatable trash, heavy metals and chemical pollutants as necessary prior to discharge into surface or groundwater. 
14.  Groundwater Recharge Methods. New development shall identify all methods to enhance groundwater recharge. 
15.  Impervious Surfaces. New development shall be designed to minimize the amount of impervious surfaces in order to maximize the amount of on-site infiltration. 
16.  Rain Gutters. Approved rain gutters shall be provided to receive all roof water and dispose of the water in a groundwater enhancing and non-eroding manner where the director of community development determines it to be necessary because of steepness of slope or presence of erodible materials. Direct connection of rain gutter outlets to impervious surfaces shall be minimized. 
17.  Building Site Drainage. All graded building pads shall slope a minimum of five percent for ten (10) feet to an approved drainage device, or as approved by the director of community development. The drainage device shall be an approved system which conducts the water to a street, recharge area or drainage way. The top of footing stems or finish floor, if a concrete slab, shall extend above the top of street curb or inlet to the drainage device by a minimum of six inches plus two percent of the distance from the footing to the drainage device or curb. The director of community development may allow two percent to be used, if, because of terrain or soils, five percent is not reasonably attainable or necessary. 
18.  Capacity of Drainage Devices. On graded sites, the director of community development may require that drainage devices calculated to convey runoff from a twenty-five-year frequency storm or greater be installed, if deemed necessary to prevent erosion, to conduct stormwater around buildings or structures and to the nearest recharge area, drainage way, or as approved by the director of community development. 
19.  Appearance of Drainage or Recharge Devices. Where drainage devices are highly visible from the street or located in the public viewshed, they shall be shielded from view, if practical. Where visible, drainage devices shall be compatible with the character of the area and the existing topography. Exposed concrete overside drains are prohibited within these situations unless a visual analysis indicates the prohibition to be unnecessary. If they are visible, the size shall be the minimum necessary to handle drainage and ensure ability to maintain all drainage devices which collect from the slopes, and shall convey drainage by means of underground pipes or rock-lined ditches or other approved materials to blend with the natural topography in character, color and design. Transitions from natural drainage courses to developed areas shall be accomplished with comparable landscaping and grading to blend with existing topography. Detention, retention, or recharge basins shall be designed as a visual and/or recreational amenity within a project whenever practical. 
20.  Groundwater Recharge. Groundwater recharge elements must be included in the project design to mitigate the impacts on recharge caused by the reduction in the permeability of soil areas on the site, except when any of the following site characteristics exist: 
a.  High groundwater in the area limits the effectiveness of recharge efforts or enhancing groundwater recharge would create additional problems related to high groundwater. 
b.  The entire site being developed is shown to contain impervious soils that would not benefit from recharge efforts. 
c.  There is a known geologic instability that would be negatively impacted by increased groundwater recharge. 
d.  It can be demonstrated that no additional runoff will occur from the development. 
e.  Federal or state regulations prohibit recharge. 
B.  Groundwater Recharge. All areas on the project site that will become impervious or will have their soil permeability impaired (such as compaction of soil under an all weather driveway) must be mitigated to the maximum extent practicable with recharge enhancement elsewhere on the parcel. Off-site mitigation is a secondary alternative. 
1.  Areas Subject to Flooding. Buildings or structures are not permitted in an area determined by the director of community development to be subject to flood hazard by inundation, overflow, high velocity flows or erosion, except where the buildings or structures comply with the standards in Section 16.44.050, and provisions are made to eliminate identified hazards to the satisfaction of the public works director. These provisions may include providing adequate drainage facilities, protective walls, suitable fill, raising the floor level of the building or structure, or other means. The building and other structures (including walls and fences) shall be placed on the site so that water or mud flow will not be a hazard to on- or off-site structures or adjacent property. In the application of this standard, the director of community development shall enforce as a minimum the current federal flood plain management regulations as defined in the National Flood Insurance Program authorized by United States Code Title 42, Section 4001-4128 and contained in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59 et seq., which are hereby adopted and incorporated into this title by reference as though they were fully set forth here. 
2.  Design of Floodproofing Measures. Floodproofing measures required by the director of community development shall be designed by a licensed architect or registered civil engineer. 
3.  Subdrains. The director of community development may require the installation of approved subdrains in areas where underground water is anticipated. 
4.  Runoff Computations. Runoff computations may be made by the "rational method" except where specific methods for calculating individual residential retention basins have been adopted or with the approval of the director of community development. 
5.  Alternate Designs. Alternate designs which provide equivalent safety and are approved by the public works director may be used in lieu of those contained in this section. 
6.  Hydromodification Control. If the director of community development has determined that the project could cause off-site erosion or adverse impacts to beneficial uses as a result of an increase in runoff rates and/or duration, the project shall incorporate hydromodification control measures in compliance with low impact development (LID) handbook requirements.

f.  Key and Bench Inspection. After keys and benches are excavated, but before fill is placed. 
g.  Rough Grade Inspection. When all rough grading has been completed, including terraces, swales, and other drainage devices. 
h.  Post-Construction Stormwater Inspection. When all work has been completed, all disturbed areas of the construction site have been stabilized, and all longterm (permanent) stormwater pollution prevention and erosion and sedimentation control measures have been installed. Consistent with the general construction permit (where applicable) and city requirements, in order for the post-construction stormwater inspection to be approved, all soil disturbing activities shall have been completed and one of the following shall have been met: 
i.  A uniform vegetative cover of seventy (70) percent coverage has been established. In arid areas where native vegetation covers less than one hundred (100) percent of the surface, the seventy-percent coverage criterion shall be proportionally adjusted (i.e. where native vegetation covers fifty (50) percent: 0.50 x 0.70 = 0.35 - 35 percent); or 
ii.  Equivalent stabilization measures have been employed (e.g. fiber blankets, channel liners, mulch, etc.). 
iii.  All temporary erosion and sediment control measures that are no longer needed have been removed. 
i.  Final Inspection. When all work, including installation of drainage structures, other protective devices, planting, slope stabilization and all erosion control measures has been completed in accordance with the final approved plan and the required reports have been submitted to the director of community development and accepted as complete. 
j.  Other Inspections. In addition to the inspections above, such other inspections of any work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this chapter and other laws and regulations as may be required by the director of community development including requirements of the NPDES permit of the city of Arroyo Grande for its stormwater discharges. A licensed landscape architect, qualified biologist, archeologist, agricultural advisor, or other qualified professional may be required to be present during inspections. 
k.  Rainy Season Inspection. During the rainy season (between October 15 and April 15), inspections shall be conducted to verify compliance with required BMPs based on potential for threat to water quality, as determined by the director of community development. Criteria to be considered include area of disturbance, earthwork quantities, and proximity to watercourses. Based on this assessment, a threat priority will be assigned and inspections shall occur as follows: 
Construction Site
Priority Low Medium High Frequency of inspection. Once or twice during the rainy season. Twice or more during the rainy season. Monthly, and prior to rain events with 50% chance or more of producing rain.  
    High priority construction sites are defined as all projects subject to the construction general permit and a subset of projects not subject to the construction general permit that meets one or more of the following circumstances: Discharges directly drain to a creek, involves site work on slopes of twenty (20) percent or greater, involves hillside development on slopes steeper than ten (10) percent, involves more than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of land disturbance, include excavation of one hundred (100) CY of materials or more, and/or that have grading located within a geologic study or flood hazard areas. 
    Low priority construction sites include all those that consist primarily of interior improvements only. Medium construction site priority are those that are neither defined as low or a high construction site priority.

5.  In determining the amount of civil penalty to impose, the court shall consider all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the extent of the harm caused by the conduct constituting the violation; the nature and persistence of such conduct; the length of time over which the conduct occurred; the assets, liabilities and net worth of the persons responsible, whether corporate or individual; any corrective action taken by the persons responsible; and the cooperation or lack of cooperation in efforts toward abatement or correction. 
D.  Additional Actions and Remedies. 
1.  Notice of Violation Recordation. Whenever the director of community development determines that work has not been completed in accordance with a permit or the plans and specifications relating thereto, or whenever the director of community development determines that work has been done without the required permit, the director of community development may record a notice of violation. The owner(s) of the property, as revealed by the assessment roll on which the violation is situated, and any other person responsible for the violation shall be notified of the recordation, if their address is available. If the responsible party fails to act in response to written notification of the director of community development, an erosion problem may be declared a public nuisance and may be abated according to procedures in the Municipal Code. Where there is an emergency condition of erosion or sediment damaging a waterway, marsh, other body of water, or private or public property, the director of community development may have the necessary corrective work done and then bill the responsible party or place a lien against the offending property. 
2.  Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or who violates any stop work order or notice may also be in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act and/or the State Porter-Cologne Act and may be subject to prosecution under those Acts, including civil and criminal penalties. 
3.  Any person who knowingly makes any false material statement, representation, or certification in any record or other document submitted or required to be maintained by this chapter or the general construction permit is subject to civil or criminal action. 
4.  Any person who violates any order issued by the city for violation of the provisions of this chapter regulating or prohibiting discharge of both stormwater and non-stormwater, and which causes, or threatens to cause, pollutants to enter the city's stormwater conveyance system shall be liable for such amounts that the city may be fined by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) or Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), or the amount of any civil liability imposed on the city for non-compliance with the SWRCB permits. 
E.  Additional Procedures for Unauthorized Grading. 
1.  Additional Procedures to Remedy Unauthorized Grading Without a Permit-Finding and Declaration. The city council finds and declares that unauthorized grading without a permit often results in soil erosion, drainage, visual and other destructive long-term impacts which are not satisfactorily alleviated or corrected by the usual enforcement procedures, such as criminal violations or judicial proceedings concerning public nuisances. Further, such grading often causes harm unique to the graded parcel and the properties surrounding it, and the long-term correction measures for each such unauthorized grading requires detailed consideration and formulation, usually after formal public hearings. 
a.  Upon discovery of unauthorized grading without a permit, the director of community development shall, where feasible, contact the owner of the property upon which the grading occurred, and the person who did the grading. If the building official and the owner and contractor can agree within thirty (30) days upon a remedial program which can be accomplished in no more than ninety (90) days, no further city action shall be required at that time. The director of community development shall obtain a cash bond from the owner or contractor, payable upon request, and a right-of-entry form signed by the owner to guarantee the city's right to do the remedial program as agreed if not done by the owner or contractor within the agreed time period. 
b.  If the director of community development cannot reach such a satisfactory agreement, he or she shall, within thirty (30) days, submit a detailed report and recommendations to the city manager and city council requesting the initiation of formal council proceedings under the city's nuisance abatement ordinance to abate the public nuisance created on the premises by the unauthorized grading. The object of such proceedings shall be the ordering of corrective measures, subject to the city's power to correct the problem and place a lien upon the real property for all costs of correction. For purposes of the nuisance abatement proceedings, the city council declares that unauthorized grading without a permit is a public nuisance, per se. 
F.  Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies identified in this chapter are in addition to and do not supersede or limit any other remedies, including administrative, civil and/or criminal remedies pursuant to federal, state, and local law. The remedies provided in this chapter shall be cumulative and not exclusive. 
(Ord. No. 660, § 2(Exh. A), 2-25-2014) 
13.24.170 - Hazards. 
A.  General. No person shall cause or allow the persistence of a condition on any site that could cause accelerated erosion. Accelerated erosion shall be controlled and/or prevented by the responsible person or the property owner by using practices outlined hereinafter as applicable. Additional measures may be necessary, and may be specifically required by the building official when work is on geological unstable areas, thirty (30) percent or steeper slopes, and/or on soils with a severe erosion hazard rating by a USDA Soil Survey. Soil sterilants that last longer than four weeks shall not be used on soils or slopes which may subsequently need vegetation for erosion and sediment control. Where feasible, erosion hazard problems shall be controlled no later than the beginning of the next winter or adverse season. 
B.  Hazardous Conditions. Whenever the director of community development determines that any existing excavation or embankment or cut or fill on private property has become a hazard to life and limb, or endangers property, or adversely affects the safety, use or stability of a public way, drainage channel or causes significant impact on the natural resources of the area, the owner of the property upon which the excavation, cut or fill is located, or other person or agent in control of the property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the director of community development shall, within the period specified therein, repair or eliminate such hazard and conform with the requirements of this chapter. 
C.  No permits of any kind shall be issued if the director of community development determines that proposed construction work is hazardous to the extent described above, or the work is subject to a major flood hazard dangerous to life or property, and which hazard cannot be eliminated, prevented, or corrected. 
(Ord. No. 660, § 2(Exh. A), 2-25-2014) 
13.24.180 - Fees. 
    Fees for grading permits and grading, drainage, and erosion and sedimentation control plan checking shall be as set forth in the fee ordinance adopted by the city council. In compliance with the adopted fee schedule, the director of community development may require payment of actual recorded costs, plus overhead, for those applications which will exceed city fees for processing, plan checking, administration, and/or inspection. 
(Ord. No. 660, § 2(Exh. A), 2-25-2014) 
13.24.190 - Bonds and securities. 
    The director of community development may require bonds in such form and amounts as may be deemed necessary to assure that the work, if not completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, will be corrected to eliminate hazardous conditions. In lieu of a surety bond the applicant may file a cash bond or instrument of credit with the director of community development in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond. The surety bond, or in lieu thereof, less the costs of remedial work, if any, shall be released when the director of community development determines that the best management practices for erosion and sediment control practices have permanently stabilized the site, but not later than eighteen (18) months after installation of all permanent erosion control practices.

Chapter 13.27 - CITY EASEMENTS 
Sections: 

13.27.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of the city council, in adopting this section of the Municipal Code, to permit property owners who have property on which the city has an easement, to place structures or otherwise utilize such property, in appropriate circumstances, while assuring that the city's easement is not impeded or interfered with. 
(Ord. No. 610, § 2, 5-26-2009) 
13.27.020 - Interference with city easements. 
    The existence of a city easement on property does not preclude a property owner from utilizing their property in any manner that is not inconsistent with the purpose or use of the easement. Structures constructed or placed in city easements may impede the city's ability to access and maintain public facilities, such as underground utilities, including sewer, water and drainage facilities. In order to ensure necessary access to and full use of any city easement, it shall be unlawful to construct or place any structure in a city easement that interferes with the use, maintenance or repair of the easement or public facilities located within the easement, except as otherwise provided in this section. A property owner that constructs or places or allows the construction or placement of a structure in a city easement which interferes with the use, maintenance or repair of the easement or public facilities located within the easement shall be responsible and liable for payment of any and all costs that are associated with the removal of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 610, § 2, 5-26-2009) 
13.27.030 - Agreement. 
    If a building permit is required for construction or placement of a structure, the city, in its sole discretion, may refuse to issue a building permit should the city, in its sole discretion, determine that the proposed construction will interfere with the purpose or use of the easement. However, should the city, in its sole discretion, issue a building permit for the construction or placement of any structure within the easement, a condition precedent to such permit issuance shall be the execution of a written agreement by the property owner obligating the owner to promptly remove the structure when so requested by the city and to pay any and all costs that are associated with the structure's removal and comply with any other terms and conditions determined to be necessary and appropriate by the city. Such agreements may be executed by the city manager, provided they are in a form acceptable to the city attorney.

When a person signs a written promise to appear at the time and place specified therein, and has not posted bail as provided in the Penal Code of the state, the magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a warrant for his or her arrest within twenty (20) days after such person has failed to appear as promised, or if such person promises to appear before an officer authorized to accept bail, other than a magistrate, and fails to do so on or before the date that he or she promised to appear, then within twenty (20) days after delivery of such written promise to appear by the officer to the magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense, such magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a warrant for his or her arrest. When such person violates his or her promise to appear before an officer authorized to receive bail other than a magistrate, the officer shall immediately deliver to the magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense charged the written promise to appear and the complaint, if any, filed by the arresting officer or employee. 
I.  Attorney's Fees. In any civil action commenced by the city to abate a public nuisance, to enjoin a violation of any provision of this development code, or to collect a civil debt owing to the city, the city shall be entitled to recover from the defendant in any such action reasonable attorney's fees and cost of suit.

(Prior code § 9-02.160) 
16.12.170 - Right to farm provisions. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose of this section to: 
1.  Protect agricultural land uses and designations identified on the general plan and zoning map from conflicts with nonagricultural land uses that may result in financial hardship to agricultural operators or the termination of their operation; 
2.  Promote a good neighbor policy between agriculturalists and residents by advising purchasers and residents of property adjacent to or near agricultural operations of the inherent potential problems associated with such purchase or residence including, but not limited to, the sounds, odors, dust and chemicals that may accompany agricultural operations so that such purchasers and residents will understand the inconveniences that accompany living side by side to agriculture and be prepared to accept such problems as the natural result of living in or near agricultural areas. 
    It is the intent of the city council that no agricultural activity, operation or facility, or appurtenances thereof, conducted or maintained for commercial purposes, and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality, shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or about the locality on nonagricultural land after the same has been in operation for more than three years if it was not a nuisance at the time it began. 
B.  Applicability. "Agricultural land" means land use categories identified in the land use element, land zoned exclusively for agricultural use (as defined in Section 16.04.070), or, for the purposes of subsections C. D. and E, land in agricultural production. 
C.  Policy. The city council finds that it is in the public's interest to preserve and protect agricultural land and operations within the city and to specifically protect these lands for exclusive agricultural use. The city council also finds that residential development adjacent to agricultural land and operations often leads to restrictions on farm operations to the detriment of the adjacent agricultural uses and economic viability of the city's agricultural industry as a whole. The purposes of this section, therefore, are to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the city; to preserve and protect for exclusive agricultural use those lands zoned for agricultural use; to support and encourage continued agricultural operations in the city; and to provide publicinformation regarding this section which outlines the inherent potential problems associated with living, purchasing and/or residing adjacent to agricultural lands. These potential problems include, but are not limited to the sounds, odors, dust and chemicals that may accompany agricultural operations. 
D.  Public Information. Information concerning this section shall be made available by the city planning department, including the following notice: 
The City of Arroyo Grande is an agricultural City with many areas zoned for and/or utilized for agricultural operations. The presence of farms yields significant aesthetic and economic benefits to the residents of the City. Thus, the City's agriculture must be protected, including areas where it is near residential development, and the City of Arroyo Grande has enacted an ordinance which provides that properly conducted agricultural operations will not be deemed a nuisance. 
    Accordingly, if the property you own, rent, or lease is located close to agricultural lands or operations, you may be subject to inconvenience or discomfort from the following agricultural operations: 
Cultivation and tilling of the soil; burning of agricultural waste products; lawful and proper use of agricultural chemicals including, but not limited to, the application of pesticides and fertilizers; and production, irrigation, pruning, growing, harvesting and processing of any agricultural commodity, including horticulture, timber, apiculture, the raising of livestock, fish, poultry and commercial practices performed as incident to or in conjunction with such agricultural operation, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or market, or to carriers or transportation to market. These operations may generate dust, smoke, noise and odor. 
    The city is required to make information on section and its provisions available to the public upon request. 
E.  Agricultural Buffer. 
1.  In conjunction with general plan policies outlined in the agriculture, conservation and open space element, and specifically Objective Ag5, the city has determined that the use of property for agricultural operations is a high priority. To minimize potential conflicts between agricultural and nonagricultural land uses, including the protection of public health, the reduction of noise and odor, and the reduction of risk to farm operations from domestic animal predation, crop theft and damage and complaints from neighboring urban dwellers, all new development adjacent to any designated agricultural district shall be required to provide an agricultural buffer. "Development" as used in this section, means subdivision of land, use permits and building permits for new residential units. 
2.  The buffer area shall be a minimum of one hundred (100) feet, measured from the edge of the designated agricultural district. Optimally, to achieve a maximum separation, a buffer wider than one hundred (100) feet is encouraged and may be required if it is determined through environmental review under CEQA and/or recommended by the San Luis Obispo County Agricultural Commissioner. A decreased buffer distance may be allowed if it can be demonstrated that a physical buffer exists (e.g. Arroyo Grande Creek) that is adequate and approved by the San Luis Obispo County Agricultural Commissioner. 
3.  The minimum one hundred (100) foot agricultural buffer area shall be comprised of two components: a twenty (20) foot wide agricultural landscaped transition area contiguous to an eighty (80) foot wide agricultural buffer adjacent to the designated agricultural district. The twenty (20) foot transition area may include pedestrian access. The combined one hundred (100) foot agricultural buffer shall not qualify as farmland mitigation as required by Section 16.12.170.F. 
4.  The following shall be permitted in the one hundred (100) foot agricultural buffer: native plants, tree or hedge rows, roads, drainage channels, storm retention ponds, natural areas such as creeks or drainage swales, utility corridors, storage, and any use, including agricultural or limited commercial uses, determined by the planning commission to be consistent with the use of the property as an agricultural buffer. No new residential use shall be permitted within the buffer area unless it is determined there would be no other economically viable use of the property. Restoration of a damaged residence within the buffer area may be pursued in accordance with Section 16.48.110. 
5.  The one hundred (100) foot agricultural buffer shall be established by the developer pursuant to a plan approved by the community development director and the parks, recreation and facilities director. The plan shall include provisions for the use of integrated weed and pest management techniques and soil erosion control. An agreement in the form approved by the city attorney shall be recorded, which shall include the requirements of this section. 
F.  Agricultural Land Conversion. 
1.  The city shall require agricultural mitigation by applicants for discretionary entitlements which will subdivide or change the use of land zoned agriculture or agriculture preserve to any non-agricultural use. 
2.  Agricultural mitigation shall be satisfied by: 
a.  Granting an agricultural conservation easement, a farmland deed restriction or other agricultural conservation mechanism to or for the benefit of the city and/or a qualifying entity approved by the city. Mitigation shall be required for that portion of the land which no longer will be designated or zoned agricultural land, including any portion of the land used for park and recreation purposes, that will 1) permanently protect prime agricultural and prime soils from development; 2) or will benefit preservation of agricultural land and operations through other means as determined by the city council. At least as many acres of prime agricultural land shall be protected as was changed to a non-agricultural use within city limits, or up to two times as many acres of agricultural land shall be protected outside the city but within the city's area of environmental concern, as was changed to a nonagricultural use, in order to mitigate the loss of agricultural land; or 
b.  In lieu of conserving agricultural land as provided above if the city council determines that the payment of in-lieu fees provide a superior opportunity to satisfy the goals and policies of the general plan, agricultural mitigation may be satisfied by the payment of a fee, established by the city council by resolution or through an enforceable agreement with the developer, based upon a farmland replacement factor of up to two-to-one (2:1) to be used for acquisition of a farmland conservation easement or farmland deed restriction. The in-lieu fee option must be approved by the city council. The fee shall be based upon current appraisal information for the acquisition of a conservation easement on replacement land plus all related city administrative and legal costs. The in-lieu fee, paid to the city, shall be used for farmland mitigation purposes, with priority given to lands with prime agricultural soils located within the city; or 
c.  Other mitigation measures may be determined acceptable by the city council. 
3.  It is the intent of this program to work in a coordinated fashion with San Luis Obispo County and state agencies, and, therefore, farmland conservation easement areas may overlap partially or completely with habitat easement areas approved by the state department of fish and game. Up to twenty percent (20%) of the farmland conservation easement area may be enhanced for wildlife habitat purposes as per the requirements of the state department of fish and game and/or San Luis Obispo County management programs; payment of appropriate maintenance, processing or other fees may also be required. 
4.  Comparable Soils and Water Supply. 
a.  To the greatest extent possible, the agricultural mitigation land shall be comparable in soil quality with the agricultural land whose use is being changed to nonagricultural use. 
b.  The agricultural mitigation land shall have an adequate water supply to support agricultural use and the water supply on the agricultural mitigation land shall be protected in the agricultural conservation easement, the farmland deed restriction or other document evidencing the agricultural mitigation. 
5.  Eligible Lands. The first priority for agricultural mitigation land shall be farmland located within city limits. The second priority for agricultural mitigation shall be farmland located adjacent to city limits, and the third priority, farmland located within the city's area of environmental concern, as shown in the 2001 General Plan. The criteria for preferred locations or zones for agricultural mitigation land shall be determined by the city council after receiving input from the planning commission and San Luis Obispo County Agricultural Commissioner. In making their determination, the following factors shall be considered: 
a.  The preferred locations shall be compatible with the 2001 General Plan and the general plan of San Luis Obispo County. 
b.  The preferred locations shall include comparable soil types to that most likely to be lost due to proposed development. 
c.  Agricultural mitigation land consisting of contiguous parcels shall be preferred. 
d.  Land previously protected by a conservation easement of any nature or kind is not eligible to qualify as agricultural mitigation land. 
6.  Requirements of Instruments-Duration. 
a.  To qualify as an instrument encumbering agricultural mitigation land, all owners of the agricultural mitigation land shall execute the instrument. 
b.  The instrument shall be in recordable form and contain an accurate legal description setting forth the description of the agricultural mitigation land. 
c.  The instrument shall prohibit any activity, which substantially impairs or diminishes the agricultural productivity of the land, as determined by the planning commission. 
d.  The instrument shall protect the existing water rights and retain them with the agricultural mitigation land. 
e.  The applicant shall pay an agricultural mitigation fee to pay the costs of administering, monitoring and enforcing the instrument in an amount determined by city council. 
f.  Interests in agricultural mitigation land shall be held in trust by a qualifying entity and/or the city, in perpetuity. Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, the qualifying entity or the city shall not sell, lease, or convey any interest in agricultural mitigation land which it shall acquire, except to continue agricultural uses in accordance with the encumbering instrument. 
g.  If judicial proceedings find that the public interests described in Chapter 16.28 of this title can no longer reasonably be fulfilled as to an interest acquired, the interest in the agricultural mitigation land may be extinguished through sale and the proceeds shall be used to acquire interests in other agricultural mitigation land in San Luis Obispo County, as approved by the city and provided in this chapter. 
h.  If any qualifying entity owning an interest in agricultural mitigation land ceases to exist, the duty to hold, administer, monitor and enforce the interest shall pass to the city or its designee. 
i.  Each qualifying entity shall monitor lands and easements it acquires under this chapter and shall review and monitor the implementation of the management and maintenance plans for these lands and easement areas. 
7.  Violation. 
    Any person or entity who violates any provision of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding the maximum prescribed by law. In addition, any person or entity who violates any provision of this chapter shall be liable to the transferee of the property for actual damages.

(Ord. No. 623, § 2(Exh. A), 5-25-2010) 
16.12.180 - Right to keep animals provisions. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. 
1.  As development occurs within the city, new residential, commercial and other construction will locate adjacent to residential uses where the pre-established right to keep animals, in accordance with the provisions of this title may become the subject of nuisance complaints and/or litigation. 
2.  To conserve and protect the continued right to keep animals in accord with the provisions of this title, this section is provided to limit the circumstances under which such legal right may be deemed to constitute a nuisance. The intent is to balance those rights with the rights of non-animal residential uses who own, occupy or use land adjacent to such existing animal oriented residential uses. 
B.  Applicability. The right to keep animals as herein provided shall apply to the keeping of animals within residential districts and all other legal right to keep animals existing at the time of adoption of this title. 
C.  Policy. 
1.  The noncommercial keeping of animals, whether established in accord with this title or legally pre-established prior to its adoption, shall not be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or about the locality of existing residential uses legally vested within that right. 
2.  This section shall not invalidate any provision contained in the Health and Safety Code, or any other applicable city or county ordinance provisions, whether adopted prior or subsequent to the adoption of this title, if the keeping of animals as discussed herein constitutes a nuisance, public or private, as specifically defined or described in any such provision. 
3.  This section is not to be construed so as to modify or abridge the state law set out in the California Civil Code relative to nuisances, but rather it is only to be utilized in the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of city ordinances and regulations.

(Prior code § 9-03.020) 
16.16.030 - Specific plan adoption and amendments. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. Specific plans are a significant tool to implement the general plan, as well as an inducement to the development of mixed use developments desired by the city. A specific plan documents the proposed distribution, location, extent and intensity of major components of public and private transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy, parks, and other essential facilities proposed to be located within or needed to support the land uses described in the plan, as well as implementation and financing methods and added benefits to the city as a whole. It is the purpose of this section to provide a method for the adoption of specific plans, in order to provide adequate development flexibility for innovation in residential building types, land use mixes, site design, and development concepts. In addition, it is the purpose of this section to provide a method for amending specific plans to ensure their continued effectiveness and responsiveness to market demands over time. 
    Additional information regarding the specific plan zoning district can be found in Chapter 16.44. 
B.  Authority. The city council is authorized to approve specific plans and specific plan amendments. The planning director, staff advisory committee, and planning commission shall provide recommendations to the city council regarding specific plan adoption and amendments. A public hearing pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.12.160 of this title shall be required. 
C.  Initiation of Specific Plans and Amendments to Specific Plans. Adoption of a new specific plan or an amendment to an existing specific plan may be initiated by any of the following actions: 
1.  The consensus of the city council or planning commission; 
2.  An application from a property owner or his or her authorized agent or any affected party. If the property for which a specific plan or specific plan amendment is proposed is in more than one ownership, all the owners or their authorized agents may join in filing the application. 
    This section shall apply to all sites designated in the general plan for a specific plan or any other area of the city where the applicant believes that implementation of a specific plan will benefit the project and the city. In addition, the city council or planning commission may determine that because of a project's size, mixed uses, adverse environmental impacts, local controversy, or other factors, a specific plan is required for a privately-initiated project. 
D.  Submittal and Review Requirements. 
1.  Pre-application Procedure. 
a.  Prior to submitting an application for a specific plan, the applicant or prospective developer shall apply for a preapplication review conference with the planning director and staff advisory committee to obtain information and guidance before entering into binding commitments incurring substantial expense in the preparations of plans, surveys, and other data.

Such analysis may be requested as a part of the preapplication review procedure, may be made a requirement for submission of an application for a specific plan, or may be requested as part of the environmental assessment or EIR. 
c.  Following initial preliminary consultations pursuant to this section, the planning director may require submission of a competently prepared commercial market analysis, if applicable, for any proposed shopping center or major commercial uses, showing the need for such uses, in the location requested, and inadequacy of existing district sites to meet this need. The market analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
i.  Determination of potential trade area; 
ii.  Estimates of existing and future population of the trade area; 
iii.  Determination of existing and potential effective buying power in the trade area; and 
iv.  Determination of the net potential customer buying power for the proposed commercial development. Such analysis may be requested as a part of the preapplication review procedure or may be made a requirement for submission of an application for a specific plan or may be requested as part of the environmental assessment or EIR.

(Prior code § 9-03.040) 
16.16.050 - Conditional use permits. 
A.  Purpose. A conditional use permit is intended to allow the establishment of those uses that have some special impact or uniqueness such that their effects on the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed for a particular location. The permit application process allows for the review of the location and design of the proposed use, configuration of improvements, and potential impact on the surrounding area from the proposed use. The review shall determine whether the proposed use should be permitted, by weighing the public need for and benefit to be derived from the use against any adverse impact it may cause. 
B.  Authority. Except for concurrent applications as provided for in Section 16.12.070, the planning commission is authorized to approve conditional use permits, subject to the appeal provisions of Section 16.12.150. Conditional use permit applications involving new construction or any changes to the exterior of an existing building shall be subject to the architectural review procedures outlined in Section 16.12.190. 
    If the community development director determines that all the following circumstances exist regarding a development proposal, a conditional use permit may not be required; and the project shall be subject to minor use permit review (see Section 16.12.060) or business license clearance (see Section 16.12.180): 
1.  The project will be occupying an existing building or will require an addition to an existing structure that will not result in an increase of more than twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area of the structure before the addition, or five hundred (500) square feet, whichever is less; and 
2.  The proposed use is the same or similar in character to the existing use, as determined by the community development. Exceptions may be allowed if the community development director determines that the new use is less intensive than the existing use; and 
3.  The project is exempt from CEQA review and there is no possibility of a significant impact on the environment. 
    The community development director, staff advisory committee, and architectural review committee shall provide recommendations to the planning commission regarding conditional use permits. A public hearing pursuant to Section 16.12.160 of this title shall be required. 
C.  Submittal and Review Requirements. 
1.  Applications for Conditional Use Permits shall contain the following: 
a.  Completed planning application form and required fee and attachments (see also Section 16.12.030); 
b.  The following drawings, graphics or illustrations signed by the architect, draftsperson, designer, engineer or person designing the plans in accordance with all applicable state and city laws.

A public hearing shall not be required for granting of a minor exception. 
    The community development director is limited to granting minor exceptions for the following: 
1.  Fence Height. In any district, a maximum height of any fence, wall, or equivalent screening may be increased by a maximum of two feet where the topography of sloping sites or a difference in grade between adjoining sites warrants an increase in height to maintain a level of privacy, or to maintain the effectiveness of screening, as would generally be provided by such fence, wall, or screening in similar circumstances. 
2.  Setbacks. In any residential district, the community development director may decrease minimum setbacks by not more than ten (10) percent where such decreases are necessary for significantly improved site planning or architectural design, creation or maintenance of views, or would otherwise facilitate highly desirable features or amenities, and where such increase will not unreasonably affect contiguous sites. 
3.  Lot Coverage. In any district the community development director may increase the maximum allowable lot coverage by not more than ten (10) percent of the lot area where such increases are necessary for significantly improved site planning or architectural design, creation or maintenance of views, or would otherwise facilitate highly desirable features or amenities, and where such increase will not unreasonably affect contiguous sites. 
4.  Height. In any district the community development director may authorize a ten (10) percent increase in the maximum allowable building height. Such increases may be approved only where necessary to significantly improve the site plan or architectural design and where scenic views or solar access on surrounding properties are not affected. 
5.  Parking. In any district the community development director may waive strict adherence to the parking standards contained in Chapter 16.56 when a change or expansion in use is proposed in an existing building or an addition or enlargement of an existing single-family residence is proposed and it is not feasible to provide sufficient on-site parking on the parcel. A minor exception may also be granted for parking space size of up to two feet. 
6.  Deviations from standards described in Design Guidelines and Standards for Historic Districts pertaining to Design Overlay District 2.4. 
7.  Minor Items. A minor exception may be considered for other minor development regulations. If the minor development regulation is not listed above, the planning commission may make an interpretation. The planning commission must make the findings that such a request is compatible with adjoining uses, is consistent with the goals and objectives of the general plan and intent of the development code, and that the item is minor in scale. 
C.  Submittal and Review Requirements. 
1.  An application for a minor use permit for a minor exception shall contain: 
a.  Completed planning application form and required fee and attachments (see also Section 16.12.030);

3.  Notice of the decision shall be mailed to the applicant and to property owners of parcels within three hundred (300) feet of the property for which a minor exception has been requested and reported in accordance with Section 16.12.155. The notice shall indicate the appeal provisions of Section 16.12.150. Copies of the decision shall also be provided to the planning commission, public works and building and fire departments. 
D.  Findings. The community development director shall make all the following findings prior to approving an application for a minor exception: 
1.  That the strict or literal interpretation and endorsement of the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship; 
2.  That there are exceptional circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same district; 
3.  That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the same district; 
4.  That the granting of the minor use permit for a minor exception will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties classified in the same district and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity; 
5.  That the granting of a minor use permit for a minor exception is consistent with the objectives and policies of the general plan and the intent of this title.

16.16.130 - Minor use permits-Architectural review. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The minor use permit process for architectural review is intended to implement general plan design policies and other adopted policy and design guidelines and documents that stipulate standards, regulation, and guidelines governing design. The city is a city with unique characteristics, ideal climate conditions, spectacular natural vistas, and dynamic natural features. Further, the appearance of buildings, structures, signs, and the land has a material and substantial relationship to property values and the taxable value of property in the city. In order to protect the economic welfare of the community, it is the policy of the city council to maintain and enhance the social and economic values created by past and present investments in the community, by requiring all future development to respect these traditions, and by requiring that all buildings and structures placed on the land respect the natural land forms and become compatible part of the total community environment, both in the local neighborhood and the city as a whole. The purposes of architectural review are to ensure the following: 
1.  That the location and configuration of structures developed within the city are visually harmonious with their sites and with natural landforms and surrounding site, structures and streetscapes; 
2.  That the proposed design produces harmonious transitions in both the scale and character of development between adjacent land uses; 
3.  That site access and circulation thereon is safe and convenient for pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles; 
4.  That sensitive areas, structures and sites as defined in this section, are designed with respect to notable features of the project site; 
5.  That building, site and architectural design is accomplished in an energy efficient manner shall be respected in all site, building and architectural design; 
6.  That the materials, textures, colors and details of proposed construction are an appropriate expression of the design concept and function, and are, to the extent feasible, compatible with the adjacent and neighboring structures and functions; 
7.  That development proposals do not unnecessarily block scenic views from other buildings or from public ways, or visually dominate their surroundings with respect to mass and scale, to an extent inappropriate to their use; 
8.  That the amount and arrangement of open space and landscaping conforms to the requirements of this title, provides visually pleasing settings, and is appropriate to the design and function of the structure, site, and surrounding area; 
9.  That the design and location of signs and their materials and colors are consistent with the scale and character of the buildings to which they are attached or are located on the same site, and to ensure visual harmony between signs and surrounding developments; 
10.  That excessive and unsightly grading of hillsides does not occur, and to ensure the preservation of the character of natural landforms and existing vegetation where feasible; 
11.  That excellence in architectural design is maintained in order to enhance the visual environment of the city and to protect the economic value of existing structures; 
12.  That historically significant structures and sites are developed in a manner consistent with their historic values; 
13.  That the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare are protected; 
14.  That development plans comply with applicable policies, standards, ordinances, and design guidelines. 
B.  Authority. The architectural review committee is authorized to make recommendations to the community development director, planning commission or city council. Minor use permits applications for architectural review shall be approved by the decision-making body acting on the permit or approval requiring architectural review pursuant to this title. The community development director may approve minor architectural review for projects that are subject to his or her approval authority without requesting the architectural review committee to provide a recommendation.

Designation of a historic resource or a historic district may be initiated by: (a) the owner of record of the property or resource, (b) the community development director, (c) the planning commission, (d) the city council, (e) by any resident of the city of Arroyo Grande, or (f) any organization with a recognized interest in historical preservation. Applications for designation must be accompanied by such historical and architectural information as is required by the community development director to make an informed recommendation concerning the application, together with the fee set by the city council. 
2.  Notice. The community development director shall publish and transmit a notice informing property owners of historic resources proposed to be designated and all interested parties of the time and location of all meetings in which the designations will be discussed and considered. 
3.  Community Development Director Decision. Except for concurrent applications as provided for in Section 16.12.070, the community development director is authorized to approve minor use permits for historic resource and historic district designations, subject to the appeal provisions of Section 16.12.150. The community development director shall prepare a written decision that shall contain the findings of fact upon which such decision is based. Copies of the decision shall be provided to the applicant and owners of the designated property or properties within the proposed historic district. 
4.  Public Hearing. A public hearing by the planning commission, pursuant to Section 16.12.160 of this title, shall be scheduled in the event that the property owner does not consent to the application for a proposed designation. 
5.  Findings. The community development director or the planning commission if the property owner does not consent, may designate the listing of a property as a historic resource only if all of the following findings of fact can be made in an affirmative manner: 
a.  The proposed project is consistent with the goals, objectives, policies and programs of the Arroyo Grande general plan; 
b.  Based upon consideration of information submitted in the record during the historic resource designation process the property meets any of the criteria listed in subsection B of this section; 
c.  The resource retains the integrity of the design, has not been inappropriately: (i) altered; (ii) relocated; (iii) added to; or (iv) remodeled. 
6.  Suspension of Work. While the community development director, planning commission or city council, on appeal, is considering a historic designation, all development and building work on the site proposed for historic designation shall be suspended. 
E.  Development and Building Permits. 
1.  No exterior alterations shall be made by any person to a historic resource, without a minor use permit and building permit, nor shall the building official or planning commission grant any permit to carry out such work on a historic resource, located in a historic district without the prior issuance of a minor use permit-plot plan review pursuant to Section 16.16.080 of this chapter. Decisions by the city pursuant to this section are "discretionary" and relate to "discretionary projects" as these terms are used in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Any permit, including a building permit, or other city approval that would authorize any change in the exterior of any proposed or designated historical resource, or the exterior of any structure, building or significant feature within a designated or proposed historic district, is a discretionary permit or approval within the meaning of CEQA. 
2.  Ordinary Maintenance and Repair. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any exterior feature of any structure or property covered by this section, so long as such maintenance and repair does not involve a change in exterior design, material or appearance. 
3.  Unsafe or Dangerous Conditions. None of the provisions of this section shall prevent any measures of construction, alteration or demolition necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous conditions of any structure, other feature or part thereof, where such condition has been declared unsafe or dangerous by the building official or the fire chief, and where the proposed measures have been declared necessary by such official, to correct the condition; provided, however, that only such work as is absolutely necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous condition and as is done with due regard for preservation of the appearance of the structure involved may be performed pursuant to this section. In the event any structure or other feature shall be damaged by fire, or other calamity, or by act of God, to such an extent that in the opinion of the aforesaid officials it cannot be reasonably repaired and restored, it may be removed in conformity with normal permit procedures and applicable laws. If the condition of an unsafe or dangerous historic resource, so permits, the official in charge of overseeing correction of such a condition shall consult with the ARC and community development director before carrying out corrective measures. 
4.  Duty to Keep in Good Repair. The owner, lessees and any other person in actual charge or possession of a historical resource shall take all steps necessary to prevent: 
a.  The substantial deterioration or decay of any exterior portion of such a resource; 
b.  The substantial deterioration or decay of any interior portions thereof the maintenance of which is necessary to preserve any exterior portion. 
As used in this section, the term "substantial deterioration or decay" shall refer to those conditions of the structure or improvement which threaten the structural or historical integrity of the resource or improvement. 
5.  Showing of Extreme Hardship. If the applicant presents evidence clearly demonstrating to the satisfaction of the community development director that failure to approve the application for a minor use permit or building permit will cause an immediate extreme hardship because of conditions peculiar to the particular structure or other feature involved, the planning commission may approve or conditionally approve such application even though it does not meet the standards set forth in subsection (E)(1) of this section. In determining whether extreme hardship exists, the community development director shall consider evidence which demonstrates: 
a.  Denial of the application will diminish the value of the subject property so as to leave substantially no value; 
b.  Sale or rental of the property is impractical, when compared to the cost of holding such property for uses permitted in the zoning district; 
c.  Utilization of the property for lawful purposes is prohibited or impractical; 
d.  Rental at a reasonable rate of return is not feasible. 
F.  Additional Findings for the Alteration or Demolition of a Designated Historic Resource. In evaluating applications for the alteration of a designated historical resource, with a recommendation by the ARC, or the community development director, planning commission or city council, upon appeal, shall consider the architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, materials, color and other factors and shall utilize the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring and Reconstructing Historic Buildings. Proposed alterations found consistent with the Secretary of Interior's Guidelines shall be considered less than significant under the CEQA review process. The community development director, planning commission or city council, upon appeal, shall approve the issuance of a minor use permit for any proposed alteration work if and only if it finds: 
1.  With regard to a historical resource the proposed work will neither adversely affect the exterior architectural features of the resource nor adversely affect the character or historical, architectural or aesthetic interest or value of such resource and its site based upon consistency with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring and Reconstructing Historic Buildings. 
2.  With regard to any property located within a historic district, the proposed work conforms to the standards for the district, and does not adversely affect the character of the district. 
3.  The work is consistent with the provisions in subsection E of this section. 
4.  Demolitions. When application is made for a minor use permit or demolition permit to demolish a historical resource the ARC, community development director or planning commission disapproval of the application shall mean that no development minor use permit or demolition permit shall be issued or demolition allowed until review and approval by the city is complete. 
G.  Historic Resource Protection Tax Incentives. In addition to any other incentive of federal or state law, property owners of duly designated historic resources may apply for Mills Act Historical Property Contracts ("Mills Act Contracts") with the city. A Mills Act historic resource protection tax incentive program may be established by city council resolution. This subsection will implement state law (Government Code Sections 50280 et seq.), allowing the approval of Mills Act Contracts by the city with owners of qualified historic properties within the city.

16.16.140 - Surface mining permit. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose and intent of this section to create and maintain an effective surface mining and reclamation policy as authorized by the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code, Section 2710 et seq.). While the preservation and extraction of economic viable mineral resources has been determined to be in the interests of the people of California by State Legislature, it is also recognized that surface mining activities may result in significant adverse environmental impacts. It is, therefore, the intent of this section to regulate surface mining operations so as to assure that: 
1.  The adverse effects of surface mining operations will be prevented or minimized, and that mined lands will be reclaimed to a usable condition that is readily adaptable for alternative land use; 
2.  The reclamation of mined land will be carried out in such a way that the continued mining of valuable minerals will not be precluded; and 
3.  The production and conservation of minerals will be encouraged, while giving consideration to values related to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, and aesthetic enjoyment; and that potential residual hazards to the public health and safety will be eliminated. 
B.  Authority. The planning commission is authorized to approve surface mining permits and reclamation plans, subject to the appeal provisions of Section 16.12.150. A public hearing pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.12.160 of this title shall be required. 
C.  Applicability. 
1.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to: 
a.  Excavations or grading conducted for farming or on-site construction, or for the purpose of restoring land following a flood or natural disaster; 
b.  Prospecting for, or the extraction of, minerals for commercial purposes and the removal of overburden in total amounts of less than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards in any one location. This exemption shall not apply to any single excavation that is greater than one acre in size; 
c.  Surface mining operations that are required by federal law, in order to protect a mining claim, if such operations are conducted solely for that purpose; 
d.  Such other surface mining operations that the State Mining and Geology Board finds are exempt from the provisions of the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 because they are of an infrequent nature and involve only minor surface disturbances. 
2.  Unless exempted by the provisions of this section, no person, firm, corporation or private association shall conduct surface mining operations in the incorporated area of the city without first obtaining a surface mining permit. 
D.  Submittal and Review Requirements. 
1.  Applications for surface mining permits shall contain the following: 
a.  Completed planning application form and required fee and attachments (see also Section 16.12.030); 
b.  A mining plan containing information regarding: 
i.  Progression of all operations of the facility, including time frames for each phase and the estimated life of the operation, 
ii.  Location of equipment, stockpiles, settling ponds, interim drainage, machinery and waste dumps, and areas to be mined, 
iii.  Progression of stripping and excavating through the use of cross sections, elevations and topographic maps, 
iv.  Time lags between mining and reclamation and equipment siting and removal and/or relocation, 
v.  Proposed methods of handling simultaneous excavation and reclamation, if applicable, 
vi.  Locations of all streams, roads, sewage disposal systems, water wells and utility facilities within five hundred (500) feet of the site, and the location of all proposed access roads to be constructed in conducting the surface mining operation, and 
vii.  Type of and amount of mineral commodities to be removed, the amount of waste materials to be retained on the site, and the amount of waste materials to be disposed of off-site, including the method and location of disposal of the waste materials; 
c.  A reclamation plan that shall: 
i.  Indicate the methods to be used to reclaim the land following mining operations, including a detailed schedule of the phasing and timing of each stage of reclamation, 
ii.  Describe the physical condition of the site upon the completion of all reclamation, including the proposed uses or potential uses of the reclaimed site, 
iii.  Contain a map that will delineate, through the use of cross sections and elevations, the physical characteristics of the land upon the conclusion of reclamation. A topographic map shall also be provided clearly indicating the location of the reclaimed land, 
iv.  Describe the manner in which abandoned or inoperable machinery, waste materials and scraps will be removed from the reclaimed site, and how contaminants will be controlled, 
v.  Describe the methods to be used to ensure that the site will contain stable waste piles and slopes, 
vi.  Describe how reclamation of this site may affect the future use of this area for mining purposes, 
vii.  Show that the proposed site in its final form will be, to the extent reasonable and practical, revegetated for soil stabilization, free of drainage and erosion problems, coordinated with present and anticipated future land use, and compatible with the topography and general environment of surrounding property. 
2.  Upon receipt of a completed application, the planning director shall notify the State Geologist of the filing of request for a surface mining permit. In addition, the planning director shall include the State Geologist in the public hearing notification list. 
3.  Review of a surface mining permit application shall be conducted pursuant to Section 16.16.050, conditional use permits. 
4.  Following a review of the application and public hearing pursuant to Section 16.12.160 of this title, the planning commission shall adopt a resolution indicating their decision and containing any conditions of approval and the findings of fact upon which such decision is based. 
E.  Required Findings. The planning commission may approve a surface mining permit application in whole or in part, with or without conditions, only if all the following findings of fact can be made in an affirmative manner: 
1.  The proposed use would not impair the integrity and character of the district in which it is to be established or located. 
2.  The proposed site is suitable for the type and intensity of the proposed mining operation. 
3.  There are adequate provisions for water, sanitation, and public utilities and services to ensure public health and safety. 
4.  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties and improvements in the vicinity. 
5.  The proposed use is consistent with the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code, Section 2710 et. seq.). 
6.  The mined lands will be reclaimed to a usable condition that is readily adaptable for an alternative land use appropriate to the district within which the site is located. 
F.  Periodic Review. As a condition of approval for a mining and reclamation plan, an annual review shall be conducted by the chief building official and city engineer to evaluate and ensure compliance with the plan.

16.16.150 - Development agreements. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The California Government Code permits local agencies and property owners to enter in contractual agreements as to the intensity, timing and conditions of development of real properties. Such development agreements provide an enhanced degree of certainty in the development process for both the property owner/developer and the public agency. The public interest will be adequately protected by noticed public hearings before the planning commission and city council and by a specific state law provision subjecting any development agreement to the people's right of referendum. 
    The purpose of this section is to specify the rules and procedures under which development agreement requests are to be reviewed and acted upon. Nothing herein shall be construed or applied at any time to require the city to enter into any such agreement; more specifically, but without limitation, no amount of preliminary negotiations, preliminary work, or any expenditure of funds shall be a basis for a claim of estoppel or bad faith that would require city approval or implementation of any unexecuted agreement. 
B.  Authority. The city council is authorized to approve development agreements. The planning director, staff advisory committee, and planning commission shall provide recommendations to the city council regarding development agreements. A public hearing pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.12.160 of this title shall be required. 
C.  Submittal and Review Requirements. 
1.  An application for a development agreement shall contain the following: 
a.  Completed planning application form and required fee and attachments (see also Section 16.12.030;

i.  At a minimum, the contents required by Government Code Section 65065.2 and the following: 
(A)  Duration of the agreement, 
(B)  Permitted uses of the property, including a plan of development, unless waived by the city council, 
(C)  The range of permitted density or intensity of use, 
(D)  The maximum height and size of proposed buildings, and 
(E)  Provisions for reservation or dedication of land for public purposes or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, 
ii.  Conditions, terms, restrictions and requirements for subsequent discretionary actions; provided that such conditions, terms, restrictions and requirements for subsequent discretionary action shall not prevent development of the land for the uses, and to the density or intensity of development set forth in the agreement. The development agreement may provide that construction shall be commenced within a specified time, and that the project or any phase thereof be completed within a specified time. The agreement may also include terms and conditions relating to applicant financing of necessary public facilities and subsequent reimbursement overtime, 
iii.  Such other provisions as may be considered necessary or proper by the city council to further legitimate city interests and/or to protect the public health, safety or welfare, so long as such terms are not inconsistent with the provisions of state law related to development agreements, nor are inconsistent with other city ordinances, policies or resolutions; 
c.  Two copies of a preliminary title report dated within the last six months. 
2.  Standard city planning and zoning provisions are available for the processing of normal development projects. However, the city recognizes that in specific and unique situations, it may be in the public's best interest to enter into a development agreement for the benefit of both the public and the developer. An applicant for a development agreement shall demonstrate the public benefits to be provided by the proposed development. 
3.  Planning Director Review. The planning director shall review the application and accept it for filing if it is complete and if it appears to comply with the applicable provisions of this section. The planning director shall forward a copy of the proposed development agreement to the city manager, city attorney, and staff advisory committee for review and comment. Upon receipt of the comments, the planning director shall determine any additional requirements necessary to complete the agreement application and shall prepare a report and recommendation to the planning commission and city council on the proposed development agreement, with any proposed amendments. 
4.  Planning Commission Review. A public hearing before the planning commission shall be noticed and held pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.12.160 of this title. Following a review of the application, the planning commission shall adopt a resolution stating their recommendation to the city council of approval, approval with modifications, or disapproval of the development agreement. 
5.  City Council Decision. A public hearing before the city council shall be noticed and held pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.12.160. After the city council completes the public hearing, it may accept, modify or disapprove the recommendations of the planning commission. It may, but need not, refer matters not previously considered by the planning commission during its hearing back to the planning commission for report and recommendation. The planning commission may, but need not, hold a public hearing on matters referred back to it by the city council. 
6.  Development agreements shall be approved by ordinance that includes the required findings of fact listed in subsection D of this section. All such development agreements are, and shall be, incorporated by reference into this title. A development agreement shall not be approved unless the city council finds that the provisions of the agreement are consistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan. After the ordinance approving the development agreement takes effect, the agreement may be executed on behalf of the city. 
D.  Required Findings. The city council may approve a development agreement only if all the following findings of fact can be made in an affirmative manner: 
1.  The development agreement is consistent with the goals, objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the general plan and any applicable specific plan; 
2.  The development agreement is compatible with the uses authorized in, and the regulations prescribed for, the land use district in which the real property is located; 
3.  The development agreement is in conformity with public convenience, general welfare, and good land use practice; 
4.  The development agreement will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare; 
5.  The development agreement will not, in respect to the subject property, or any other property, adversely affect the orderly development thereof or the preservation of property values. 
E.  Recordation. Within ten (10) days after the city enters into a development agreement, or any modification or the cancellation thereof, the city clerk shall have a copy of the agreement, modification or cancellation recorded in the office of the county recorder, which shall describe the land subject thereto. 
F.  Amendment or Cancellation. 
1.  Either party to a development agreement may propose an amendment to, or cancellation in whole or in part of, any development agreement. Any amendment or cancellation shall be by mutual consent of the parties, except as otherwise provided by this section, or as otherwise permitted by law. 
2.  The procedure proposing and adopting an amendment to, or the canceling in full or in part of, the development agreement shall be the same as the procedure for entering into an agreement in the first instance. However, if the city initiates a proposed amendment to, or a cancellation in whole or in part of, the agreement, the city shall first give written notice to the party executing the agreement of its intention to initiate such proceedings not less than thirty (30) days in advance of the giving of public notice of the public hearing to consider an amendment or cancellation. The notice to the property owner may be given by depositing it in the U.S. Mail, with first class postage, addressed to the party at his or her address last known to the planning director. 
3.  Except for clerical corrections that do not affect the substantive terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, notice of any proposed amendment or cancellation of a development agreement, in whole or in part, shall be given pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.12.160 of this title and subsection (F)(2) of this section. 
G.  Periodic Review. 
1.  The city council shall review the terms and conditions of the development agreement every twelve (12) months from the date the agreement is entered into for compliance by the applicant or his or her successor in interest. During this review the applicant or his or her successor in interest must demonstrate compliance with the terms of the development agreement. The burden of proof on this issue is upon the applicant or successor. 
2.  If the city council determines, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the applicant or his or her successor has not complied with the terms and conditions of the agreement during the period under review, the city may initiate proceedings as provided in this section to modify or terminate the agreement.

16.20.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter and any rules, regulations and specifications adopted pursuant thereto is to regulate and control the division of land within the city. This chapter is intended to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act concerning the design, improvement and survey data of subdivisions; the form and content of all required maps provided by the Subdivision Map Act; and the procedure to be followed in securing the official approval of the city regarding maps, lot line adjustments, merger of parcels, reversion to acreage and certificates of compliance. 
(Prior code § 9-04.010) 
16.20.020 - Applicability. 
    All land divisions in the city as hereinafter defined are subject to all of the applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this chapter. 
(Prior code § 9-04.020) 
16.20.030 - Consistency. 
    No land shall be subdivided and developed for any purpose that is inconsistent with the Arroyo Grande general plan or any applicable specific plan of the city, or that is not permitted by this title or other applicable city ordinances or provisions. The type and intensity of land use as shown on the general plan and any applicable specific plan shall determine, together with the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act and this title, the type of streets, roads, highways, utilities, and other public services that shall be provided by the subdivider. 
(Prior code § 9-04.030) 
16.20.040 - Authority. 
    The planning commission is designated the "advisory agency" (as defined in Section 66415 of the Subdivision Map Act) for tentative tract and tentative parcel maps, lot line adjustments, merger of parcels, reversion to acreage and certificates of compliance, and has the authority to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove such applications as set forth in this chapter subject to Section 16.12.150 regarding appeals. The planning director, city engineer, and staff advisory committee shall provide recommendations to the planning commission regarding these applications.

A.  Conformance. 
1.  The requirements set forth within this chapter are minimum requirements, and the city may impose greater requirements if so justified. 
2.  Exceptions from the requirements of this chapter relating to the design of improvements of land divisions shall be granted by the planning commission only when it is determined that there are special circumstances applicable to the property, such as but not limited to size, shape or topography, or conditional or existing road alignment and width. A determination shall be made that the granting of the modification will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare or be damaging to other property in the vicinity. 
3.  Applications for exceptions shall be made in writing to the planning director stating fully the reasons and justification for the requested exception and shall be filed with the tentative map. 
B.  Improvement Standards. Improvement standards for circulation, transportation and trails facilities, street lighting and tree planting, flood control and drainage, and underground utilities are discussed in Chapter 16.68. 
C.  Lots. 
1.  Lots in a proposed land division shall conform to the minimum lot area and width requirements of the zoning classification applicable to the subject property, and shall be consistent with the Arroyo Grande general plan. 
2.  When lots are crossed by major public utility easements, each lot shall have a net usable area of not less than three thousand six hundred (3,600) square feet for building structures, exclusive of the utility easement. 
3.  Side lot lines shall be at approximately right angles or radial to the street center line, except where terrain or other restrictions make such design impractical. 
4.  No lot shall be divided by a city, county, school district or other taxing agency boundary line. 
5.  The minimum lot frontage on a knuckle or cul-de-sac street shall be thirty-five (35) feet measured along the property line unless otherwise specified in the development standards of the zoning classification. 
6.  Flag lots shall be permitted, even though they do not meet the minimum lot width requirements at the street boundary line, only in the following instances: 
a.  The lot width of the stem of a flag lot shall not be less than eighteen (18) feet. 
b.  Flag lots shall be approved only when they conform with the existing character of the neighborhood in which they are proposed to be located. 
c.  The proposed subdivision is a parcel map that creates four or fewer parcels. 
d.  Flag lots shall be utilized only in infill areas. 
7.  Where the slope of a parcel exceeds seven percent, Table 16.20.050-A shall be used to determine minimum lot size. Land divisions proposing smaller lot sizes with common open space areas (clustering) shall be required to apply for a planned unit development permit.

* Building and grading not permitted. Subdivision only allowed for property commonly owned by a homeowner's association for open space purposes. 
D.  Exclusions. 
1.  Any contiguous property that is owned by the land divider shall be included within the boundaries of a land division when necessary or desirable in the design or improvement of the land division. 
2.  Any contiguous property that is owned by the land divider, but not included within the boundaries of the land division, shall be of such size and shape as to conform to the provisions of this chapter, the Arroyo Grande general plan, or any applicable specific plan; otherwise it shall be included within the boundaries of the land divisions. 
E.  Required Access. 
1.  No land division final map shall be recorded unless public access is provided from each parcel of the land division to a city, county, county service area, community service district, state or federal road that is maintained for public use. Public access to a road maintained by a property owner's association may be allowed if the city council determines that there is no other feasible means of guaranteeing maintenance of the road for public use, and if the association has the unqualified right to maintain the road pursuant to recorded conditions, covenants and restrictions which require the association to maintain the road and such requirement cannot be amended or terminated with the consent of the city. 
2.  The requirement for public access may be waived under the following circumstance: 
a.  If a parcel map creates four or less parcels and public access over intervening lands cannot be offered for dedication, and appurtenant private easements for ingress, egress, roadway, and public utility purposes may be approved, provided: 
i.  The land to be divided is not zoned for commercial, industrial or multiple-family residential uses; 
ii.  If no improvements are required, the private easement is no less than twenty (20) feet in width, and is duly recorded, is perpetual in duration, and is not subject to liens and encumbrances which might impair or defeat its purpose. If improvements are required, a minimum of forty (40) feet is required; and 
iii.  The access easement owned by the land divider is not an exclusive easement or specifically written to prohibit further subdivision of the land. 
b.  If a subdivision map has been previously recorded that permitted private streets without the requirement of offering the streets for dedication, a private road easement may be approved provided said easement grants the new lots unrestricted access rights to the existing private streets. 
3.  Public access is not required if each parcel created is forty (40) acres or more or is a quarter of a quarter section. 
F.  Design of Subdivision to Provide for Future Passive or Natural Heating or Cooling Opportunities. In order to provide for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in a subdivision, the following consideration shall be taken into account to the extent feasible: subdivision lot design, size, configuration or structure, orientation in an east-west direction, local climate, contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided, and other design and improvement requirements. Such provisions shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage of lot which may be occupied by a building or structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time the tentative map is filed. 
    These requirements do not apply to condominium projects which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building when no new structures are added.

Chapter 16.28 - AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS 

16.28.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The general plan recognizes the historic role of agriculture within the community, and its importance to the future of Arroyo Grande. The general plan thus outlines goals, objectives and policies regarding the retention of agricultural lands within and adjacent to the city. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide regulations that implement those goals, objectives and polices by providing for areas wherein uses are limited to agricultural and compatible pursuits and wherein development regulations restrict the intrusion of urban and rural development. 
(Prior code § 9-05.010) 
16.28.020 - Agricultural districts. 
A.  General Agricultural (AG) District. The primary purpose of the AG district is to provide for and protect lands for agricultural crop production, grazing, limited sales of agricultural products, and limited agricultural support industries and services. This district is intended primarily as an area for the production of food and fiber, but also permits single-family detached residential dwellings at a maximum density of 1.0 dwelling unit per 10.0 gross acres, as well as temporary housing for farm workers. 
B.  Agricultural Preserve (AP) District. The primary purpose of the AP district is to provide for and protect lands for which Williamson Act contracts have been or should be signed. Uses are limited to agricultural crop production, grazing, and limited sales of agricultural products. This district is intended for the production of food and fiber, but also permits single-family detached residential dwellings related to an agricultural operation at a maximum density of 1.0 dwelling unit per 10.0 gross acres, as well as temporary housing for farm workers. 
    The following conditions shall exist to qualify for an agricultural preserve contract under the Land Conservation Act of 1965: 
1.  The agricultural use is consistent with the general plan. 
2.  The existing uses conform with the A (agriculture preserve) district. 
3.  The property has been under agricultural production for a period of five years prior to the date of application for the contract. 
4.  The property shall consist of no less than ten (10) acres under single ownership or joint ownership. 
5.  Minimum contract length is ten (10) years. Requests from property owners for the establishment of an agricultural preserve may be considered at the same time as the petition for a zoning district amendment to the A (agricultural preserve) district. 
C.  Agricultural Preservation Overlay (AG-2.2) District. The primary purpose of the AG-2.2 overlay district is to provide for a mechanism to minimize potential conflicts between agricultural and nonagricultural land uses. This district is to provide for an agricultural buffer transitional area and requires that new development and changes in use require discretionary approval in accordance with Section 16.12.170(E). 
(Ord. 550 § 3, Exh. B (part), 2003; Prior code § 9-05.020)

Chapter 16.32 - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 

16.32.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The general plan outlines goals, objectives and policies regarding the character of residential uses and developments. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide regulations that implement those goals, objectives and policies toward the provision of a wide range of residential opportunities and dwelling unit types that meet the needs of present and future Arroyo Grande residents of all socio-economic groups. It is the further intent of this chapter to ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space for each dwelling; to minimize traffic congestion and to avoid the overloading of utilities by preventing the construction of buildings of excessive bulk or number in relation to the land area around them; to protect residential properties from objectionable noise, illumination, unsightliness, odors, smoke and other influences; and to facilitate the provision of utility services and other public facilities commensurate with anticipated population, dwelling unit densities, and service requirements.

The remaining forty (40) percent of the total area shall be devoted to landscaping, lawn and outdoor recreation facilities incidental to the development, such as, but not limited to, outdoor recreation game areas, putting greens, patios, walkways and fences. 
B.  Special Residential Development Standards. 
1.  Public and quasi-public uses within any residential district shall maintain a minimum setback of fifty (50) feet measured from the property line from any single-family district. 
2.  In any residential district, front yard setbacks in subdivision developments may be reduced by twenty (20) percent subject to approval of a conditional use permit, provided the average of all such setbacks is not less than the minimum required for the district. 
3.  In all residential districts, air conditioners, heating, cooling ventilating equipment and all other mechanical, lighting or electrical devices shall be so operated that they do not disturb the peace, quiet and comfort of neighboring residents and shall be screened from surrounding properties and streets. Additionally, no such equipment with the exception of ground mounted air conditioning, shall be located in the required front yard setback, street side yard setback, or closer than twenty (20) feet to any residential dwelling on adjacent properties. All equipment shall be installed and operated in accordance with all other applicable city ordinances. 
4.  Developments of five or more dwelling units in the SF, MF, MFA and MFVH districts shall be required to provide front and street side yard landscaping consisting of predominantly drought resistant plant materials, except for necessary walks, drives and fences.

2.  The minimum area for each mobilehome site shall be three thousand six hundred (3,600) square feet with a minimum width of thirty (30) feet. 
3.  Mobilehome parks existing as of the date of the original adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be deemed nonconforming by reason of failure to meet the minimum development standards prescribed in this section or Table 16.32.050-B, provided that the regulations of this section shall apply to the enlargement or expansion of a mobilehome park. 
E.  Additional Performance Standards for Planned Unit Developments. 
1.  When lot sizes less than those permitted by the underlying zoning district are proposed for a residential subdivision, a planned unit development permit application (Section 16.16.060) shall be submitted concurrently with the subdivision application. 
2.  Lot size, lot width, and lot depth for each unit shall be determined through the planned unit development review process. 
3.  Building setbacks required by the underlying zoning district may be reduced or waived for lots created through a planned unit development, provided the required setbacks are used for the perimeter of the project area if necessary to achieve consistency with the character of the district, and the lot coverage requirements of the district are met for the project. In no case shall the minimum separation between buildings on adjacent lots be less than ten (10) feet or less than required by other state or local laws; excepting, however, for adjacent lots where a common wall is shared in a zero lot line attached project. 
4.  For zero lot line projects where detached dwelling units are to be constructed upon a lot line, a five foot maintenance easement shall be provided on the adjacent lot, along, and parallel to, the zero lot line dwelling. The easement shall grant access to the owner of the zero lot line dwelling for purposes of maintaining the zero lot line wall.

l.  Open space shall be provided in accordance with Table 16.32.050-C and the following requirements: 
i.  The area of each parcel of common open space designed for active recreational purposes shall be of such minimum dimensions as to be functionally usable. 
ii.  Common open space parcels shall be located convenient to the dwelling units they are intended to serve. However, because of noise generation, they shall be sited with sensitivity to surrounding development. 
iii.  Developed Common Open Space. The planning commission and/or city council (if project is appealed or council is decision-making body) may require the installation of recreational facilities, taking into consideration: 
(A)  The character of the open space land; 
(B)  The estimated age and the recreation needs of persons likely to reside in the development; 
(C)  Proximity, nature and excess capacity of existing municipal recreation facilities; and 
(D)  The cost of the recreational facilities. 
iv.  Undeveloped Common Open Space. As a general principle, undeveloped open space should be left in its natural state. A developer may make certain improvements such as the cutting of trails for walking or jogging, or the provisions of picnic areas, etc. In addition, the planning commission and/or city council (if project is appealed or council is decision-making body) may require a developer to make other improvements, such as removing dead or diseased trees, thinning trees or other vegetation to encourage more desirable growth, and grading and seeding. 
v.  The planning commission may permit minor deviations from open space standards when it can be determined that: 
(A)  The objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and/or 
(B)  Because of peculiarities in the tract of land or the facilities proposed, it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards. 
vi.  Any lands dedicated for open space purposes shall contain appropriate covenants and deed restrictions approved by the city attorney ensuring that: 
(A)  The open space area will not be further subdivided in the future; 
(B)  The use of the open space will continue in perpetuity for the purpose specified; 
(C)  Appropriate provisions will be made for the maintenance of the open space; and 
(D)  Common undeveloped open space shall not be turned into a commercial enterprise admitting the general public at a fee. 
vii.  The type of ownership of land dedicated for common open space purposes shall be selected by the developer, subject to approval of the planning commission. Type of ownership may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: 
(A)  The city, subject to acceptance by the city council; 
(B)  Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their acceptance; 
(C)  Quasi-public organizations, subject to their acceptance; 
(D)  Homeowner, condominium or cooper-ative associations or organizations; or 
(E)  Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the subdivision. 
viii.  If the open space is owned and maintained by a homeowner or condominium association, the developer shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the association, to be submitted with the planned unit development application. The provisions shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
(A)  The homeowners association must be established before the homes are sold; 
(B)  Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any successive buyer; 
(C)  The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a period of years; 
(D)  The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities; 
(E)  Homeowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost, and the assessment levied by the association can become a lien on the property if allowed in the master deed establishing the homeowners association; and 
(F)  The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs.

Chapter 16.36 - COMMERCIAL AND MIXED USE DISTRICTS* 

16.36.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The general plan outlines goals, objectives and policies regarding the character of commercial uses and development. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide regulations that implement those goals, objectives and policies, and that are aimed toward the provision of adequate and appropriate commercial areas within the city. These commercial areas, or districts, must be conveniently located, efficient, attractive, and have safe and easy pedestrian and vehicular circulation in order to serve the retail and service commercial needs of Arroyo Grande residents and businesses. 
    In addition to the above, the commercial and mixed use districts are included in the zoning regulations to achieve the following purposes: 
A.  Provide appropriately located areas for office uses, retail stores, service establishments, and commercial commodities and services required by residents of the city and the surrounding market area; 
B.  Encourage the concentration of office and commercial uses for the convenience of the public and to secure a more mutually beneficial relationship to each other; 
C.  Provide adequate space to meet the needs of modern commercial development. This includes off-street parking and loading areas; 
D.  Minimize traffic congestion and to avoid the overloading of utilities by preventing the construction of buildings of excessive size in relation to the amount of land around them; 
E.  Promote high standards of site planning, architecture and landscape design for office and commercial developments within the city; and 
F.  Promote compact community design to enhance safety and reduce auto travel by providing shopping services, jobs and housing in proximity.

2.  The maximum allowable height for a building or structure within the P-D district shall be as shown on the development plan for the P-D district or as recommended by the planning commission. In no case shall any structure be of such height or location as to obscure any view due to elevation differential of building sites. 
3.  Accessory buildings within the P-D district shall not exceed one story and fourteen (14) feet in height. 
G.  Minimum Building Site and Lot Width. 
1.  Minimum building site and minimum lot width for any permitted use other than single- family residences shall be as shown on the development plan, or shall conform to minimum requirements as set forth in other sections of this title with relation to land use. 
2.  Minimum lot sizes may be reduced by two thirds, providing the area of reduction is devoted to common area, open space, green belt, or other recreational uses. 
H.  Maximum Building Site Coverage by Buildings and Structures. 
1.  The maximum coverage of a building site by all structures including accessory buildings permitted in the P-D district, but not including uncovered patios or swimming pools, shall not exceed thirty (30) percent for the P-D district, or as shown on the development plan. 
2.  Where lot sizes have been reduced as provided for in subsection G of this section, the maximum building coverage may be increased directly in ratio to the reduction of lot size. 
I.  Minimum Yards Required. The front, side and rear yard shall be shown on the development plan or as recommended by the planning commission. If front, side and rear yards are not represented on the development plan, then yard requirements shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in other sections of this title. 
J.  Fences, Walls and Access. Fences and walls may be shown on the development plan and approved or required by the planning commission in the P-D district. If such fences and walls are not shown, the following shall apply: 
1.  Fences, hedges and walls not to exceed six feet in height may occupy any side or rear yard, provided: 
a.  That such fences, hedges and walls do not extend into any required front yard setback, and in the case of a corner lot, such fence does not extend into the required side yard setback adjacent to the street. Such fences, hedges and walls shall not exceed three feet in height in aforementioned required setbacks, 
b.  That if there is over one-foot difference in elevation between contiguous buildings sites, the six-foot maximum height shall be a combination of the difference in elevation plus the height of the fence, providing that regardless of any difference in elevation, a fence not to exceed forty (40) inches may be built in such areas, and further providing that if written approval of the adjoining property owner is obtained, and a permit is obtained from the city community development department, such fence may be built to a maximum of six feet above the finished grade; 
2.  Fences exceeding six feet in height to enclose a court area, tennis court, or similar area, may be erected subject to obtaining a conditional use permit, if such fence is constructed of open mesh wire and is on the rear one-half of a lot: 
3.  A six-foot fence shall be required surrounding a swimming pool. Upon securing a conditional use permit, any such fence may be erected exceeding the required height in this subdivision; 
4.  Access to any parking area, ponding area, or public street shall be shown on the development plan. 
K.  Required Minimum Off-Street Parking. 
1.  All residential uses shall have a minimum of two garage spaces. 
3.  All other uses shall have off street parking provided as required by the provisions of Chapter 16.56. 
L.  Utilities. 
1.  Utility lines in the P-D district, including, but not limited to electric, communications, street lighting, and cable television, shall be required to be placed underground except that electric utility lines shall be required to be placed underground only to the extent required for so-called streamline installation. Where streamline installation is used, the service lines running from the transmission lines to each residence or other service unit shall be placed underground, and only the transmission lines may be above ground, on streamline poles which contain transformers. Transmission lines may be placed underground at the option of the developer or utility with the concurrence of the planning commission. Where transmission lines are placed underground, appurtenances and associated equipment such as, but not limited to, surface mounted transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts may be placed above ground provided such appurtenances are landscaped to the satisfaction of the planning commission. 
2.  The developer or builder shall be responsible for complying with the requirements of this subsection, and he shall make the necessary arrangements with the utility companies for the installation of such facilities. 
3.  Utility lines that do not provide service to the areas being developed, but which pass through or alongside such areas, may be placed above ground only after plans for such installation have been submitted to and approved by the planning commission. 
M.  Variation from Minimum Requirements. Variations from minimum requirements referred to in subsection (D)(2) of this section may be permitted in the planned development (P-D) district. The approval of any plan that requires such variations shall be approved by not less than a majority vote of the total membership of the planning commission upon a finding that such variations will produce any one or more of the following results: 
1.  Reduce the area and unsightliness of cut and fill banks; 
2.  Reduce the danger of erosion; 
3.  Create a better community environment through the dedication of public areas, rearrangement of lot sizes, or reforestation of barren areas; or 
4.  Create other improvements or permit the use of techniques which will produce a more desirable and livable community than can be obtained by strict compliance with such minimum requirements. 
N.  Grading. No construction or grading shall be done until both development plans and subdivision plans have been adopted as set forth in this title; provided, however, minor grading which is necessary for the enjoyment or safety of the existing use shall be allowed as a matter of right and subject only to city laws pertaining to grading. 
O.  Subdivision. In the P-D district, where from the nature of the size, location, shape or topography of the parcel of land, or where from the nature of the improvements of development shown on the development plan, or any combination of these factors, it appears to the community development director that a future division of ownership or subdivision of the parcel would be required for orderly development, the community development director may require the filing of a tentative subdivision map, as provided in the land division provisions of this title, and the performing of any other acts required in such regulation. Where any requirement of the land division provisions requires any specific act of the land owner or subdivider, the approval of any development plan shall not become effective until compliance has been made with such subdivision provisions. 
P.  Reversionary Clause. Any land classified as a P-D district shall revert to its former classification in the event that any portion of the development is not commenced within one year from the effective date of the ordinance classifying the land into a P-D district. If rezoning is initiated by the planning commission or city council, such reversion shall not take effect. 
(Ord. 522 § 2, 2000: prior code § 9-09.010) 
(Ord. No. 633, § 7, 6-14-2011) 
16.44.020 - Design development (D) overlay district. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. It is the intent of the design development (D) district to establish development standards to address special or unique needs or characteristics of particular areas (e.g., reservation of larger parcels for specific uses in a newly created subdivision, rezoning of land as the result of a specific conceptual proposal, preservation of uniform architectural, structural, or physical characteristics). 
B.  Authority. 
1.  The city council is authorized to adopt a design development overlay district only in conjunction with a base district. Adoption of an overlay district shall occur in the manner set forth in this title for amendments to zoning districts (Section 16.16.040). 
2.  When an overlay district is designated over any district, the standards used for that site shall be as set in the overlay district in addition to those regulations specified in the corresponding base district. In the event of a conflict between the regulations of the base district and the overly district, the provisions of the overlay district shall govern. 
3.  No overlay district shall be established unless the commission and council make, but not be limited to, the following findings: 
a.  That the area for which an overlay district designation is proposed has a unique character, identity or environment; 
b.  That the unique character, identity or environment of the are for which an overly district is proposed would be preserved and enhanced to the benefit of such area and the city as a whole by the provisions set forth by the overlay district. 
c.  That an overlay district is necessary to protect, preserve or enhance the unique character or identity or environment of the area for which an overlay district is proposed; 
d.  That an overlay district is necessary to protect the health, welfare and safety of the public.

3.  Any specific plan may be required to address other subjects that in the judgement of the planning director are necessary or desirable for implementation of the general plan. 
D.  Minimum Design Standards. All specific plans shall provide for development which exceeds the minimum standards and quality of development commensurate with what would be permitted under the existing district classification that most closely resembles the type and density of development proposed. 
    The following are considered the minimum standards and concepts acceptable for a specific plan. Each of the following shall be addressed within the text and graphic illustrations or design manual submitted for approval and a specific plan. 
a.  Lot development, alteration or enlargement shall be viewed not only as one or more free standing objects but also as part of a street, or cluster, or neighborhood within the entire community. Parcel or lot development should respect existing development, topography, views, general vehicle, pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian circulation, and the natural environment. 
b.  Natural features such as, mature vegetation, landforms, drainage courses, rock outcroppings, and views should be used to advantage as design elements. Conversely, undesirable site features should be minimized through proper site planning and building orientation. A discussion of view corridors and opportunities is required. 
c.  Placement of the building shall be done in a manner compatible with surrounding existing and planned uses and buildings. The setback from streets and adjacent properties shall relate to the scale of the proposed building. Larger buildings shall require more setback area for a balance of scale and to provide compatibility with adjacent uses. All buildings shall have articulated roof lines and fully dimensional roofs creating shadowing effects, physical offsets, and features of design such as interesting angles, projections, roof overhangs, and other enhancing techniques integrated into the building in a harmonious manner coupled with pedestrian amenities. All exterior wall elevations of buildings and screen walls shall have architectural treatment and articulation of elevation and recesses, which create shadow patterns and texture, and provide variety to the building plans or surface. At ground level, expanses of blank building wall shall be minimized through creative use of materials, textures, color and building form. 
d.  Access and circulation shall be designed to provide a safe and efficient system for vehicles and pedestrians. Points of access shall comply with city access regulations and shall not conflict with other planned or existing access points. The circulation system shall be designed to reduce conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian traffic, minimize impacts on adjacent properties, combine access where possible, and provide adequate maneuvering areas. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic shall be separated through the use of a continuous system of public and private sidewalks. Major entry areas shall be treated in a manner which reflects the architectural theme of the development and is compatible in color, texture and materials with adjacent structures. 
e.  Parking shall be designed to minimize visual disruption of the overall project design. Parking areas should be screened from streets through combinations of mounding, landscaping, low profile walls, and especially grade separations. The design of parking areas shall also minimize auto noise, glare, and increases in ambient air temperature. This can be accomplished through sound walls, screening with fences or hedges, trees, and separation of parking spaces and driveways from residences. 
f.  A unifying landscape design which is clearly identified and included as part of the specific plan is required and shall enhance the building design, enhance public views and spaces and provide buffers and transitions. Landscaping shall provide for solar access and for shade to facilitate energy conservation. Where appropriate, landscape design features such as color accents, specimen tree planting and decorative hardscape shall be provided to enhance roadway intersections, driveway approaches, pedestrian walkways, and building entries. A discussion of plant materials, minimum sizes, number of plants, placement and anticipated landscape budget for the project is required. Please refer to Chapter 16.84, Water Efficient Landscape Requirements, for rules and regulations regarding landscape and irrigation, including limitations on the percentage of turf/lawn that can be placed in landscape areas. 
g.  Fences and walls are discouraged unless needed for a specific screening or safety purpose. Where needed, fences and walls shall relate to both the site being developed and surrounding developments, open space and streets or pedestrian ways. The use of fencing or walls shall be consistent with the overall design theme of the development or adjoining existing developments; and shall incorporate landscape elements, changes in materials, offsets and fenestrations, color or texture in order to screen refuse facilities and prevent graffiti, undue glare, heat or reflection; and minimize aesthetic inconsistencies. 
h.  Adequate on-site lighting shall be provided to ensure a safe environment yet not cause areas of intense light, glare or spill over on adjacent properties. Lighting fixtures and poles shall be designed as an integrated part of buildings or complexes and placed in a manner consistent and compatible with the overall site and building design character. 
i.  On-site utilities and ancillary equipment shall be located in inconspicuous areas and screened with material or combination of materials which best suit the overall design theme. 
j.  Development should relate to the natural surroundings and minimize grading by following the natural contours as much as possible. Graded slopes shall be rounded and contoured to blend with existing terrain. Split-level pads, built-up foundations, stepped footings, etc., are encouraged in areas of moderate to steep gradient. The overall grading shall create differentials in building plotting and shall be used to break up straight visual lines by lowering parking areas and stepping site plans and building pads. 
k.  A recognizable design theme shall be established which is compatible with surrounding planned or existing developments and which is based upon prominent design features in the immediate area (e.g., trees, landforms, historic landmarks). Variations are encouraged which provide visual interest but do not create abrupt changes causing discord in the overall character of the immediate neighborhood. It is not intended that one style of architecture should be dominant, but that individual structures shall create and enhance a high quality and harmonious community appearance. 
l.  The architecture shall consider compatibility with surrounding character, including harmonious building style, form, size, color, material, reveals, overhangs and roof line. Individual dwelling units should be distinguishable from one another and have separate entrances. 
m.  The mass and scale of the building shall be proportionate to the site, open spaces, street locations, and surrounding developments. Setbacks and overall heights should provide an element of openness and human scale. 
n.  Colors, textures and materials shall achieve compatibility of design and to enhance architectural interest. They should blend well with the environment and not create inappropriate abrupt changes. 
o.  An integrated sign program or program for the entire specific plan area shall be provided. Conformity to applicable regulations, provisions for sign placement, sign scale in relationship to buildings and readability shall be considered in developing the signing concept. While providing the most effective signing, the concept shall also be compatible with the building and site design relative to color, material and placement. 
p.  All equipment, whether on the roof, side of building or ground, shall be screened. Wherever possible, a roof parapet or other architecturally integrated element shall be used to address this requirement. All equipment screening shall be architecturally compatible with respect to materials, color, shape, and size. The screening design shall blend with the building design. Where individual equipment is provided, a continuous screen is desirable. 
E.  Requirements Not Specified. Development within a specific plan district shall be subject to the requirements of the district that most closely resembles the use and intensity of use proposed unless expressly addressed and modified within the text of the approved specific plan. Determination of said district shall be made by the planning director.

7.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
8.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; 
9.  Implement general plan policies to enhance natural creek functions and values by providing erosion control, sedimentation prevention, enhancement of riparian habitat corridors, water quality protection and aesthetic and recreational opportunities. 
C.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses and Providing Creek Protection. In order to accomplish its purposes, this section includes the following methods and provisions: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, riparian habitat, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or degrade riparian habitat; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers, or incremental floodplain constriction which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas; 
6.  Creeks shall remain in their natural state and shall not be altered unless approved by the city council in conjunction with an application for a conditional use permit and permitted by other responsible agencies. 
D.  General Provisions for Creek Protection. 
1.  Applicability. The section shall apply to all creeks and drainage ways that are identified on the general plan conservation and open space element creek map. 
a.  Minimum development setbacks for creek yards and drainage ways: Development, as defined in this title, including fences and walls, shall be setback from the top of bank or edge of riparian habitat, whichever is farther from the creek flow line. 
i.  Arroyo Grande Creek and Tally Ho Creek: a minimum setback of thirty-five (35) feet. For Properties located within the Village Core Downtown (VCD) or Village Mixed Use (VMU) districts, through application of a conditional use permit and based upon consideration of recommendations from a Phase I Archeological Study; a biology report; and a hydrogeomorphology report, the setback may provide for an average of thirty-five (35) feet within a proposed project area but under no circumstance shall any portion be less than twenty-five (25) feet. 
ii.  Meadow Creek and East Fork of Meadow Creek: a minimum setback of fifty (50) feet. 
iii.  All other creeks and drainage ways: a minimum setback of twenty-five (25) feet. 
2.  Fences and other structures such as culverts, walls and bridges which must be constructed within the floodway shall be designed in accordance with all applicable best management practices so as to prevent an obstruction or diversion of flood and drainage flow and to minimize adverse effects to natural riparian habitat. Fences may be permitted in the development setback if designed to allow for wildlife passage and the unimpeded flow of water. 
3.  Clearing of significant vegetation canopy cover or herbaceous ground cover; removal of any native plant species within the riparian area is prohibited within the setback area. A tree permit may be requested for trees potentially affecting public safety. 
4.  Existing agricultural operations are exempt from creek setback standards established herein. 
5.  Exceptions to the requirements established in this section can be made only upon a finding that its application would violate federal and state law. 
E.  General Provisions for Floodplain Management.

i.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
ii.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
G.  Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. In addition to the development standards of the district with which the FHCP district has been combined and the standards contained in Chapters 16.48 and 16.52, the standards contained in this section shall apply. In the event of a conflict in the applicable regulations, the provisions of this section shall govern. 
1.  No fill shall be permitted within the one hundred (100) year floodplain of creeks or drainage ways unless appropriate mitigation measures are implemented in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the city's CEQA Guidelines and the following standards: 
a.  The fill is for the minimum area to accommodate a structure and allow for a five-foot border area which shall have a side slope of four is to one or flatter when no native riparian landscaping or erosion control can be provided; 
b.  All trees shall be protected or mitigated; 
c.  The fill will not encroach within the development setback area of a creek; 
d.  The fill will not result in adverse environmental impacts on the creek. 
2.  Standards of Construction. In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
a.  Anchoring. 
i.  All new construction and substantial improvements within special flood hazard areas shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
ii.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of subsection (F)(5) of this section. 
b.  Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement with special flood hazard areas shall be constructed: 
i.  With materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
ii.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
iii.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if 
iv.  Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
c.  Elevation and Floodproofing. See Section 16.04.070 for definitions for "basement," "new construction," "substantial damage" and "substantial improvement." 
i.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement:

Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator; 
(D)  For floodplain management purposes the term "lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement definition. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  The floodproofing standard, in subsection (F)(2)(c)(iii) of this section, 
(2)  The anchoring standards in subsection (F)(2) of this section, 
(3)  The construction materials and methods standards in subsection (F)(2)(b) of this section, 
(4)  The standards for utilities in subsection (F)(3) of this section. 
ii.  Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with subsection (F)(2)(c) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
(A)  Be floodproofed, below the elevation recommended under subsection (F)(2)(C)(i) of this section so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
(B)  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
(C)  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

d.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
e.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
5.  Standards for Manufactured Homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, AE, and AR on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, on sites located: 
i.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivisions; 
ii.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
iii.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
iv.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation, and shall be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement. 
b.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, AE, AR on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (F)(5)(a) of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist foundation collapse and lateral movement, and will be elevated so that either the: 
i.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
ii.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
    Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
6.  Standards for Recreational Vehicles.

i.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
ii.  Meet the permit requirements of subsection E of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (F)(5)(a) of this section. 
7.  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection (C)(2) of this section are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  If subsection (F)(7)(a) of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of subsection F of this section. 
H.  Variances and Appeals. 
1.  The planning commission of the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this section. 
2.  The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals regarding any decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this section may be appealed to the city council. 
3.  The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this section would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
4.  Review of Variance Requests. In passing upon requests for creek setback or flood management-related variances, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other subsections of this section, and: 
a.  Potential impacts to cultural, biological, and hydrological resources have been adequately mitigated based on consideration of a phase I archeological study, a biology report and a hydrogeomorphologist report; 
b.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
c.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
d.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
e.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
f.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
g.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
h.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
i.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
j.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
k.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
l.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
5.  Conditions for Variances. 
a.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of subsection E and F of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
b.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
c.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
d.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this section. For example, in the case of variances to elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
e.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
i.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
ii.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
iii.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
    "Hardship," as used in this subsection, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The hardship must be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. 
    "Public safety and nuisance," as used in this subsection, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal or basin. 
    "Fraud and victimization," as used in this subsection, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
f.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection (G)(5)(a) through (e) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
g.  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (G)(4) of this section and the purposes of this section, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this section. 
6.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level can result in substantially increased premium rates for flood insurance, as determined by their insurance carrier; 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
7.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
I.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Arroyo Grande are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.

(Prior code § 9-10.030) 
16.48.040 - Animal keeping provisions. 
    The keeping of animals is consistent with the rural lifestyle emphasized in low density residential development districts, and can enhance the small town, rural charm of these districts. To permit the keeping of animals and assure that their presence does not create an undue burden on neighboring residents, the following standards will apply, unless otherwise provided in the applicable zoning district. 
A.  The keeping of cats, dogs and other household pets for noncommercial purposes is permitted in accordance with Title 6, of this Municipal Code. 
B.  For noncommercial purposes, the keeping of the following animals shall be permitted in districts zoned RE, RH, RR, RS. No commercial slaughtering or processing shall be permitted in these zoning districts. The minimum site area of the parcel shall be as specified and the number of animals allowed is subject to the requirements of subsections D and E of this section. 
1.  Large animals: forty thousand (40,000) square feet. 
2.  Small animals: twenty thousand (20,000) square feet.

1.  Large animals: each large animal, as defined in Section 16.04.070, is equal to one animal unit. 
2.  Small animals: 
a.  Ten (10) poultry equal one animal unit; 
b.  Ten (10) rabbits equal one animal unit; 
c.  Two turkeys or other similar size fowl equal one animal unit. 
3.  The keeping of specific animals is subject to the following special standards: 
a.  Swine: the maximum number allowed is three sows and one boar. 
b.  Poultry: all poultry shall be contained in coops or pens and not be allowed to run free on any site. The maximum number of poultry allowed is twenty (20) (two animal units). 
c.  Rabbits: all rabbits shall be contained in coops or pens and not be allowed to run free on any site. The maximum number of rabbits allowed is twenty (20) (two animal units). These restrictions do not apply to rabbits kept solely as pets. 
d.  Turkeys: all turkeys shall be contained in coops or pens and not be allowed to run free. The maximum number of turkeys allowed is four (two animal units).

3.  All animal units are to be rounded to the next whole number. Fractional animal units are not to be used to calculate allowable density. (For example, five poultry would be rounded to one animal unit, and cannot be combined with five rabbits to equal one animal unit). 
F.  Questions regarding the classification of animals not specifically mentioned are to be referred to the planning director for a determination as to their appropriate category (household pet, small animal, large animal, or exotic or wild animal). 
G.  The keeping of exotic or wild animals may be permitted subject to issuance of a conditional use permit and any required fish and game permits. The keeping of animals in excess of the allowed density may be permitted subject to issuance of a conditional use permit. 
(Prior code § 9-10.040) 
16.48.050 - Conversion of residential structures to nonresidential use. 
    No structure originally designed as a residence, hotel or motel, or as an accessory structure or addition to a residence, shall be used for any commercial or office uses unless the building and site are improved to meet all code requirements for an office or commercial development. This includes but is not limited to building code, fire code, and zoning ordinance requirements. Such a conversion shall be subject to a minor use permit pursuant to Section 16.12.060. 
(Ord. 544 § 3, Exh. B (part), 2003: prior code § 9-10.050) 
16.48.060 - Development density. 
    The general plan classifications specify the maximum allowable development density per gross acre of land owned in fee by the applicant (including street right-of-way that would revert to the property owner if abandoned). Rounding up to the next whole number is not applicable when figuring density except in the multifamily district for fractional units of 0.51 or above, when calculating density for the provision of affordable housing, or for mixed use districts where rounding to the next half number is appropriate. Density for residential districts is discussed in Section 16.32.030(A). Density for mixed use districts is discussed in Section 16.36.030(C). 
(Ord. 584 § 3, Exh. B (part), 2007: Ord. 544 § 3, Exh. B (part), 2003: prior code § 9-10.060) 
(Ord. No. 630, § 4, 2-22-2011) 
16.48.065 - Mixed use projects. 
    This section provides standards for the design of mixed used projects. 
A.  Design Considerations. A mixed used project shall be designed to achieve the following objectives. 
1.  Potential noise, odors, glare, pedestrian traffic, and other potentially significant impacts on residents shall be minimized to allow a compatible mix of residential and nonresidential uses on the same site; 
2.  The design of the mixed use project shall take into consideration potential impacts on adjacent properties and shall include specific design features to minimize potential impacts; 
3.  The design of a mixed-use project shall ensure that the residential units are of a residential character, and that privacy between residential units and between other uses on the site are maximized; 
4.  The design of the structures and site planning shall encourage integration of the street pedestrian environment with the non-residential uses through the use of plazas, courtyards, walkways, and street furniture. Design amenities shall encourage travel by walking, bicycling and public transit; 
5.  Site planning and building design shall be compatible with and enhance the adjacent and surrounding residential neighborhood in terms of scale, building design, color, exterior materials, roof styles, lighting, landscaping and signage, to preserve the rural nature and small town character of Arroyo Grande. 
B.  Mix of Uses. 
1.  A mixed use project may combine residential uses with any other use allowed in the applicable zoning district by Section 16.36.030, provided that where a mixed use project is proposed with a use required by Section 16.36.030 to have Minor Use Permit or Conditional Use Permit approval in the applicable zoning district, the entire mixed use project shall be subject to that permit requirement. 
2.  For substandard lots, a mixed-use project that provides commercial and/or office space on the ground floor with residential units above (vertical mix) is encouraged over a project that provides commercial structures on the front portion of the lot with residential uses placed at the rear of the lot (horizontal mix). 
C.  Site Layout Standards. Each proposed mixed-use project shall comply with the property development standards of the applicable zoning district, and the following requirements: 
1.  Open Space. A minimum of three hundred fifty (350) feet of any combination of public or private open space shall be required for each residential unit and be permanently maintained; 
2.  Loading Areas. Commercial loading areas shall be located as far as possible from residential units and shall be screened from view from the residential portion of the project to the extent feasible; 
3.  Refuse and Recycling Areas. Areas for collection and storage of refuse and recyclable materials shall be located on site in locations that are convenient for both the residential and non-residential uses. 
D.  Performance Standards. 
1.  Lighting. Lighting for the commercial uses shall be appropriately shielded to minimize impacts on residential units. 
2.  Noise. All residential units shall be designed to mitigate impacts from non-residential project noise, in compliance with the city's noise regulations. 
3.  Hours of Operation. A mixed-use project proposing a commercial component within three hundred (300) feet of a residential unit, that will operate outside of the hours of from eight am to six pm shall require a minor use permit (unless the proposal involves a conditional use permit as required by Section 16.36.030(A)(1) to ensure that the commercial use will not interfere with the residential uses within the project. 
E.  Requirements for Use Permit Projects. A mixed use project that requires minor use permit or conditional use permit approval in compliance with subsection (B) is subject to the following requirements: 
1.  Property Development Standards. The approval of a minor use permit or planned unit development for a mixed use project may include:

16.48.110 - Nonconforming uses, structures and lots. 
A.  Purpose. This section is intended to limit the number and extent of nonconforming uses (including signs) by regulating their enlargement, their reestablishment after abandonment, and their alteration or restoration after destruction of the structures they occupy. In addition, this section is intended to limit the number and extent of nonconforming structures by prohibiting their being moved, altered or enlarged in a manner that would increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards prescribed in this code. This section also is intended to limit the circumstances under which a nonconforming lot may be reduced in size. 
B.  Nonconforming Uses. 
1.  Right to Continue a Nonconforming Use. A use lawfully occupying a structure or a site, that does not conform with the use regulations and site area regulations for the district in which it is located shall be deemed to be a nonconforming use and may be continued, except as otherwise provided by this section. Continuation of a nonconforming use may include a change of ownership, tenancy or management if the building, structure, land use or activity is substantially unchanged. 
2.  Nonconformity Due to Lack of Entitlement. Any use established at a time when permits or other entitlements were not required and is nonconforming only because of the absence of an entitlement shall not be modified, altered or expanded to occupy a greater land area without first securing approval of the required entitlement (i.e., conditional use permit). The use shall be deemed a conforming use upon securing the approval of such entitlement. 
3.  Modification or Expansion of Nonconforming Uses. 
a.  A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or extended in such a way as to occupy any part of the structure or site, or any other structure of site that it did not occupy at the time it became a nonconforming use, or in such a way as to displace any conforming use occupying a structure or site, except as permitted in this section, unless a conditional use permit request is reviewed and approved by the planning commission, pursuant to Section 16.16.050 of this title and if determined necessary by city council, a term of amortization or abatement is approved. 
b.  Single-Family Residences. 
i.  A detached single-family residence existing as a nonconforming use in commercial or industrial zoning districts may be continued as a residential use, subject to subsection (B)(4) of this section, and may be altered; provided that no increase in the number of dwelling units or increase greater than fifty (50) percent in the usable floor area, as it existed on the effective date of this title, occurs. 
ii.  A detached single-family residence existing as a nonconforming use in a multiple- family zoning district may be continued as a single family residential use and may be altered or rebuilt; provided, that the setbacks of the district in which it is located are met 
c.  Signs. Signs existing prior to February 13, 1987 that do not comply with the provisions in this chapter shall be regarded as nonconforming signs and the following provisions apply 
i.  Historical Signs. Upon written request by a sign owner, the city council may determine that a sign is historical based on the following findings: 
(A)  The sign is more than forty (40) years old or represents an important period in the city's history; 
(B)  The design of the sign is unique because its shape, colors, materials, or other aspects of sign design are indicative of the historical period within which it was constructed; or 
(C)  The design of the sign is unique because it is integrated into the design of an historical building and removal of the sign would jeopardize the historical integrity of the building. 
    Billboards may not be considered for historical sign classification. Historical signs may be maintained, reconstructed, modified or expanded consistent with the historical nature of the sign through the administrative sign permit process. New signs proposed on the property shall comply with this title and shall be complementary to the historical sign. 
ii.  Signs not qualifying for historical status shall be permitted to remain until such time as: 
(A)  There is a change in the use of the property on which the sign is located and discretionary approval for the change of use is required; 
(B)  There are alterations or enlargements to the site or building on the property in excess of twenty-five (25) percent or more of the existing site or building. The amount of alterations shall be cumulative over time; or 
(C)  Expansion, movement or modification of the sign. A change of copy or normal maintenance and repair does not constitute grounds for modification of a nonconforming sign. 
iii.  Any business with a nonconforming sign shall not be entitled to any additional signs unless the nonconforming sign is made to comply with the provisions of this chapter. This subdivision shall not apply if the existing nonconforming sign is located within the same commercial complex but at a different business location or if the existing nonconforming sign is not owned or controlled by the sign permit application or if the applicant is not the agent of the business that owns or controls the existing nonconforming sign. 
4.  Discontinuation of Nonconforming Use. 
a.  Whenever a nonconforming use, other than a sign, has been changed to a conforming use or has been discontinued for a continuous period of one hundred eighty (180) days or more, the nonconforming use shall not be reestablished, and the use of the structure or site thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations for the district in which it is located. Discontinuation shall include termination of a use regardless of intent to resume the use. 
b.  Whenever a nonconforming sign is located on property that becomes vacant and is unoccupied for a period of three months or longer, it shall be determined to be abandoned. Abandoned signs shall be removed. 
C.  Nonconforming Structures. 
1.  Prior Building Permits. Nothing contained in this title shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this title; provided, that the permit does not lapse. 
2.  Continuation and Maintenance. A structure, lawfully occupying a site, that does not conform with the standards for front yard, side yards, rear yard, height, coverage, distances between structures, and parking facilities for the district in which the structure is located, shall be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and may be used and maintained, except as otherwise provided by this section. Routine maintenance and repairs may be performed on a nonconforming structure. 
3.  Alterations and Enlargements of Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure shall not be altered or reconstructed so as to increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards for front yard, side yards, rear yard, height of structures, distances between structures, and parking facilities as prescribed in the regulations for the district in which the structure is located. 
4.  Restoration of a Damaged Structure. 
a.  Whenever a structure that constitutes a nonconforming land use, while being used as a single-family residence, is destroyed by fire or other calamity, by act of God, or by the public enemy, the structure may be restored and the nonconforming use may be resumed; provided, that restoration is started within one year and diligently pursued to completion; and provided further, that the restored structured does not exceed the square footage of the original structure. 
b.  Whenever any other nonconforming structure or other structure that constitutes a nonconforming land use is destroyed by fire or other calamity, by act of God, or by the public enemy to the extent of fifty (50) percent of less of the cost of replacing the entire structure, the structure may be restored, and the nonconforming use may be resumed; provided, that restoration is started within one year and diligently pursued to completion; and provided further that the restored structure does not exceed the square footage of the original structure. 
c.  When the destruction of any structure, except a single-family residence, exceeds fifty (50) percent or the structure is voluntarily razed or is required by law to be razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the zone in which it is located and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
d.  When a residential structure is voluntarily razed or is required by law to be razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the zone in which it is located and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
D.  Nonconforming Lots. 
1.  A nonconforming lot may be used for any use identified as an allowable or conditional use by this title, provided the minimum development standards established in this title for particular uses are satisfied. 
2.  Reductions in the size of existing nonconforming lots shall only be allowed with variances and lot line adjustments to increase the size of an adjacent nonconforming lot to allow its size or dimensions to be brought closer to conformity with the provisions of this title. Under no circumstances shall lots conforming to minimum lot sizes be reduced in size to a nonconforming status.

16.52.150 - Accessory dwelling units. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these standards is to ensure that accessory dwelling units located in residential districts do not adversely impact either adjacent residential parcels or the surrounding neighborhood, and are developed in a manner which protects the integrity of the residential district, while providing for needed housing opportunities. There are environmental and service constraints the city faces, which limit the addition of accessory dwelling units. In particular, such dwellings may not be appropriate on hillside lots because of environmental constraints. The addition of an accessory dwelling is limited by urban service capacity, public safety standards, traffic conditions, fire hazards, privacy impacts and compatibility with neighboring uses and structures. This chapter addresses these limitations. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  Accessory dwelling units may be permitted in any residential district, subject to the standards set forth in this section. 
2.  Accessory dwelling units may be attached to or detached from the main dwelling, but are not allowed on the second floor above the primary residence or garage unless approved through the minor use permit - viewshed review process. If the accessory dwelling unit is attached to the main dwelling, each shall be served by separate outside entrances. The interior wall(s) of an attached dwelling which separate it from the main unit shall be fire rated according to the most recent uniform building code. 
a.  An "attached accessory dwelling unit" shall mean a dwelling that is either combined within the living area or attached to the primary residence. 
b.  A "detached accessory dwelling unit" shall mean a dwelling that is not combined within or attached to the primary residence.

d.  "Primary residence" shall mean an existing detached residential structure that conforms with all applicable zoning regulations. 
3.  An accessory dwelling unit may be constructed simultaneously with or after construction of the principal residence. In addition, an existing principal residence may be considered the accessory dwelling unit, and a new residence may be constructed which would then be considered the primary residence, provided the standards set forth in this section are met. 
C.  Property Development Standards. The accessory dwelling unit shall comply with all zoning regulations and property development standards of the district in which it is located, existing building, health, safety and fire codes, and architectural review criteria, including, but not limited to, setbacks, height limits, floor area ratio, and maximum lot coverage. In addition, the following standards shall apply:

This requirement shall not apply to projects described in Arroyo Grande Municipal Code Section 16.52.150.C.7.a. 
9.  Driveway Access. Accessory dwelling units shall be served by the same driveway access to the street as the primary residence. Properties located on a corner of two public streets are allowed a separate access from the primary residence, provided that access for the accessory dwelling unit is from a different public street than the primary residence. 
10.  Utility Meters. For any lot zoned for multiple family or single-family uses, the accessory dwelling unit may, but is not required to, have an electric, gas, or water meter, or sewer lateral, separate from the primary residence on the property. Applicable utility and development impact fees for the accessory dwelling unit will be assessed at the time a building permit is issued, based on building area and fixtures added. 
11.  Conditional Use Permit or Minor Use Permit. Any proposed deviation from these standards shall be processed through a conditional use permit or minor use permit application as determined by the community development director.

A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these standards is to ensure that service stations do not result in an adverse impact on adjacent land uses, especially residential uses. While service stations are needed by residents, visitors and employees in this city, the traffic, glare and uses associated with service stations, particularly those open twenty-four (24) hours per day, may be incompatible with nearby uses, particularly residential uses. Mini-markets in service stations may cause greater impacts because they are more likely to serve people passing through the city from other communities than nearby residents, and they tend to attract a higher incidence of crime. Therefore, in the interest of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the city and its residents, special regulations are hereby imposed on service stations, consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the general plan. 
B.  Applicability. Service station uses may be permitted in applicable districts only with approval of a conditional use permit, unless a change of ownership or name or similar circumstance is proposed. All service stations shall comply with the property development standards for the district in which it is to be located, and with the special conditions below. The provisions of this section shall apply to all new service stations and to any expansion of twenty (20) percent or greater in floor area, or a remodeling, or any on-site development that would cost more than fifty (50) percent of the value of the improvements on the parcel at the time of remodeling, excluding land value.

3.  If total square footage for sales is to exceed ninety thousand (90,000) square feet, no more than three percent of total square footage may be devoted to nontaxable merchandise. 
    For purposes of the above calculations, only enclosed sales area will be considered. "Enclosed sales area" does not include restrooms, office space, breakrooms, backrooms, storage space, open-air garden sales space, etc. Conversions of such space to enclosed retail sales space shall bring the project under the restrictions of the above-described limits.

(Prior code § 9-12.170) 
Chapter 16.60 - SIGNS 

16.60.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    Signs have an obvious impact on the character, quality of life and economic health of the city. As a prominent aspect of the scenery, they either attract or repel the viewing public, and may affect the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Their suitability and appropriateness helps define the character of a neighborhood and the larger community. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate signs in a manner that will benefit the public and maintain a high quality of development throughout the city. The regulations contained in this chapter are intended to: 
A.  Direct persons to various activities and enterprises in order to provide for the maximum public convenience; 
B.  Provide a reasonable system of regulations for signs in order to ensure the development of a high quality visual environment; 
C.  Encourage signs that are well designed and pleasing in appearance, recognizing that a well-designed sign enhances a business's image and economic vitality; 
D.  Provide incentive and latitude for variety, good design relationships, and spacing of signs; 
E.  Encourage a desirable urban character that has a minimum of overhead clutter; 
F.  Enhance the economic value of the community and each area thereof through the regulation of such things as size, number, location, design and illumination of signs; 
G.  Encourage signs that are compatible with adjacent land uses and that provide pedestrian-scale atmosphere; 
H.  Reduce possible traffic and safety hazards through good signage; 
I.  Ensure the maintenance of signs; and 
J.  Implement the community design goals, objectives, policies and programs of the general plan, design guidelines for historic districts, and other applicable city guidelines and ordinances. 
    This chapter establishes the legal framework for a comprehensive system for the regulation of signs. It presents a set of reasonable, nonarbitrary, and nondiscriminatory standards and controls that are designed to optimize communication between the citizens and their environment, to facilitate the protection not only of the public, but the aesthetic character of the city, and to ensure the availability to the community of adequate, high quality signs. 
(Ord. 590 § 2, Exh. A (part), 2007) 
16.60.020 - Administration. 
    Unless expressly exempted in this chapter, no sign may be erected, displayed, reconstructed or altered until a permit is approved as set forth in Sections 16.16.170, 16.16.180, 16.16.190 and 16.16.200 of this title and a building permit has been issued or building department clearance has been received. 
    The four separate methods of planning review are established for the following reasons: 
A.  To provide a means of review appropriate to the magnitude of the proposed signage; 
B.  To recognize the planned character of large or multitenant centers; 
C.  To provide a means of flexible application of the sign regulations so as to encourage maximum incentive and latitude in the design and display of signs in order to achieve, not circumvent, the intent of this chapter. 
1.  Planned Sign Program. Planned sign programs shall be processed in accordance with Section 16.16.190 of this title. A planned sign program shall be required for the following: 
a.  Multitenant developments of nine or more separate, permitted uses, that share either the same legal parcel or building and use common access and parking facilities; 
b.  Projects or developments with a total aggregate sign area exceeding one hundred fifty (150) square feet; 
c.  Ground signs between twenty (20) and fifty (50) feet high; 
d.  Two or more contiguous legal parcels may be combined for purposes of calculating sign area and number, with the permission of the property and business owners and at the written request of the sign applicants. 
    The purpose of a planned sign program shall be to integrate signs with building and landscape design into a unified architectural unit, and to ensure the magnitude of the proposed signs is consistent with existing and proposed buildings and the character of the area within which the signs are proposed. This shall be achieved by: 
i.  Requiring that sign colors be generally compatible with building color; 
ii.  Using the same type of cabinet supports or method of mounting for signs of the same type; by using the same type of construction material for components, such as sign copy, cabinets and supports; or by using dissimilar signing that is determined by the approval authority to be compatible; 
iii.  Using the same form of illumination for all signs, or by using varied forms of illumination that have been determined by the approval authority to be compatible; and 
iv.  Requiring that signs not overpower buildings, and be of appropriate scale and character with existing signs in the general area. 
2.  Administrative Sign Program. Administrative sign programs shall be processed in accordance with Section 16.16.180 of this title. An administrative sign program shall be required for the following: 
a.  Multitenant developments of two to eight separate, permitted uses that share either the same legal parcel or building and use common access and parking facilities; 
b.  Projects or developments with a total aggregate sign area exceeding one hundred (100) square feet but less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet; 
c.  Ground signs between eight and twenty (20) feet high; 
d.  Minor tenant signs in older multitenant developments (regardless of the number of tenants) without an established planned sign program. 
3.  Administrative Sign Permit. All signs not required to have a planned sign program or administrative sign program must receive approval of an administrative sign permit if not exempt by Section 16.60.050. Administrative sign permits shall be processed in accordance with Section 16.16.170 of this title. 
4.  Mural Permit. No murals shall be painted without the approval of a mural permit in accordance with Section 16.16.200 of this title. Murals are not considered signs and shall not include the name, logo, or other representation that advertises a business, product, service or other commercial activity. Murals are considered a means to enhance the architecture or aesthetics of a building or wall and not a form of advertisement. If a mural is proposed that contains advertising materials, it shall be treated as a sign and reviewed pursuant to subsection (C)(1), (C)(2), or (C)(3) of this section and shall comply with Table 16.60.040-A. The mural permit process allows city review of murals to ensure that size, location and placement is consistent with the character of the district within which it is located; the character of the building or wall upon which it is placed; and that the mural is not detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(Ord. 590 § 2, Exh. A (part), 2007) 
16.60.030 - General provisions. 
    Unless exempt by Section 16.60.050, off-site signs shall not be allowed. Signs may be erected, altered and maintained only for those uses permitted in the zone in which they are located. Signs shall be located on the same legal parcel as the permitted use and shall be clearly incidental, customary and commonly associated with the operation of the permitted use. For the purposes of this chapter, a shopping center shall be considered a single parcel regardless of whether the center is comprised of more than one legal parcel. 
A.  Determining the Number of Signs. 
1.  For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing sign faces physically connected and having a coterminous boundary, with the following exception: combination canopy and under-canopy signs shall be considered as one sign. 
2.  A two-sided or multisided sign shall be regarded as one sign subject to the following: 
a.  A "V-type" sign shall be regarded as a single sign only if the two sides are separated by no more than three feet at any point. 
b.  Double-faced (back-to-back) signs shall be regarded as a single sign only if the distance between the backs of each face of the sign does not exceed two feet. 
B.  Computation of Sign Surface Area and Height. 
1.  All Signs Except Awning Signs. 
a.  The surface area of a sign shall be the total number of square feet calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, logo, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any frame, background area, structural trim, or other material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or surface against which it is placed, within a single continuous perimeter composed of circles, squares or rectangles. The surface area of spherical signs shall be the actual sign surface area calculated by the following formula: Area = 12.56 x r 2 ; where r = radius of the sphere. See Figure 16.60.030-A for an illustration of how surface area is calculated. Notwithstanding Figure 16.60.030-A, the community development director may allow an increase in sign area in rough proportion to the open area in a sign not comprised of squares or rectangles. 
b.  Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be included as sign surface area. 
c.  If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all of the area, including 
the area between the sections of modules, shall be included in the computation of sign surface area. Sections or modules must touch one another to count as one sign. 
d.  For multisided signs, the sign surface area shall be computed by including the total area of all sides designed to attract attention or communicate information. 
e.  For two-sided signs, the sign surface area shall be computed by including the total area of only one side; provided, that double-faced (back to back) signs have a distance of two feet or less between the backs of each face; or provided, that faces of "V-type" signs are separated by no more than three feet at any point. 
2.  Awning or Canopy Signs. 
a.  The sign surface area of a canopy or awning sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, logo, representation, emblem, or other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of circles, squares or rectangles. 
b.  If more than one surface of the awning or canopy is utilized for signage or if an under-canopy sign is attached to the main canopy, the aggregate sign area shall be calculated by totaling the surface area of each surface. 
3.  Height of Signs. The height of a sign shall be determined by measuring the distance from the average adjacent ground level within five feet of the base of the sign to the top of the sign. 
Figure 16.60.030-A 
Computation of Sign Area 

C.  Illumination of Signs. 
1.  All sign illumination shall be from the interior or by indirect lighting that shall be turned off after business hours, or at ten (10) p.m., whichever is later. 
2.  Neon tubing as a sign material shall be permitted to the extent that it composes twenty (20) percent or less of the total allowable sign surface area for the use as set forth in Table 16.60.040-A. Neon tubing used as an architectural detail is prohibited in the village core and village mixed use districts. Neon tubing as an architectural detail may be used in limited quantities in the other mixed-use districts subject to approval as part of a sign application or architectural review. All neon tubing used as an architectural detail shall be integrated into the design of the building. Visible neon tubing outlining the interior of a window shall be considered a sign. 
D.  Projecting Signs and Sign Clearances. 
1.  All projecting signs, except awning or canopy signs, must be double-faced. 
2.  An encroachment permit from the city engineer is required for signs that project more than two inches over the public right-of-way. 
3.  Projection Allowed. 
a.  No awning or canopy sign may project more than six feet over a public right-of-way. 
b.  No projecting sign may project more than six feet over a public right-of-way; however, the sign itself may not occupy more than four feet of the projection. The remaining two or more feet may be a gap between the building wall and the sign or the distance between the edge of the sign and the sign support. 
c.  The outside face of a wall sign may extend no more than twelve (12) inches from the surface of a building or wall. 
4.  All signs that project more than two inches over a public right-of-way shall have a minimum height clearance of seven feet. 
5.  No permit for any sign shall be issued and no sign shall be constructed or maintained that has less horizontal or vertical clearance from communication lines and energized electrical power lines than that prescribed by the laws of the state of California or rules and regulations duly promulgated by agencies thereof. 
E.  Accessory Signs. Signs that advertise products sold or services provided on the premises, such as beer signs or an automated teller machine (ATM) signs, shall be considered accessory signs and do not count towards the permitted signage listed in Table 16.60.040-A if they are restricted to ten (10) percent or less of the wall area on which it is placed. Accessory signs between ten (10) and twenty (20) percent of the wall area can be allowed with a recommendation from the architectural review committee, however areas greater than ten (10) percent shall be considered toward total permitted sign area. The design, number, location and size of accessory signs shall be reviewed and approved as part of an administrative sign permit, administrative sign program, or planned sign program by the architectural review committee if the following findings are made: 
1.  The proposed general design, arrangement, texture, colors, and lighting placement are consistent with the purposes and regulations of this chapter and any applicable design guidelines; and 
2.  The appropriateness of the proposed accessory signs are compatible with other signs and other structures on the premises and contiguous area and do not exceed twenty (20) percent of the wall area on which they are placed. 
F.  Incidental and Supplemental Signs. Signs that are incidental or supplemental to the use of the property, such as drive through menu boards or vending machine signs do not count towards the permitted signage listed in Table 16.60.040-A if they are no larger than sixteen (16) square feet. Incidental and supplemental signs between sixteen (16) and thirty-two (32) square feet can be allowed with a recommendation from the architectural review committee, however areas greater than sixteen (16) square feet shall be considered toward total permitted sign area. Incidental or supplemental signs shall not be legible to a person of average eyesight standing on any property line. The design, number, location and size of incidental or supplemental signs shall be reviewed and approved as part of an administrative sign permit, administrative sign program, or planned sign program with the recommendation from the architectural review committee if the following findings are made: 
1.  The proposed general design, arrangement, texture, colors, and lighting placement are consistent with the purposes and regulations of this chapter and any applicable design guidelines; and 
2.  The appropriateness of the proposed signs are compatible with other signs and other structures on the premises and contiguous area. 
G.  Portable Signs ("Sandwich Board Signs") that are allowed per Section 16.60.040, Table 16.60.040. A., must meet the following criteria: 
1.  Portable signs cannot block doorway, access, or Americans with Disabilities access. 
2.  Portable signs must be constructed from wood or plastic and have a professional appearance. 
3.  Only one portable sign is allowed per business. 
4.  Portable signs cannot be located on any public right-of-way. 
5.  Portable signs that are proposed for a store or restaurant located in shopping centers must be located immediately adjacent to that business. 
H.  Message Substitution. Subject to the property owner's consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any duly permitted or authorized commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message, provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message, if in conformance with the originally approved sign design, may be made without any additional approval or permitting. In addition, on non-residential uses, any display area for permanent signs, which is unused, may be used for display of noncommercial messages on temporary signs for a maximum of sixty (60) days in any one calendar year. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision: 
1.  Does not create a right to increase the total amount of permanent signage on a parcel, lot or land use; 
2.  Does not affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be property permitted; 
3.  Does not allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its mounting device; 
4.  Does not allow the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message or noncommercial message. 
However, simple face changes not involving off-site commercial advertising or changes to the physical structure or mounting device of the sign may be made without further permitting when the sign structure has already been permitted and is in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

a.  The sign is more than forty (40) years old or represents an important period in the city's history; 
b.  The design of the sign is unique because its shape, colors, materials, or other aspects of sign design are indicative of the historical period within which it was constructed; or

This subdivision shall not apply if the existing nonconforming sign is located within the same commercial complex but at a different business location, or if the existing nonconforming sign is not owned or controlled by the sign permit applicant, or if the applicant is not the agent of the business that owns or controls the existing nonconforming sign.

    When vehicular access rights from any lot or parcel to any highway or street are restricted, such rights shall be offered for dedication to the city by the appropriate certificate. A note stating: "VEHICULAR ACCESS RIGHTS DEDICATED TO THE CITY OF ARROYO GRANDE" shall be lettered along the highway or street adjacent to the lots or parcels affected on the final map. If a subdivision is not involved equivalent certificates and notes shall be required. 
(Prior code § 9-14.020) 
16.64.030 - Utility easements. 
    Any public or private utility easements required by any utility or the city shall be shown on the final tract or parcel map, or equivalent documentation if a subdivision is not involved, and shall be dedicated to the appropriate party by separate document. 
(Prior code § 9-14.030) 
16.64.040 - Drainage facilities. 
    In the event that a subdivision or development, or any part thereof is traversed by any major watercourse, channel, stream or creek, the subdivider or developer shall dedicate an adequate right-of-way for storm drainage purposes if, in the opinion of the city engineer, such dedication is necessary. In the event that the natural watercourse does not lie entirely within such dedication, the subdivider or developer may either construct an adequate channel within such dedication or delineate the course of such watercourse upon the final map or equivalent document if a subdivision is not involved. 
    If an artificial drainage facility is necessary for the general use of lot owners in a subdivision or users in a development not involving a subdivision, and for adequate drainage as may result from the development and its improvements, the subdivider or developer may be required to provide such improvements and shall dedicate on the final map if applicable or grant by separate instrument an adequate right-of-way for such drainage channel. 
    When storm drains are necessary for the general use of lot or parcel owners in a subdivision, or users in a development not involving a subdivision, and such storm drains are not to be installed in the streets, alleys or ways of such subdivision or development, then the subdivider or developer shall offer to dedicate upon the final tract or parcel map, or equivalent documentation if a subdivision is not involved, the necessary rights-of-way for such facility. 
    When property being subdivided or developed, or any portion thereof is so situated as to be in the path of the natural drainage from adjoining unsubdivided or undeveloped property and no street, alley or way within the subdivision or development is planned to provide for the drainage of such adjoining property, the subdivider or developer shall dedicate drainage rights-of-way adequate to provide in the future for the ultimate drainage of the adjoining property. 
(Prior code § 9-14.040) 
16.64.050 - Area drainage plans and drainage fees. 
A.  Drainage fees, pursuant to Section 66483, et seq. of the Government Code which provides for the payment of fees for the construction of drainage facilities, shall be imposed as a condition to the division of land or development of land for which a subdivision is not involved. Whenever land that is proposed to be divided or developed lies within the boundaries of an area drainage plan, a drainage fee in the amount required by the plan for the area, as adopted or thereafter amended, shall be required as a condition of approval of the division or development of land in that drainage area. 
B.  Each area drainage plan shall be adopted by resolution of the city council pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 66483 et seq. Such area drainage plans shall cover a particular drainage area, contain an estimate of the total cost of constructing the drainage facilities required by the plan, and shall include a map of the area that shows the boundaries of the drainage area and the location of the required facilities serving the drainage area. As a part of the adoption of a plan, the city council shall find and determine the following: 
1.  That the subdivision and/or development of land within the plan area will require construction of the facilities described in the plan; and 
2.  That the drainage fees are fairly apportioned within the local drainage area on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for subdivision or development, or on the need for local drainage facilities created by the proposed subdivision and development of other properties within the adopted drainage area. 
C.  Area drainage plans may provide for varying fees; provided, however, the fee as to any property proposed for subdivision or development within a drainage area shall not exceed the pro rata share of the amount of the total actual or estimated costs of all facilities within the area which would be assessable on such property if the costs were apportioned uniformly on a per acre basis. 
D.  Drainage fees shall be paid at the time of the filing of the final tract or parcel map, or at an equivalent time if a subdivision is not involved; provided, however, at the option of the subdivider or developer, the fee may be paid, in pro rata amounts at the time of the issuance of grading permits for the approved parcels or at the time of issuance of building permits if no grading permits are issued for the parcels. The amount of the drainage fee required to be paid shall be the amount that is in effect for the particular area drainage plan at the time of actual payment of the fee. 
E.  If the subdivider or developer elects to have payment made at the time of issuance of a grading or building permit, the recorded final tract or parcel map, or equivalent document if a subdivision is not involved shall specifically state that payment of a drainage fee is required to be paid prior to issuance of a grading permit or building permit. In addition, a separate instrument shall be recorded by the subdivider or developer in the office of the county recorder, at the time of the filing of the final tract or parcel map, or equivalent document if a subdivision is not involved which gives notice that a drainage fee is required to be paid by any person that owns such parcels prior to issuance of a grading or building permit. 
F.  If the drainage fee is paid at the time of the filing to the final tract or parcel map, or equivalent document if a subdivision is not involved, it shall be paid to the city engineer. If the drainage fee is paid at the time of issuance of a grading or building permit, it shall be paid to the chief building official. All fees that are collected shall thereafter be deposited into a local drainage facilities fund maintained by the city. A separate fund shall be established by the city for each adopted local drainage area. Money in such funds shall be expended for construction or reimbursement for construction, including a acquisition of right-of-way necessary for construction, of the drainage facilities serving the drainage area for which the fees are collected, or to reimburse the city for the cost of engineering and administrative services to design and construct and acquire any necessary right-of-way for the facilities. 
G.  At the discretion of the city council, considerations such as dedications of right-of-way, actual construction, or design work by a civil engineer may be accepted in lieu of the payment of drainage fees, upon a determination that the alternative is acceptable and is equal to or greater in value than the required fee. 
H.  Money may be advanced by the city to design or construct drainage facilities or to acquire necessary right-of-way within an adopted drainage area; therefore, money so advanced may be reimbursed to the city from the fund for the local drainage area in which the facilities are located. 
I.  When required for the implementation of an adopted area plan, an agreement may be entered into between a developer and the city, where the developer may advance money for the construction of facilities, or design or construct facilities within a local drainage area, provided that the sole security to the developer for repayment of money or other consideration advanced shall be money subsequently accruing to the local drainage facilities fund for the drainage area in which the facilities are located. Reimbursement shall be for the amount agreed upon in advance only, and shall not include interest or other charges. The agreement shall expire fifteen (15) years after the date it was entered into, and any subsequent money paid into the fund shall accrue to the fund without obligation to developers whose agreements have expired. 
J.  The drainage plan area, the required facilities, and the drainage fee in an adopted plan may be amended by the city council at any time upon a determination that it is necessary to do so in order to correctly reflect the drainage area, the required facilities, or estimated cost of the facilities. 
(Prior code § 9-14.050) 
16.64.060 - Parks and recreation. 
A.  Purpose. This section is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Government Code of the state of California. The park and recreation facilities, for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this chapter, are in accordance with the parks and recreation element of the general plan of the city, adopted by the city on November 22, 1988. 
B.  Requirements. At the time of approval of the tentative tract or parcel map, the city council shall determine, pursuant to subsection D of this section, the land required for dedication or in lieu fee payment. As a condition of approval of a final tract or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the city, for neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes at the time, according to the standards and formula contained in this chapter. In the event park and recreational services are provided by a public agency other than the city, the amount and location of land to be dedicated, or fees to be paid, shall be jointly determined by the city and such public agency. 
C.  General Standard. It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that four acres of property for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing with this city be devoted to neighborhood and community park and recreational purposes. 
D.  Formula for Dedication of Land. 
1.  Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the parks and recreation element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following formula (established pursuant to Government Code Section 66477 (b): 
Dwelling Type Zoning District Assumed Density Standard (Acres/ DU's) Single family SF 2.6 persons/ DU 4 acres/ 400 DU's  
2.  Dedication of land shall be made in accordance with the procedures contained above. 
3.  For this purpose of this section, the number of new dwelling units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the map when in an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel. When all or part of the subdivision is located in an area zoned for more than one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units in the area so zoned shall equal the maximum allowed under that zone. In the case of a condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number of condominium units. The term "new dwelling unit" does not include dwelling units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the final map is filed. 
4.  The subdivider shall without credit: 
a.  Provide full street improvements and utility connections, including but not limited to curbs, gutters, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees, and sidewalks to land that is dedicated pursuant to this section; 
b.  Provide for fencing along the property line of that portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land; 
c.  Provide improved drainage through the site; and 
d.  Provide other minimal improvements that the city council determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational purposes. 
5.  The land to be dedicated, and the improvements to be made pursuant to this section, shall be approved by the director of parks and recreation. 
E.  Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication. 
1.  General Formula. If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the city parks and recreation element, to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of that land, plus twenty (20) percent toward costs of off-site improvements, prescribed for dedication above and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of this section, such fee to be used for a local park, which bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future residents of the area being subdivided. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, "off-site improvements" are defined as those improvements that would have been required if land had been dedicated using the provisions set out in this section. 
2.  Fees in Lieu of Land - Fifty (50) Parcels or Less. If the proposed subdivision contains fifty (50) parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the land value, plus twenty (20) percent toward cost of off-site improvements of the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed herein above, and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
    However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes, in subdivisions of fifty (50) parcels or less, where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the city council. 
3.  Use of Fees. The fees collected under this section shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or rehabilitating existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision. 
F.  Criteria for Requiring Both Dedication and Fee. In subdivisions of more than fifty (50) parcels, the subdivider shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the following formula: 
1.  When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on the city parks and recreation element as a site for a local park, such portion shall be dedicated for local park purposes; and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions above shall be paid for the value of any additional land, plus twenty (20) percent towards costs of off-site improvement, that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
2.  When a major part of the local park or recreation site has already been acquired by the city and only a portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated, and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions above shall be paid, in an amount equal to the value of the land, plus twenty (20) percent toward costs of off-site improvements that would otherwise have been required to be dedicated pursuant to provisions above, such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreation facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the area serving the subdivision. 
G.  Amount of Fee in Lieu of Land Dedication. When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, value of the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land that would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to provisions above, plus twenty (20) percent toward costs of off-site improvements, such as extension of utility lines. The fee shall be determined by the following formula: 
DUs × Pop 
DU × FMV 
Buildable Acre = Subtotal × 6/5 =In Lieu Fee  
where: 
DUs = Number of dwelling units as defined herein above 
Pop. = Population per dwelling unit 
FMV = Fair market value as determined by herein above 
Buildable acre = A typical acre of the subdivision with a slope less than ten (10) percent and located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions. 
    Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be approved by the director of parks and recreation. 
H.  Determination of Fair Market Value. The fair market value shall be determined by the assessed value of all the land located in the city divided by the number of acres within the city limits. The determination shall be made immediately prior to the filing of the final map. The subdivider shall notify the city of the expected filing date at least six weeks prior to filing of the final map. If more than one year elapses prior to filing the final map, the city will prepare a new determination. For the purposes of this chapter, the determination of the fair market value of a buildable acre, as defined above, shall consider, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
1.  Approval of and conditions of the tentative subdivision map; 
2.  The general plan; 
3.  Zoning; 
4.  Property location; 
5.  Off-site improvements facilitating use of the property; 
6.  Site characteristics of the property. If the subdivider objects to the determined fair market value, he or she may appeal to the city council, who shall hear the appeal under the same rules and obligations current for local board of equalization hearings, except that the burden of proof shall lie with the subdivider. 
I.  Determination of Land or Fee. Whether the city council accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
1.  The natural features, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
2.  The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; 
3.  The feasibility of dedication; 
4.  The compatibility of dedication with the city parks and recreation element; and 
5.  The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways. 
    The determination of the city council as to whether land should be dedicated or whether a fee shall be charged, or combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
J.  Credit for Private Open Space. No credit shall be given for private open space in the subdivision except as hereinafter provided. Where private open space, usable for active recreational purposes, is provided in a proposed planned development or real estate development, as defined in Section 11003 and 11003.1 of the Business and Professions Code, partial credit, not to exceed seventy-five (75) percent, shall be given against the requirements of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof, if the city council finds it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following requirements are met: 
1.  Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; 
2.  Private park and recreational facilities shall be owned by a homeowners association composed of all property owners in the subdivision and being an incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only by a one hundred (100) percent affirmative vote of the membership, operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a charge for a proportionate share of expenses for maintaining the facilities; and 
3.  Use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes, by recorded covenant that runs with the land in favor of the future owners of the property, and that cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or is successor; 
4.  The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and locations; 
5.  Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreation element of the general plan; and 
6.  The open space for which credit is given is generally a minimum of three acres and provides all of the local park basic elements listed below or a combination of such and other recreational improvements that will meet the specific recreation needs of future residents of the area: 
a.  "Recreational open spaces," which are generally defined as "park areas for active recreational pursuits such as soccer, golf, baseball, softball and football," and have at least one acre of maintained turf with less than five percent slope; 
b.  "Court areas," which are generally defined as "tennis courts, shuffleboard courts," or similar hard-surfaced areas especially designed and exclusively used for court games; 
c.  "Recreational swimming areas," which are defined generally as "fenced areas devoted primarily to swimming, diving or both." They must also include decks, lawned areas, bathhouses, or other facilities developed and used exclusively for swimming and diving and consisting of no less than fifteen (15) square feet of water surface area for each three percent of the population of the subdivision, with a minimum of eight hundred (800) square feet of water surface area per pool, together with an adjacent deck and/or lawn area twice that of the pool; 
d.  Recreation buildings and facilities designed and primarily used for the recreational needs of residents of the development. The determination of the city council as to whether credit shall be given, and the amount of credit, shall be final and conclusive. 
K.  Timing of Dedication or Payment of Fees. At the time of approval of the tentative tract or parcel map, the city council shall determine pursuant to provisions above the land required for dedication. If the city council requires in-lieu payment by the subdivider, the city council will set the amount of land upon which the in-lieu fee will be based at the time of the final map approval. 
    At the time of the filing of the final tract or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land as required by the city council. Where the city council has determined that fees shall be paid in lieu of, or in addition to, the dedication of land, the city council shall set the in-lieu fees, based on the land dedication requirements as established at the time of the tentative map approval, using current land values at the time of final map approval, with the formula set forth above, and using the process for determining fair market value as set forth above. The subdivider shall pay the fees in accordance with the following schedule: 
1.  For any subdivision consisting of ten (10) or more lots, fees shall be paid in their entirety prior to the issuance of any building permit for any building or structure to be located upon any lot in the subdivision; or 
2.  For any subdivision consisting of nine or less lots, fees shall be paid on a lot-by-lot basis and prior to the issuance of any building permit for any building or structure to be located upon any one of the lots in the subdivision. 
    Open space covenants for private park or recreation facilities shall be submitted to the city prior to the approval of the final tract or parcel map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final tract or parcel map. 
L.  Disposition of Fees. Fees determined pursuant to provisions above shall be paid to the city and shall be deposited in the parks development fund. Money in this fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for acquisition or development of park land or improvements related thereto. 
    Collected fees shall be appropriated by the local agency to which the land or fees are conveyed or paid for a specific project to serve residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five years upon receipt of payment or within five years after the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. 
    If such fees are not so committed, these fees, less an administrative charge, shall be distributed and paid to the then recorded owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision. 
M.  Exemptions. Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this section; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit. 
    The provisions of this section do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivisions, nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives that consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building that is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. 
N.  Subdivider Provided Park and Recreation Improvements. The value of park and recreation improvements, provided by the subdivider to the dedicated land, shall be credited against the fees or dedication of land required by this section. The city council reserves the right to approve such improvements, prior to agreeing to accept the dedication of land, and to require in-lieu fee payments should the land and improvements be unacceptable. 
O.  Agency to Accept Land and Fees. Land or fees required under this section shall be conveyed or paid directly to the local public agency that provides park and recreational services on a community-wide level and to the area within which the proposed development will be located, if such agency elects to accept the land or fee. At the time of tentative map approval, the city council shall determine whether the city is the appropriate local agency. The city, county, or other local public agency to which the land or fees are conveyed or paid shall develop a schedule pursuant to Section 66477 of the Government Code specifying how, when, and where it will use the land or fees, or both, to develop park and recreational facilities to serve residents of the subdivision. 
P.  Access. All land offered for dedication to local park or recreational purposes shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street. This requirement may be waived by the city council if the city council determines that public street access is unnecessary for the maintenance of the park area or use thereof by residents. 
Q.  Sale of Dedicated Land. If, during the ensuing time between dedication of land for park purposes and commencement of the first stage of development, circumstances arise that indicate another site would be more suitable for local park or recreational purposes serving the subdivision and the neighborhood (such as receipt of a gift of additional park land or a change in school location), the land may be sold, upon the approval of the city council, with the resultant funds being used for purchase of a more suitable site. 
R.  Creek Dedications. For any subdivision or parcel map or development project requiring discretionary review abutting the Arroyo Grande Creek, including its tributaries (Tally Ho Creek, Spring Creek, Newsom Springs Creek and Los Berros Creek), or Meadow Creek, including its tributaries, the subdivider or developer shall dedicate to the city all the area that includes the stream bed and twenty-five (25) feet back of the stream bank, areas designated as environmentally sensitive based on a biology report prepared by a qualified biologist or other appropriate areas mutually acceptable for the purposes of "open space," flood control or "green belt." 
    Exceptions to the requirements established in this subsection can be made only upon a finding that its application would violate federal or state law. 
S.  Unbuildable Parcels. Any parcel that is specifically referenced in the safety element of the general plan as being unbuildable, or any area in the open space-conservation, safety, or other elements of the general plan earmarked for protection, shall be considered in the subdivision for open space and zoning and shall be either offered for dedication to the city or home ownership shall be management provided. 
(Ord. 527 § 1, 2001; Prior code § 9-14.060) 
16.64.070 - Local transit facilities. 
    The city may require, for subdivisions and other development projects, the dedication or irrevocable offer of dedication of land for local transit facilities such as bus turnouts, benches, shelters, loading pads and similar items. If a subdivision is involved, such requirements shall directly benefit the residents of the subdivision, and shall apply only if the subdivision as shown on the tentative map has the potential of two hundred (200) dwelling units or more if developed to the maximum density shown on the city's general plan and if the city finds that transit services are or will, within a reasonable time, be made available to the subdivision. 
(Prior code § 9-14.070) 
16.64.080 - Solar access easements. 
    As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the city may impose a requirement that the developer dedicate easements for the purpose of assuring that each parcel or unit in the subdivision shall have right to receive sunlight across adjacent parcels or units in the subdivision for any solar energy system. In establishing such easements, the city shall consider the feasibility, contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided, and cost. Required easements shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage of a lot that may be occupied by a building or a structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time such tentative map is filed. 
    At the time of tentative map approval, the planning director, shall specify: 
A.  The standards for determining the exact dimensions and locations of such easements; 
B.  Any restrictions on vegetation, buildings, and other objects that would obstruct the passage of sunlight through the easement; and 
C.  Conditions, if any, under which an easement may be revised or eliminated. 
    This section is not applicable to conversion projects. 
(Prior code § 9-14.080) 
16.64.090 - Reservation of lands for public facilities. 
    The city may require that areas of real property within a subdivision or other residential, commercial or industrial development for which a subdivision is not involved be reserved for parks and recreation facilities, fire stations, libraries, or other public uses subject to the following conditions. 
A.  The proposed use of the land reserved is in accordance with general plan policies and standards, any adopted specific plans, and all other provisions of this title. 
B.  The reserved area is of such size and shape as to permit the balance of the property within which the reservation is located to develop in an orderly and efficient manner. 
C.  The amount of land reserved will not make development of the remaining land held by the subdivider or developer economically unfeasible. 
    The provisions of this section shall only apply to those subdivisions and other residential, commercial or industrial development for which a subdivision is not involved which were filed and accepted by the city no more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the effective date of this title. 
    The city shall, at the time of approval of the final tract or parcel map, equivalent approval for other residential, commercial or industrial development for which a subdivision is not involved, enter into a binding agreement to acquire such reserved area within two years after the completion and acceptance of all improvements, unless such period of time is extended by mutual agreement. The purchase price shall be the market value thereof at the time of the filing of the tentative map or other equivalent development approval request if a subdivision is not involved, plus the taxes against such reserved area from the date of the reservation and any other costs incurred by the subdivider or developer in the maintenance of such reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering such reserved area. If the city fails to enter such a binding agreement the requirement of reservation shall automatically terminate.

4.  Upon the recommendation from the director of public works or the community development director that such requirement for undergrounding would be detrimental to economic development, affordable housing or the provision of other public amenities or benefits. 
D.  Reduced In-Lieu Fee. For projects that are eligible for consideration of in-lieu fee as set forth in subsection C of this section, the approving authority may require the payment of a reduced fee totaling between ten (10) percent and fifty (50) percent of the standard fee for any of the following: 
1.  The cost of undergrounding or the calculated in-lieu fee, separately will exceed forty (40) percent of the proposed project cost exclusive of undergrounding, as determined by standard construction estimation techniques by the building official or director of public works. 
2.  City initiated economic development and streetscape enhancement projects authorized by the city council. 
3.  Projects providing affordable housing units in excess of city requirements. 
E.  Calculation and Collection of Fees. 
1.  Underground utility in-lieu fees shall be calculated per linear foot of frontage for each side of the property with overhead utility lines on or off of the project property that would have been required to be placed underground. 
2.  Underground utility in-lieu fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the final map or building permit. 
3.  The amount of the underground utility in-lieu fee shall be established by resolution of the city council. 
4.  Underground utility in-lieu fees collected by the city shall be deposited in a separate fund and shall be used solely for the planning, design, administration and implementation of utility undergrounding. 
F.  Responsibility for Compliance. The applicant or owner is responsible for complying with the requirements of this section, and he or she shall make all necessary arrangements with the appropriate utility company for the installation of such facilities. When arrangements are made with the serving utility company, a letter stating that arrangements have been made for underground facilities and such other comments the utility company may have regarding easements, utility locations, and other pertinent matters must be submitted by the utility company to the city engineer. Plans and specifications for such utility undergrounding shall be sized to accommodate other utilities and are subject to the approval of the city engineer.

If the housing development is located within any redevelopment project area within the city, such contract, deed restriction, or other instrument shall be signed by the redevelopment agency as a party or, at the redevelopment agency's election, the contract, deed restriction, or other instrument shall identify the redevelopment agency as an express third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce the terms of such contract, deed restriction, or other instrument. 
E.  All affordable units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the housing development; shall be proportional, in size, bedroom number and location to the market rate units; and shall be comparable with the market-rate units in terms of the base design, architectural appearance, building materials and finished quality. All affordable units in a housing development shall be constructed concurrently with or prior to the construction of the market-rate units. In the event the city approves a phased project, the affordable units required by this chapter shall be provided within each phase of the residential development unless otherwise approved by the director of community development. 
F.  Applicants receiving density bonuses shall use best efforts to provide a substantial proportion of any affordable housing units in the housing development to citizens residing or employed within the city. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.050 - Incentives and concessions. 
A.  An applicant for a density bonus may also submit to the city a proposal for specific incentives or concessions in exchange for the provision of affordable housing units in accordance with this chapter. The applicant may also request a meeting with the city's director of community development to discuss such proposal. The city shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant unless the city makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following: 
1.  The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Section 16.82.040 (i.e., the applicant is unable to demonstrate that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible); or 
2.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact. 
B.  If the conditions of Section 16.82.030 and subsection A of this section are met by an applicant, the city may grant an applicant applying for incentives or concessions the following number of incentives or concessions: 
1.  One incentive or concession for housing developments that include: at least ten (10) percent of the total units affordable to lower-income households; or at least five percent of the total units affordable to very low-income households; or at least ten (10) percent of the total units affordable to persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development. 
2.  Two incentives or concessions for housing developments that include: at least twenty (20) percent of the total units affordable to lower-income households; or at least ten (10) percent of the total units affordable to very low-income households; or at least twenty (20) percent of the total units affordable to persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development. 
3.  Three incentives or concessions for housing developments that include: at least thirty (30) percent of the total units for lower-income households; or at least fifteen (15) percent for very low-income households; or at least thirty (30) percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development. 
C.  For the purposes of this chapter, available concessions or incentives may include any of the following: 
1.  A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the California Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be required that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. 
2.  Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing development if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing development will be located. 
3.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the city that result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. 
4.  For purposes of this chapter, the parking ratios set forth in Government Code Section 65915 (and Section 16.82.110 of this chapter) for qualified affordable housing projects shall be deemed a concession or incentive available to the applicant. 
D.  This section does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly-owned land, by the city or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. Nor does any provision of this section require the city to grant an incentive or concession found to have a specific adverse impact. 
E.  The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
F.  Applicants seeking a condominium conversion may apply for either a density bonus or an incentive of equivalent financial value (as that term is defined in Government Code Section 65915.5) in accordance with Section 16.82.100 of this chapter and Government Code Section 65915.5. 
G.  The application and review process for a proposal of incentives and concessions is set forth in Section 16.82.120. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.060 - Waiver/modification of development standards. 
A.  Applicants may, by application, seek a waiver, modification or reduction of development standards that will otherwise preclude or inhibit the utilization of the density bonus on specific sites in a housing development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this chapter. The applicant may also request a meeting with the city to discuss such request for waiver/modification. In order to obtain a waiver/modification of development standards, the applicant shall show that (1) the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible, and (2) that the development standards will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of Section 16.82.030(A), at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this chapter. 
B.  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the city to waive, modify or reduce development standards if the wavier, modification or reduction would have a specific adverse impact. 
C.  The application and review process for a waiver/modification of development standards is set forth in Section 16.82.120. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.070 - Specified density bonus percentages. 
A.  Only housing developments consisting of five or more dwelling units are eligible for the density bonus percentages provided by this section. The amount of density bonus to which the applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the percentage established in Section 16.82.030(A). 
B.  For housing developments meeting the criteria of subsection (A)(1) of Section 16.82.030, the density bonus shall be calculated as follows: 
Percentage Low-Income Units Percentage Density Bonus 10 20 11 21.5 12 23 13 24.5 14 26 15 27.5 17 30.5 18 32 19 33.5 20 35 (maximum)  
C.  For housing developments meeting the criteria of subsection (A)(2) of Section 16.82.030, the density bonus shall be calculated as follows: 
Percentage Very Low-Income Units Percentage Density Bonus 5 20 6 22.5 7 25 8 27.5 9 30 10 32.5 11 35 (maximum)  
D.  For housing developments meeting the criteria of subsections (A)(3) and (A)(4) of Section 16.82.030, the density bonus shall be twenty (20) percent. 
E.  For housing developments meeting the criteria of subsection (A)(5) of Section 16.82.030, the density bonus shall be calculated as follows: 
Percentage Moderate-Income Units Percentage Density Bonus 10 5 11 6 12 7 13 8 14 9 15 10 16 11 17 12 18 13 19 14 20 15 21 16 22 17 23 18 24 19 25 20 26 21 27 22 28 23 29 24 30 25 31 26 32 27 33 28 34 29 35 30 36 31 37 32 38 33 39 34 40 35 (maximum)  
F.  An applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus than that to which the applicant is entitled under this chapter. All density bonus calculations resulting in a fractional number shall be rounded upwards to the next whole number. The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
G.  For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the residential units do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the units for the lower-income households are located. 
H.  The application and review process for a density bonus as provided by this section is set forth in Section 16.82.120. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.080 - Land donation. 
A.  When an applicant for a tentative map, subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development approval donates land to the city as provided for in this section, the applicant shall be entitled to a fifteen (15) percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and land use element of the general plan for the entire housing development, as follows: 
Percentage Very Low-Income Units (Based upon maximum density allowed on donated land) Percentage Density Bonus 10 15 11 16 12 17 13 18 14 19 15 20 16 21 17 22 18 23 19 24 20 25 21 26 22 27 23 28 24 29 25 30 26 31 27 32 28 33 29 34 30 35 (maximum)  
    This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density mandated by Section 16.82.030, up to a maximum combined mandated density increase of thirty-five (35) percent, if an applicant seeks both the increase required pursuant to this section and Section 16.82.030. All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. Nothing in this section shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the city's authority to require an applicant to donate land as a condition of development. 
B.  An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density bonus described in this section if the city is able to make all the following conditions and findings: 
1.  The applicant donates and transfers the land no later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or date of approval of the residential development application. 
2.  The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low-income households in an amount not less than ten (10) percent of the number of residential units of the proposed development. 
3.  The transferred land is at least one acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of at least forty (40) units, has the appropriate general plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development as affordable housing, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure. The land shall have appropriate zoning and development standards to make the development of the affordable units feasible. No later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or date of approval of the development application for the housing development, the transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the development of very low-income housing units on the transferred land, except that the city may subject the proposed development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized by subdivision (i) of Government Code Section 65583.2 if the design is not reviewed by the local government prior to the time of transfer. 
4.  The transferred land and the very low-income units constructed on the land will be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with this chapter, which restriction will be recorded on the property at the time of dedication. 
5.  The land is transferred to the city or to a housing developer approved by the city. The city may require the applicant to identify and transfer the land to such city-approved developer, including but not limited to the redevelopment agency. 
6.  The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed development or, if the city agrees in writing, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed development. 
C.  The application and review process for a donation of land and related density bonus is set forth in Section 16.82.120. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.090 - Child care facilities. 
A.  When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that includes affordable units as specified in Section 16.82.030 and includes a child care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to such housing development, the city shall grant either of the following if requested by the applicant. 
1.  An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of square feet in the child care facility. 
2.  An additional concession or incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility. 
B.  A housing development shall be eligible for the density bonus or concession described in this section if the city, as a condition of approving the housing development, requires all of the following to occur: 
1.  The child care facility will remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the affordable housing units are required to remain affordable pursuant to Section 16.82.040. 
2.  Of the children who attend the child care facility, the percentage of children of very low-income households, lower-income households, or moderate-income households shall be equal to or greater than the percentage of affordable housing units that are proposed to be affordable to very low-income households, lower-income households, or moderate-income households. 
3.  Notwithstanding any requirement of this section, the city shall not be required to provide a density bonus or concession for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community already has adequate child care facilities. 
C.  The application and review process for the provision of child care facilities and related density bonus or concessions or incentives is set forth in Section 16.82.120. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.100 - Condominium conversions. 
    Any applicant seeking to convert apartments into condominiums may receive a density bonus or incentives of equivalent financial value (as that term is defined in Government Code Section 65915.5) upon an application made in conjunction with its map application pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act, this code and consistent with Government Code Section 65915.5. Any appeal of any density bonus or incentive of equivalent financial value or review by the planning commission to the city council shall automatically require an appeal of the underlying map to that body. An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or other incentives under this section if the apartments proposed for conversion constitute a housing development for which a density bonus or other incentives or concessions were provided under Government Code Section 65915. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to require the city to approve a proposal to convert apartments to condominiums. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.110 - Parking incentives. 
A.  Housing developments meeting any of the criteria of Section 16.82.030(A), shall be granted the following maximum parking ratios, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, which shall apply to the entire development, not just the restricted affordable units, when requested in writing by an applicant: 
1.  Zero to one bedroom dwelling unit: one on-site parking space; 
2.  Two to three bedrooms dwelling unit: two on-site parking spaces; 
3.  Four or more bedrooms: two and one-half parking spaces. 
B.  If the total number of spaces required results in a fractional number, it shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this subdivision, a development may provide "on-site parking" through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on-street parking. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.120 - Application and review procedures. 
A.  A written application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or modification pursuant to this chapter shall be submitted with the first application for approval of a housing development and processed concurrently with all other applications required for the housing development. The application shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the city and shall include at least the following information: 
1.  Site plan showing total number of units, number and location of affordable housing units, and number and location of proposed density bonus units. 
2.  Level of affordability of affordable housing units and proposals for ensuring affordability. 
3.  Description of any requested incentives, concessions, waivers or modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards. The application shall include evidence that the requested incentives and concessions are required for the provision of affordable housing costs and/or affordable rents, as well as evidence relating to any other factual findings required under Section 16.82.050. 
4.  If a density bonus or concession is requested in connection with a land donation, the application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide evidence that each of the findings included in Section 16.82.080 can be made. 
5.  If a density bonus or concession/incentive is requested for a child care facility, the application shall show the location and square footage of the child care facilities and provide evidence that each of the findings included Section 16.82.090 can be made. 
B.  An application for a density bonus, incentive or concession pursuant to this chapter shall be considered by and acted upon by the approval body with authority to approve the housing development and subject to the same administrative appeal procedure, if any. In accordance with state law, neither the granting of a concession, incentive, waiver, or modification nor the granting of a density bonus shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, variance, or other discretionary approval. 
C.  For housing developments requesting a waiver, modification or reduction of a development standard, an application pursuant to this subsection shall be heard by the city planning commission. A public hearing shall be held by the planning commission and the commission shall issue a determination. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65915, the planning commission shall approve the requested waiver/modification or reduction of development standards, unless one of the following conditions applies: 
1.  The waiver/modification is not required to make the proposed affordable housing units feasible; or 
2.  The waiver/modification will have a specific adverse impact. 
    The decision of the city planning commission may be appealed to the city council within fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days of the date the decision is made in the manner provided in Arroyo Grande Municipal Code. 
D.  Notice of any city determination pursuant to this section shall be provided to the same extent as required for the underlying development approval. 
(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 2007) 
16.82.130 - State law amendments. 
    This chapter implements the laws for density bonuses and other incentive and concessions available to qualified applicants under Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918. In the event these Government Code sections are amended, those amended provisions shall be incorporated into this chapter as if fully set forth herein. Should any inconsistencies exist between the amended state law and the provisions set forth in this chapter, the amended state law shall prevail.
