(a)   The Chief of Police or designee, may, without a public hearing and based on the facts available to him or her, declare a dog to be a dangerous dog based on any one of the following guidelines:

(1)   The nature of any attack committed or wound inflicted by the animal and the need to put the community and owner on notice that the dog has displayed the propensity to inflict wounds or engage in aggressive or menacing behavior; or

(2)   The past history and seriousness of any attacks or wounds inflicted by the animal; or

(3)   The dog has exhibited an aggressive and vicious propensity toward persons or domestic animals and is capable of inflicting serious physical harm or death or damage to property; or

(4)   The conditions under which the animal is kept and maintained which could contribute to, encourage, or facilitate aggressive behavior, such as, but not limited to, allowing the animal to run at large, physical property conditions, presence of young children, the elderly, or infirm within or residing near the home, any past violations of this Article, and/or failing to provide adequate care, health care, food, shelter, or water; or

(5)   Whether the dog was owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of dog fighting, or any dog trained for dog fighting; or

(6)   Whether the dog has been or is adjudicated to be any degree of dangerous by the City any other jurisdiction.

(7)   In determining whether to deem a dog to be a dangerous dog, the factfinder may consider potentially mitigating circumstances such as whether the bite or scratch was made in a playful manner without any sign of aggression or whether it was a response to pain, abuse, criminal trespass, and intentional provocation.

(b)   If a dog is deemed to be a dangerous dog, the level shall be specified as "potentially dangerous" or dangerous level 1, 2, or 3 based on the nature of the attack or wound combined with the totality of circumstances. The guidelines per level are advisory in nature and shall not bind the factfinder to a particular level if the totality of circumstances warrants a higher or lower level.

(1)   Potentially Dangerous: A minor bite, nip, scratch or abrasion where skin contact or nicks may be evident but no vertical puncture wound exists; or a bite that requires medical treatment, but no attack or aggressive behavior towards the human occurs; or an attack, without an actual bite, which inhibits movement and/or otherwise qualifies as an “attack” pursuant to 2-502(c).

(2)   Level 1: Any attack as defined by 2-502(c) or bite in an aggressive manner that pierces the skin; or any attack or bite subsequent to being deemed a dangerous dog on a prior occasion.

(3)   Level 2: Any attack or bite that is incident to an attack which involves predatory aggressive behavior toward a human or other domesticated animal while running at large, including, but not limited to: chasing, stalking, circling, inhibiting movement, predatory or aggressive pack behavior; or any bite subsequent to being deemed a dangerous dog on a prior occasion.

(4)   Level 3: Any severe bite to a human requiring significant medical attention, wound closure, or other emergency medical attention; or an attack or bite with a demonstrated history of bites or attacks; or repeated non-compliance with Police requirements that indicates a risk to the public; or circumstances otherwise indicating a pronounced and obvious risk to public health or safety.

(c)   If a dog is deemed to be a dangerous dog, the conditions may be required of the dog's owner or harborer to guarantee the safety of the public including, but not limited to, attendance at an approved education course, canine aggression workshop or management plan, sterilization, liability insurance, or safety equipment.

(d)   The following conditions are minimum requirements that shall be ordered at each level:

(1)   Potentially dangerous requirements: mandatory signage and registration in accordance with 2-506(f) and microchipping in accordance with 2-502(h) and 2-506(e).  If there are no further incidents or indications of aggression, either charged in court or uncharged, and all requirements have been met, upon application in writing by the owner to the Chief of Police, the potentially dangerous dog designation and all restrictions that accompany it, may be removed after 24 months. The decision to lift the designation is at the discretion of the Chief of Police or designee.

If there are no further incidents or indications of aggression, either charged in court or uncharged, and all requirements have been met, upon application in writing by the owner to the Chief of Police, the level 1 dangerous dog designation and all restrictions that accompany it, may be removed after 36 months. The decision to lift the designation is at the discretion of the Chief of Police or designee. The designation may never be removed from a Level 2 dangerous dog determination.

(3)   Level 3 requirement: Euthanasia is mandatory.

(e)   A dog that is harbored or maintained outside the city limits of Andover, but has committed acts either beyond or within the city limits of Andover that would deem it dangerous or potentially dangerous, may be deemed to be a dangerous dog under this Article and any orders made pursuant to that determination will apply if the dog enters the city limits of Andover.

(f)   Notification procedure.  If the Chief of Police or designee determines that a dog is a dangerous dog, he or she will determine an appropriate disposition based on the known facts and consistent with the provisions of this Article. The Chief of Police or a designee may impound the dangerous dog and shall notify the owner of such determination by personal service, residential service at the person's usual place of abode by leaving a copy of the notice with some person of suitable age and discretion residing therein, or by certified mail addressed to the owner's last known address, or addressed to the location where the dog is maintained. If service is by certified mail Andover Police shall request return receipt with instructions to the delivering postal employee to show to whom delivered, the date of delivery, and address where delivered. Service of process by certified mail shall be considered obtained upon the delivery. If the certified mail envelope is returned with an endorsement showing refusal of delivery, the Chief of Police or designee shall send a copy of the notice to the defendant by ordinary, first class mail.

When the noise emitted is measured upon property which is located in a different land use category than the property upon which the stationary noise source is located, the levels applicable to the property where the noise emitted is measured shall be used to determine if a violation exists.  If more than one use exists on the property where the noise emitted is measured such that more than one land use category would be applicable to the property, then the levels set forth in the least restrictive applicable land use category of Table I shall be used to determine if a violation exists.

(b)   If the stationary noise source emits noise containing a discrete tone, the permissible levels shall be 5dB lower than the applicable levels of Table I.

(c)   If the stationary noise source emits impulsive noise, the levels of Table I shall be lowered by 5 dB. A violation of this Code shall exist if the level of the impulsive noise emitted exceeds the applicable levels of Table I, as modified by this Subsection, when the measurement is made using the fast meter characteristic and the A-weighting network of the sound level meter.

(d)   In the event the stationary noise source emits impulsive noise containing a discrete tone, the modifications of Table I set forth in subsections (b) and (c) herein shall be cumulative.

(Ord. 119, Sec. 3, 5; Code 2011)

16-413.      Prohibited sewer conditions.

It is hereby declared that any connection to be made which permits the infiltration of surface waters into said sewer system or the seepage of sewage affluent from said sewer system into the adjacent soil structure shall be prohibited, and those parties charged with the inspection shall not approve such sewer connection or any other sewer connection to private property which endangers the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Andover, Kansas; or permits the infiltration of any sewage other than that normally contemplated in a sanitary sewer system, including but not limited to, surface water and any other sewage which would overload or be destructive to the sanitary sewer system of said city.

The failure of the property owner to make such repairs within 10 days after being directed to do so by the Director of Public Works shall authorize the City to affect such repairs on behalf of the property owner.  The costs of such repairs shall be payable to the City of the property owner within 30 days following submission of a statement of expenses to the property owner by the City.  Upon the failure of the property owner to pay the amount of such statement, the City may certify such indebtedness to the County Clerk and the same shall constitute a special tax to be assessed against the property improved by such repairs.

ARTICLE 6.   SEWER CONNECTION CHARGE

16-601.      Sewer connection charge.

That there shall be hereby charged a sewer connection charge for each separate sewer connection hereafter made to the Sanitary Sewer System of said City of Andover in the amount of $75.00 for each such connection.

In the event that the Governing Body should determine that any certain single connection of a single sewer to the sanitary sewer system of said City which supplies more than one user does not require substantially more inspection procedures than the same would be serving only one user then such connection may be made for a single sewer connection charge of $75.00 for the single structure.  Before such determination can be made, it must appear to the Governing Body on application of the owner or his agent that only one connection is being made to the sanitary sewer system of said City or to an existing private sewer line already connected with the said sanitary sewer system of said City.

(Ord. 288, Sec. 1)

16-602.      Inspection service charge.

The violation of any provision within Chapter XVI of said Code shall constitute a misdemeanor and such violator shall be assessed a penalty of up to $500.00 and may be incarcerated in the county jail for up to a period of 6 months on account of each such violation.

(Ord. 578)

ARTICLE 7.   SEWER CONNECTION SURCHARGE

16-701.      Purpose.

The very nature of the wastewater utility requires the construction of excess capacity within the utility well in advance of the need. This requires substantial capital investment which results in a net equity for the utility.  Each new customer who ties onto the utility's system receives the full use of his own proportionate share of the utility and thereby benefits by his own proportionate share of the utility's equity.  Each new customer is, therefore, assessed a tie-on fee equal to his own proportionate share of the utility's equity.  This tie-on fee represents the new customer's cost of buying into the utility service so that his own investment in the utility equates the investments already made by others.

16-702.      Assessment.

There is hereby imposed a sewer connection surcharge (that is, a charge in addition to that levied by any other ordinance for the connection to the sanitary sewer system of said City) upon each new sanitary sewer connection hereinafter made to provide sanitary sewer service to any lot or piece of ground which has not previously been assessed said tie-on fee, prior to May 1, 2002.

(a)   Residential Basis

That for the purpose of establishing just and equitable sewer connection for the provision of sanitary sewer service by the wastewater utility of said City to users both inside and outside the corporate limits of said City, the Governing Body hereby establishes that, based upon studies of water usage within said City and other data, it is determined that each residential unit (for the purpose of this Section 16-702, each separate family dwelling unit, even when within a common structure be it a duplex, triplex, fourplex, condominium, apartment, or mobile home, shall be considered a separate connection and will be subject separate and individual charges) connecting to the sanitary sewer of said City, shall be assessed a tie-on fee of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) and that such determination is based upon an average residential use of water at the rate of 6,000 gallons per month, which fee and usage shall be referred to as “base tie-on fee” and “base usage.”

The residential base tie-on fee shall be due for any residential property proposing to connect to the City sewer service upon the approval of the application for connection. In the alternative, if the subject property necessitating a connection to City sewer is part of a previously existing residential development which has thereafter become part of a benefit district now liable for special assessment for sewer improvements pursuant to K.S.A. 12-6a01 or similar provisions of state law, the governing body of the City may, in its sole discretion, defer the residential base tie-on fee. If deferred, the residential base tie-on fee, together with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at a rate equal to the average annual interest rate on the general obligation bonds otherwise paying the costs of the related sewer improvements, shall be levied and assessed and will be collected at such time as is customary for, the levying and collecting of ad valorem property taxes, and the taxes so collected will be used for the purpose of paying the deferred residential base tie-on fee.

The City Clerk of the City shall from time to time, as necessary, certify to the County Clerk of the appropriate county, the legal description of the real property liable for any residential base tie-on fee, along with the sum of any delinquent charges, including interest accrued, to be placed upon the tax rolls for collection. Upon such certification said charges shall become a lien against the property upon which they are certified, subject to the same penalties and collected in the same manner as taxes levied against the property are by law collectible. The procedure outlined in this paragraph shall be construed as being in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas and any provision herein deemed or finally determined to be contrary to the laws of Kansas shall be void, provided that in such event the remaining provisions of this section (including the property owner's liability for the base tie-on fee) shall remain in full force and effect.

(b)   Non-Residential

Based upon such base tie-on fees and base usages aforesaid, the sewer tie-on fee for other classifications and usages in said City is hereby found and established to be as follows:

For each manufacturing, industrial, commercial, school, or multi-use, excepting any category or other such usage provided for hereinafter, the initial sewer service tie-on fee shall be 75% of the base tie-on fee of One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,250.00) for each 6,000 gallons of projected water use on the premises as determined by said City through the use of such data and information as is available at time of such connection. A secondary tie-on fee shall be determined within 18 months of the assessment of the initial fee and shall be based upon the base tie-on fee of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) for each 6,000 gallons of actual water used on the premises as determined by the records of the Water Department of the City of Wichita, and in the office of the City Clerk of Andover, Kansas, and an assessment made for this amount minus any tie-on fees already paid.

That as hereinafter provided, the Governing Body may review such fees from time to time and take into consideration other matters such as quantity of industrial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer, water used and evaporated for cooling purposes, and any and all other factors which may tend to raise or lower the fees charged such classification, and direct the City Clerk to adjust or to change the fee for such user in this classification in accordance with the findings of the Governing Body.

(c)   Metering.

All new users falling within a “b” classification as set forth immediately hereinabove shall be required to meter all water to be discharged to said City's sanitary sewer system and shall be forbidden to discharge any unmetered flows to said City, subject to penalty as prescribed by 16-106. Metering costs shall be borne by the owner. The meter must be available for reading by City personnel.

(d)   Meter Data Interpretation.

Water use data shall be obtained for any nonresidential user known, or believed to be using, in excess of 12,000 gallons per month. The highest 50% of the meter readings shall not be used for fee assessment unless other information warrants the use of that data. The usable data shall then be converted to an average monthly usage.

(e)   Subsidization of Commercial Businesses

All new users within a “b” classification as set forth immediately hereinabove shall be granted a subsidy in the amount of:

4% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate of 30,000-60,000 gal./mo.

8% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate of 60,001-90,000 gal./mo.

12% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate of 90,001-120,000 gal./mo.

16% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate of 120,001-150,000 gal./mo.

20% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate of 180,001-210,000 gal./mo.

24% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate of 240,001-270,000 gal./mo.

28% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate of 270,001-300,000 gal./mo.

30% of the user's assessed fee for usage rate above 300,000 gal./mo.

This subsidy shall be issued only in the form of a credit against the assessed tie-on fee at the time of billing.

(Ord. 530; Ord. 1168; Ord. 1303; Code 2011)

16-703.      County surcharge.

For each separate new sewer connection to the City's sanitary sewer system, outside the corporate limits of said City, where such lot or piece of ground sought to be connected has not previously been assessed and paid said tie-on fee, a base surcharge tie-on fee is hereby made in the amount of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00).

(Ord. 1168)

16-704.      Minimum fee.

Because certain expenses are incurred regardless of usage rate, and certain benefits are derived through the use of said City's wastewater utility regardless of usage rate and because usage rates are, in fact, highly fluctuate, the Governing Body hereby establishes a minimum tie-on fee of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) for each new user inside the City and One thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) for each new user outside the corporate limits of said City.

(Ord. 1168; Code 2011)

16-705.      Conversion of use.

In the event that a user previously connected to the said City's sanitary sewer system, and assessed a fee based on a particular classification, convert the use of said property so as to increase the rate of water usage to an extent whereby the user would be in a classification of higher usage, the City may reclassify the user and assess a new tie-on fee based upon the new classification minus any previous tie-on fees paid. In the event that a user can be reclassified to a classification of lower usage, the City will not reclassify the user but will let the highest rate of usage classification preside. A change in the characteristics of wastewater discharged by the user may be constituted as a change of use. 

(Ord. 530)

16-706.      Strength of waste.

In the event that a user is projected to discharge waste that is described in 16-501, the Governing Body may, upon evaluation of available data and information, assess additional surcharge fees above and beyond any other fees as set forth within these regulations.

(Ord. 530)

16-707.      Special contracts.

Nothing herein shall be construed as to prohibit the Governing Body of said City from entering into special contractual arrangements with new users for the payment of fees in such event that the Governing Body so deem it necessary to do so for the joint benefit of the Wastewater Utility and the community at large. 

(Ord. 530)

16-708.      Payment.

Upon proper application to the Governing Body of the City of Andover, Kansas, payment of the surcharge tie-on fee shall be made at the time of filing of a building permit or other permits of the City. Payment shall be the sole responsibility of the owner of the property connected. 

(Ord. 804)

16-709.      Review of fees.

The City is not obligated to review or adjust the fee of a new user, but will do so upon request of the user if the request is made in accordance with proper administrative procedures. 

(Ord. 530)

16-710.      Billing.

Upon a determination of an assessment for the tie-on fee for a new owner, said owner shall be notified through a bill for the amount of the assessment mailed to the address provided by the new owner. In the event that an assessment has not been made at the time of connection to the sanitary sewer, the owner may pay the minimum fee at the time of connection and the balance upon receipt of the bill after the assessment is made. The owner of the property shall be solely held responsible for the payment of said fees and billings will be made to the owner solely.

(Ord. 530)

16-711.      Penalties.

That following the rendition of bills and statements by the City's Clerk to users of the sanitary sewer system of said City setting out each particular user's connection fee, if such bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days following the date on which the statement was mailed, then such bill shall be considered past due or delinquent, payments shall be re-billed to the user adding thereto a penalty for the increase of connection costs in the amount of 10% of the amount past due for such connection fee but not to exceed $500, which penalty shall be in addition to the interest charge of 5% permitted by Statute, when the same is certified upon the tax rolls. That nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the City of Andover, Kansas, from rendering its statement or statements for the charges made hereunder in conjunction with statement or statements rendered for the solid waste service charges imposed by said City under the terms of different ordinances.

(Ord. 530)

16-712.      Tax liens.

That should any person, firm, organization, political unit, except the United States and the State of Kansas, or organization living or operating on the premises connected to the City sanitation system of the City of Andover, neglect, fail, or refuse to pay the surcharge fixed by this Article or any amendment thereto, such surcharge shall constitute a lien upon the real estate served by the connection to the sewer, and shall be certified by the City Clerk of said City to the County Clerk of Butler County, Kansas, to be placed on the tax rolls for collection subject to the same penalties and collection in like manner as other taxes are by law collected, and such Governing Body is hereby authorized to refuse the delivery of water through the pipes of said utility supplying said City until such time as such charges are fully paid subject, of course, to the provisions for administrative hearing as provided hereinafter in this article. 

(Ord. 530)

16-713.      Water cutoff.

That before the City of Andover, Kansas, shall cause the water connection to any customer in said City to be discontinued by reason of the proper person chargeable for it that the charges herein provided such, person or persons shall be provided by said City written notice of its intention to cause such water connection to be disconnected at least ten (10) days in advance of hearing to be held upon the same before the Governing Body of said City. Such notice shall set out the date, time, and place of such hearing, and at which hearing such person, firm, or corporation shall be allowed to show good cause why such water service should not be disconnected. Nothing herein shall be construed a waiver or estoppel of said City to bring a civil action for the collection of said paid due service charges.

(Ord. 530)

16-714.      Review and change of ordinances.

That nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the review and change of such rates as established herein either upon the initiative of the Governing Body or by request of a sewer user. Any user of the City sewer system liable for a surcharge hereunder shall have the right to file with the Governing Body of said City an application for hearing to be heard by the Governing Body at the next regular meeting of said Governing Body, (excepting, if such regular meeting is within seven (7) days of the filing of such application for hearing, in which event, the hearing shall be held at the next following regular meeting) at which hearing the said applicant may present any and all evidence relating to the need for adjustment of the user's surcharge. In the event of a request for hearing by a user, the City shall mail notice in writing to such user of the date and time of such hearing, said notice to be provided at least seven (7) days in advance of such hearing.

(Ord. 1168)

16-715.      Newly annexed.

For each newly annexed user of City sewer service which has not previously been assessed these surcharges and has not previously paid said surcharges, there shall be assessed surcharges according to 16-702.

(Ord. 530)

16-716.      Use of funds.

Funds received by the said City from the proceeds of such sewer connection surcharges shall be placed in a fund known as “Main Sewer Expansion Fund” and shall be used only for the expansion and upgrading of the main sewer system of said City, or sewer disposal works of said City or any other sanitary sewer improvements, the payment of which would normally be an obligation of the City at Large. At the discretion of the Governing Body, these funds may also be used to retire bond debt resulting solely from sewer expansion as described immediately above.

(Ord. 530)

16-717.      Penalty.

Any person, group of persons or agents, tenants, or any one or more persons occupying lands or representing the owner or occupants of lands upon which, or to which, a sanitary sewer connection has been knowingly made in violation of the terms of this ordinance, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and assessed a penalty of not less than Five Dollars ($5) nor more than One Hundred Dollars ($100) for each day that each violation aforesaid exists.

(Ord. 530, Sec. 1)

ARTICLE 8.   SEWER SERVICE CHARGES

16-801.      Purpose.

There are certain expenditures of the wastewater utility that are attributed to the annual operation and maintenance of the utility. There is, therefore, now established a sewer service charge for sewer service provided by said city's wastewater utility to meet the funding demands of annual operation and maintenance of the utility.

(Ord. 541)

16-802.      Assessment.

There is hereby imposed a sewer service charge upon each separate user of the sanitary sewer system of said city.

(a)   Residential

That for the purpose of establishing just and equitable sewer service charges for the provision of sanitary sewer service by the wastewater utility of said City, the Governing Body hereby establishes that, based upon studies of water usage within said City and other data, it is determined that for each residential unit (for the purpose of this section each separate dwelling unit, even within a common structure, be it a duplex, triplex, fourplex, condominium, apartment, or mobile home shall be considered a separate residential unit with a separate sewer user and will be subject to separate and individual charges) that is connected to the sanitary sewer system of said City shall be assessed a sewer service charge of Seventeen Dollars ($17.00) per month and that such determination is based upon an average residential use of water at the rate of 6,000 gallons/month, which charge and usage shall be referred to as “base charge” and “base usage.”

(b)   Non-Residential

Based upon such base charges and base usages aforesaid, the sewer service charge for other classifications and usages in said City is hereby found and established to be as follows:

(1)   For each manufacturing, industrial, commercial, or multi-use, excepting any category or other such usage provided for hereinafter, the sewer service charge rate shall be the base rate Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per month for each 6,000 gallons of water used on the premises as determined by the records of the Water Department of the City of Wichita and in the office of the City Clerk of Andover, Kansas. That as hereinafter provided, the Governing Body may review such rates from time to time and take into consideration other matters such as quantity of industrial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer, water used and evaporated for cooling purposes, and any and all other factors which may tend to raise or lower the rates charged such classification, and direct the City Clerk to adjust or to change the fee for such user in this classification in accordance with the findings of the Governing Body.

(2)   For each “car-washing” stall establishment, the sum of Seventeen Dollars ($17.00) per month for each car-washing stall established in said business whether inside or outside the City, or Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per 6,000 gallons used on the premises as determined from the records of the City of Wichita, whichever is greater. If no water use data is available, the minimum of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per stall per month shall be charged based upon the belief of the City that the same adequately reflects the proper rate of usage in establishing the sewer service charge rate.

(3)   For each school, whether public or private, the monthly sewer service charge shall be the base rate of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per month for each 6,000 gallons of water used at all school properties determined by the records of the Water Department of the City of Wichita and in the office of the City Clerk of Andover, Kansas.

(c)   Metering

All new users falling within a “b” classification as set forth immediately hereinabove shall be required to meter all water to be discharged to said City's sanitary sewer system and shall be forbidden to discharge any unmetered flows to said City, subject to penalty as prescribed by 16-106. Metering costs shall be borne by the owner. The meter must be available for reading by City personnel.

(d)   Meter Data Interpretation

Water use data shall be obtained for any nonresidential user known, or believed to be using in excess of 12,000 gallons per month. The water use data for the months of May, June, July and August shall be disregarded to exclude summer lawn care and water cooling devices from sewer usage calculation, unless other information warrants the use of that data. The usable data shall then be converted to an average monthly usage rate for user fee assessment for the next year or until a new usage rate is obtained, whichever is the latter.

(Ord. 623; Ord. 865; Code 2011)

16-803.      County surcharge.

For each user of City sewer service outside the City limits of Andover, Kansas, either within the limits of any benefit district for sanitary sewer service or outside a sanitary sewer district, there shall be a charge in addition to the charges for operation and maintenance of an amount equal to 50% of the inside City limit user fee to be used for Capital Debt Retirement.

(Code 2011)

16-804.      Minimum fee.

Because certain expenses are incurred regardless of usage rate, and certain benefits are derived through the use of said City's wastewater utility regardless of usage rate, the Governing Body hereby establishes a minimum sewer service charge of Seventeen Dollars ($17.00) per month for each user inside the City and Twenty-Five Dollars and Fifty Cents ($25.50) per month for each user outside the corporate limits of said City, to be payable regardless of usage rate. In the event of vacation of premises, 50% of this minimum fee may be assessed in place of an occupied fee if, and only if, the owner of said property renders notice of vacation and requests minimum fee implementation in writing to the City Clerk. It shall then be the sole responsibility of the owner of said property to inform the City Clerk when said property is occupied. Upon failure to provide this notification to the City Clerk of such reoccupation, the owner of said property shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and assessed a penalty of not less than Fifty Dollars ($50) nor more than One Hundred Dollars ($100).

(Ord. 865; Code 2011)

16-805.      Conversion of use.

In the event that a user, previously connected to the said City's sanitary sewer system and assessed a service charge based upon a particular classification, converts the use of said property so as to change the water usage rate, or change the characteristics of the wastewater discharged by the user to an extent that could result in the user being reclassified and assessed a different service charge, the said City may reclassify the user and assess a new charge based upon their classification.

(Code 2011)

16-806.      Strength of waste.

In the event that a user is projected to discharge waste that is described in 16-501, the Governing Body may, upon evaluation of available data and information, assess additional service charges above and beyond any other fees as set forth within these regulations.

(Code 2011)

16-807.      Special contracts.

Nothing herein shall be construed as to prohibit the Governing Body of said City from entering into special contractual arrangements with new users for the payment of user fees in such event that the Governing Body so deems it necessary to do so for the joint benefit of the Wastewater Utility and the community at large.

(Code 2011)

16-808.      Payment.

The charges hereinabove established shall be effective on July 1, 1996, and such charges shall be paid to the City of Andover, Kansas, for the use of the sewage disposal system of said City by all persons, firms, corporations, the United States, or the State of Kansas and its political subdivisions, whose premises are connected, or may be hereafter connected, to the said sewage disposal system of said City, either within or without said City. The said sewer service charges hereinabove established shall be made on a monthly basis in arrears of such charges and the use of the sanitary sewer system of said City by any person, firm, corporation or organization hereinabove mentioned for any calendar month, or for any portion of a calendar month, shall entitle the City to said sewer service charges for the full month. The said sewer service charges shall be billed by said City to such persons, firms, corporations and organizations responsible for the payment thereof, whether within or without the corporate limits of said City, on a quarterly basis, that is, for the periods of October through December, January through March, April through June, and July through September of each year. Payment shall be the sole responsibility of the owner of the connected property.

(Ord. 865)

16-809.      Review of fees.

(Code 2011)

16-810.      Billing.

Upon a determination of an assessment for the service charge for a new owner, said owner shall be notified through a bill for the amount of the assessment mailed to the address provided by the new owner. The owner of the property shall be solely held responsible for the payment of such sewer charges, and billings will be made to the owner only.

(Code 2011)

16-811.      Penalties.

(a)   That following the rendition of bills and statements by the City's Clerk to users of the sanitary sewer system of said City setting out each particular user's charge for a monthly or quarterly year period, if such bill remains unpaid for a period of 20 days following the date on which statement was mailed then such bill shall be considered past due or delinquent. Payments shall be rebilled to the user adding thereto a penalty for the increase of collection costs in the amount of 10% of the amount past due for such sanitary sewer service charge, which penalty shall be in addition to the interest charge of 10% per year permitted by statute, when the same is certified upon the tax rolls. That nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the City of Andover, Kansas, from rendering its statement or statements for the charges made hereunder in conjunction with statements or statements rendered or the solid waste service charges imposed by said City under the terms of different ordinances.

(b)   Should the City desire to amend this article by raising the base rate as set out in Chapter 16, Section 801, to change the base rate, said notice to be given by publication of the same in the official City newspaper at least seven (7) in advance of its hearing on the advisability of making such change.

(Code 2011)

16-812.      Tax liens.

That should any person, firm, organization, political unit, except the United States and the State of Kansas, or organization living or operating on the premises connected to the City sanitation system of the City of Andover, neglect, fail, or refuse to pay the sanitation charge fixed by this Article or any amendment thereto, such charges shall constitute a lien upon the real estate served by the connection to the sewer, and shall be certified by the City Clerk of said City to the County Clerk of Butler County, Kansas, to be placed on the tax rolls for collection subject to the same penalties and collection in like manner as other taxes are by law collected, and such Governing Body is hereby authorized to refuse the delivery of water through the pipes of said utility supplying said City until such time as such charges are fully paid, subject, of course, to the provisions for administrative hearing as provided hereinafter in this article.

(Code 2011)

16-813.      Water cutoff.

That before the City of Andover, Kansas, shall cause the water connection to any customer in said City to be discontinued by reason of the proper person chargeable for it that the charges herein provided, such person or persons shall be provided by said City written notice of its intention to cause such water connection to be disconnected at least ten (10) days in advance of hearing to be held upon the same before the Governing Body of said City. Such notice shall set out the date, time, and place of such hearing and at which hearing such person, firm or corporation shall be allowed to show good cause why such water service should not be disconnected. Nothing herein shall be construed a waiver or estoppel of said City to bring a civil action for the collection of said past due service charges.

(Code 2011)

16-814.      Modification of sewer charges:

Should the Governing Body deem it advisable to change, amend, alter, or modify the general nature of sewer charges imposed by the City of Andover, Kansas, all such changes and modifications of the nature of such fees and assessments shall be by subsequent Ordinance.  In the event that the Governing Body deems it advisable to alter the amount of assessment in connection with any such fee or charge already established by Ordinance, the modification of such fee may be by simple Resolution adopted by a majority of the Governing Body which Resolution or Resolutions shall at all times be available for inspection at City Hall. In accordance with the foregoing, any change in the amount of connection fees as established by Section 16-601, inspection fees as established by Section 16-602, surcharges as established by 16-702, tie-on fees as established by Section 16-704 and service charges as established by Sections 16-802 and 16-804 may be made by simple Resolution.

16-815.      Newly annexed.

For each newly annexed user of City sewer service which has not previously been assessed these sewer service charges and has not previously paid said service charges, there shall be assessed sewer service charges according to 16-802.

(Code 2011)

16-816.      Use of funds.

Funds received by said City from the proceeds of such sewer service charges shall be placed in a fund known as the “Sewer Utility Fund” and shall be used only for the funding of the annual operation and maintenance of the utility, the unreserved balance, depreciation reserves, equipment reserves and the payment of annual debt retirement on revenue bonds issued solely for the benefit of the Wastewater Utility.

ARTICLE 1.   STANDARD TRAFFIC ORDINANCE

18-101.      Standard traffic ordinance incorporated.

Pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 12-3009 et seq., and K.S.A. 12-3301 et seq., the Standard Traffic Ordinance for Kansas Cities, 2019 Edition, as prepared and published in book form by the League of Kansas Municipalities, Topeka, Kansas (the “STO”), is hereby adopted by reference, as if said model or standard ordinance were set out in full herein, save and accept such sections, parts, or portions as may be omitted or deleted, modified, or changed elsewhere within the Code of the City of Andover, Kansas.

(Ord. 1473; Ord. 1491; Ord. 1519; Ord. 1552; Ord. 1579; Ord. 1602; Ord. 1627; Ord. 1643; Ord. 1678; Ord. 1730)

18-102.      Deletions.

Subsection 33(a) relating to Maximum Speed Limits is hereby deleted from the STO with substitute provisions having been enacted at Sections 18-201, 18-202, 18-301 and 18-302 of the Code.

(Ord. 1473; Ord. 1491; Ord. 1519; Ord. 1552; Ord. 1579; Ord. 1602; Ord. 1627; Ord. 1643; Ord. 1678; Ord. 1730)

18-103.      Copies.

The City Clerk of Andover, Kansas shall prepare and make three (3) copies of the STO, by marking or stamping thereon “Official Copy as Incorporated by Ordinance No. 1730.  With all sections or portions thereof intended to be omitted clearly marked to show any such omission and to which shall be attached a copy of this article or said ordinance, and filed with the City Clerk to be open to inspections and available to the public at all reasonable business hours.

(Ord. 1473; Ord. 1491; Ord. 1519; Ord. 1552; Ord. 1579; Ord. 1602; Ord. 1627; Ord. 1643; Ord. 1678; Ord. 1730)

18-104.      Repealed.

(Repealed by Ord. 1328)

18-105.      Traffic infractions.

To expedite the handling of traffic offenses considered to be minor enough to be handled without a court appearance the legislature enacted K.S.A. 8-2118 which gives an accused person an opportunity to pay a fixed fine by mail.  These traffic offenses are classified as traffic infractions.  City traffic offenses, which prohibit the same traffic offenses as state traffic infractions must be classified as “ordinance traffic infractions.”  A list of ordinance traffic infractions showing the Standard Traffic Ordinance section and corresponding state statute appears in the Appendix of the Standard Traffic Ordinance.

(Ord. 1172)

ARTICLE 2.   TRAFFIC, IN GENERAL

18-201.      Maximum speed limits, general.

(b)   Whenever the Governing Body shall determine upon the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation, that any maximum speed limit is greater or less than is reasonable or safe under existing conditions upon any part of any street or alley in the City, or such maximum speed limit is otherwise required in accordance with Kansas law, the Governing Body may determine and declare a reasonable and safe maximum speed limit which shall be effective upon the erection of signs giving notice thereof.

(c)   The maximum speed limit shall be effective at all times, or the same may be effective during hours of darkness or at other times as may be determined (if appropriate signs giving notice of such times are erected).

(Ord. 616; Ord. 1251; Ord. 1656)

18-202.      Maximum speed limits.

The provisions of this subsection relating to school buses shall also apply to buses used for the transportation of students enrolled in community colleges or area vocational schools, when such buses are transporting students.

(b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 18-201 (pursuant law pre-dating K.S.A. 8-1560), the speed in residential districts shall not exceed 25 miles per hour, except as otherwise posted (including those designated as school zones).

ARTICLE 9.   JUNKED VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY

18-901.      Findings of governing body.

The governing body finds that junked, wrecked, dismantled, inoperative or abandoned vehicles affect the health, safety and general welfare of citizens of the city because they:

(a)   Serves as a breeding ground for flies, mosquitoes, rats and other insects and rodents;

(b)   Are a danger to persons, particularly children, because of broken glass, sharp metal protrusions, insecure mounting on blocks, jacks or other supports;

(c)   Are a ready source of fire and explosion;

(d)   Encourage pilfering and theft;

(e)   Constitute a blighting influence upon the area in which they are located;

(f)   Constitute a fire hazard because they frequently block access for fire equipment to adjacent buildings and structures.

(Ord. 1394, Sec. 1)

18-902.      Definitions.

As used in this ordinance, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

Any one of the following conditions shall raise the presumption that a vehicle is junked, wrecked or inoperable;

(1)   Absence of a current registration plate upon the vehicle;

(2)   Placement of the vehicle or parts thereof upon jacks, blocks, or other supports;

(3)   Absence of one or more parts of the vehicle necessary for the lawful operation of the vehicle upon street or highway.

(3)   To any person conducting a business enterprise in compliance with existing zoning regulations or who places such vehicles behind screening of sufficient size, strength and density to screen such vehicles from the view of the public and to prohibit ready access to stored vehicles by children.  However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the maintenance of a public nuisance.

(Ord. 1394, Sec. 1)

At the time of the issuance of the building permit the requested development upon each lot will be taken into account and a determination will be made as to whether the actual development will be the same as assumed at the time of the payment of the estimated fee. If so, no additional fee will be imposed. If the usage of the lot as reflected within the building permit application indicates the construction of improvements which will result in a higher fee than represented by the estimated fee, the city's zoning administrator shall collect an additional fee consistent with the actual proposed development of the lot, which additional fee shall be based upon rates prevailing at the time of the payment of the additional fee.

19-509.      Storm Water Discharges from Construction Activities. 

(a)   General requirements (all sites):

(1)   The owners of construction sites shall ensure that best management practices are used to control and reduce the discharge of pollutants into the MS4 and waters of the United States to the maximum extent possible under the circumstances.

(2)   Qualified personnel (provided by the owner of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within twenty-four hours of the end of a storm that produces one-half inch or more of precipitation.  All erosion and sediment control measures and other identified best management practices shall be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the MS4.  Based on the results of the inspection, the best management practices shall be revised as appropriate as soon as practicable.  These inspections, along with a description of revisions, will be documented in writing and available for inspection by the Storm Water Utility Operator upon request.

(3)   Should it be found that soil or pollutants have already or may be carried into the MS4 or waters of the United States, immediate measures will be taken by the owner to remedy the violation and/or remove the pollutant(s).  If the owner fails to remove said pollutants within the time period prescribed in the notice of violation from the city, the city may remove the pollutants and assess the cost thereof to the responsible owner.  Failure by the owner to pay said costs will be grounds for the denial of further approvals or the withholding of occupancy certificates.

(4)   When determined to be necessary for the effective implementation of this section, the Storm Water Utility Operator may require any plans and specifications that are prepared for the construction of site improvements to illustrate and describe the best management practices required by subsection A.1 of this section above that will be implemented at the construction site.  Should the proper BMP’s not be installed or if the BMP’s are ineffective, upon reasonable notice to the owner, the city may deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, subdivision plat, site development plan, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy.

(5)   The owner of a site of construction activity is responsible for compliance with the requirements in this subsection.  In the case of new subdivisions, builders on individual lots can operate under the developers NPDES permit, if the developer’s SWP3 deals with individual lots and the contractor’s certification has been assigned.

(6)   Any contractor on a construction site will also be required to use best management practices so as to minimize pollutants that enter into the MS4.

(7)   All persons shall avoid damaging BMP devices once in place.  Any person damaging a BMP device shall be responsible for the repair of the damaged BMP device.  Malicious destruction of a BMP device or failure of such responsible person to repair BMP device will be deemed a violation of this chapter.

(b)   Sites requiring Federal and/or State NPDES Storm Water Discharge Permits.  All owners of and contractors on sites of construction activity, that require a federal or state NPDES storm water discharge permit, or that are part of a common plan of development or sale requiring said permit(s), shall comply with the following requirements (in addition to those in subsection A):

(1)   Any owner who intends to obtain coverage for storm water discharges from a construction site under the Kansas General Permit for Storm Water Discharges From Construction Sites (“the construction general permit”) shall submit a signed copy of its notice of intent (NOI) to the Storm Water Utility Operator when a building permit application is made.  If the construction activity is already underway upon the effective date of this chapter, the NOI shall be submitted within thirty days.  When ownership of the construction site changes, a revised NOI shall be submitted within fifteen days of the change in ownership.

(2)   A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3) shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the construction general permit or any individual or group NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the construction site, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this chapter and any other city chapter.

(3)   The SWP3 shall be prepared by a qualified person and shall comply with State NPDES requirements.  The signature of the preparer shall constitute his/her attestation that the SWP3 fully complies with the requirements of the permit issued.

(4)   The SWP3 shall be completed prior to the submittal of the NOI to the Storm Water Utility Operator and for new construction, prior to the commencement of construction activities.  The SWP3 shall be updated and modified as appropriate and as required by the NPDES permit.

(5)   The Storm Water Utility Operator may require any owner who is required by subsection B.2 of this section to prepare a SWP3, to submit the SWP3, and any modifications thereto, to the Storm Water Utility Operator for review at any time.

(6)   Upon the Storm Water Utility Operator’s review of the SWP3 and any site inspection that he/she may conduct, if the SWP3 is not being fully implemented, the Storm Water Utility Operator or his/her representative may upon reasonable notice to the owner, deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, site development plan, final occupancy certificate, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction.  A stop work order may also be issued.

(7)   All contractors working on a site subject to an NPDES permit shall sign a copy of the following certification statement before beginning work on the site:  “I certify under penalty of law that I understand the terms and conditions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit that authorizes the storm water discharges associated with construction activity from the construction site identified as part of this certification and with the storm water pollution prevention ordinance of the city, and I agree to implement and follow the provisions of the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) for the construction site.”  The certification must include the name and title of the person providing the signature; the name, address, and telephone number of the contracting firm; the address (or other identifying description) of the site; and the date the certification is made.  All contractors will be responsible for their own activities to ensure that they comply with the owners’ SWP3.  Failure to comply with the SWP3 or malicious destruction of BMP devices is hereby deemed to be a violation of this chapter.

(9)   The Storm Water Utility Operator may notify the owner at any time that the SWP3 does not meet the requirements of the NPDES permit issued or any additional requirements imposed by or under this chapter.  Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or this chapter which are not being met by the SWP3, and identify which provisions of the SWP3 require modification in order to meet such requirements.  Within ten days of such notification from the Storm Water Utility Operator, the owner shall make the required changes to the SWP3 and shall submit to the Storm Water Utility Operator a written certification from the owner that the requested changes have been made.

(10) The owner shall amend the SWP3 whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWP3, or if the SWP3 proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in storm water discharges.

(11) Qualified personnel (provided by the owner of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within twenty-four hours of the end of the storm that produces one-half inch or greater of precipitation.  Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system.  Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall be observed to endure that they are operating correctly.  Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the MS4.  Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking.

(12) Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection B.11 of this section, the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWP3 shall be revised as appropriate.  Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWP3 within ten calendar days following the inspection.

(13) A report summarizing the scope of any inspection required by subsection B.11 of this section, and the name(s) and qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the date(s) of the inspection, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3, and actions taken in accordance with subsection B.12 of this section above shall be made and retained on site as part of the SWP3.  Such report shall identify any incidence of noncompliance.  Where a report does not identify any incidence of noncompliance, the report shall contain a certification that the facility is in compliance with the SWP3, the facility’s NPDES permit, and this chapter.  The report shall be certified and signed by the person responsible for making it.

(14) The owner shall retain copies of any SWP3 and all reports required by this chapter or by the NPDES permit for the site, and records of all data used to complete the NOI for a period of at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized.

(15) Upon final stabilization of the construction site, the owner shall submit written certification to the Storm Water Utility Operator that the site has been finally stabilized.  The city may withhold the final occupancy or use permit for any premises constructed on the site until such certification of final stabilization has been filed and the Storm Water Utility Operator has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has occurred and that any required permanent structural controls have been completed.

Such franchise assessment shall be compatible with Company's billing system. To the extent any transporter using the Company's facilities fails to pay any amounts owed by transporters under the separate ordinance, Company shall notify the City of such amount and City shall be solely responsible for collecting any sums owed.

SECTION 6.

If a telecommunications local exchange service provider offers additional services of a wholly local nature which if in existence on or before July 1, 2002, would have been included with the definition of gross receipts, such services shall be included from the date of the offering of such services in the city.

“Local exchange service” means local switched telecommunications service within any local exchange service area approved by the state corporation commission, regardless of the medium by which the local telecommunications service is provided.

Compensation during the renewal term of the contract franchise ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to the initial term and compensation shall continue to be paid as provided for in this section.

The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to the telecommunications local exchange service provider, no more than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the compensation paid pursuant to this contract franchise ordinance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall in any way obligate AT&T Kansas for the negligence of any other third party or any portion of any harm caused by the same.

The indemnity provided by the subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors.  If AT&T Kansas and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of Kansas without, however, without waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law.  This section is solely for the benefit of the City and AT&T Kansas and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.

1.1 — Developing a Project in Andover 
This Chapter contains information on the process and scheduling requirements for developing a project in the City of Andover. 
1.1.1 — Getting Started 
1.1.2 — Scheduling & Contact Information 
1.1.1 — Getting Started 
Development projects may range in scale from installing a backyard shed to creating a new subdivision. 
If you intend to build a structure on your property, or change the use of land you own, check first to see what steps you . will need to take to meet the City's regulatory requirements. 
There are good reasons for every regulation, which are intended to maintain public safety and protect property values. 
For small projects, a property owner or contractor may only need to deal with City Planning and Zoning staff, to confirm that zoning requirements are being met, and apply for necessary permits and approvals.  
The process for larger development projects is more complex, and often requires public review meetings, as well as approval from the Planning Commission, the Site Plan Review Committee, . and the City Council. 
FIRST STEP 
To develop a project of any size in Andover, first contact the City's Planning and Zoning Department at (316) 733-1303, or at planning&zoning@andoverks.com. Staff there can help you navigate the system, and answer questions. 
Once staff understands the scope of the project, they will be able to provide detailed information on the process to follow, and application forms which specify the information that will need . to be provided to the City.

WHICH REGULATIONS MAY APPLY 
Generally, Zoning Regulations apply to all buildings, structures and land uses inside the city limits. They affect new structures or uses, changes in use, and structures being relocated. Structures and uses must be appropriate for the zone in which they are located. To find out which zone your property is in, look at the interactive Zoning Map on the City's website or contact the Planning and Zoning Department at (316) 733-1303, or at planning&zoning@andoverks.com. 
Subdivision Regulations apply to any landowner who wishes to divide or subdivide land, develop a plat, alter the boundaries of an existing lot or parcel, or vacate a right-of-way, easement, public reserve, or recorded plat. Subdivision Regulations apply both inside the City, and outside the city limits within Andover's extraterritorial jurisdiction. (Map and description of Andover's extraterritorial jurisdiction are available in Subdivision Regulations, Section 1-102.) 
Site Plan Review Procedures & Standards are intended to maintain and enhance the quality of the built environment . in Andover. They apply inside the City, to any parts of a development project which can be seen from public rights-of-way, including exteriors of buildings, accessory structures, signs, parking areas, lighting, and landscaping. They do not apply to single-family or two-family residential projects unless they are . in a group setting (see Zoning Regulations, Section 3-107C). 
The Building & Construction Codes, Stormwater Management . & Riparian Buffer Regulations, and Floodplain Management Regulations address the details of construction, and are generally implemented by professional architects, engineers and contractors who are familiar with their many detailed requirements. 

PROJECT REVIEW & APPROVAL 
If your project is large enough to require public review and approval, it may need to be presented in a specific sequence . to some or all of the following City organizations. 
• 	The Andover City Planning Commission (PC), whose members are appointed by the City Council to 3-year terms.  
Members of the Planning Commission also serve as the City's Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA), making decisions on variances from the terms of the regulations, appeals of Zoning Administrator determinations, and conditional uses. 
Certain members of the Planning Commission also serve on its Subdivision Committee (PCSC), which focuses on the development and redevelopment of subdivisions, and provides recommendations to the Planning Commission as a whole. 
• 	
The Andover Site Plan Review Committee (SPRC), whose members are appointed by the City Council to 3-year terms. SPRC Committee members have backgrounds in such fields as architecture, landscaping, construction, urban planning, historical preservation, traffic control, public safety, . civil engineering, and local business ownership. 

The Site Plan Review Committee reviews all multi-family residential and all nonresidential projects, considering the arrangement of buildings, visual appearance, and safety issues. 

• 	
The City Council (CC) of Andover consists of six elected City Council members. Together with the elected Mayor, they are the Governing Body of the City of Andover. 


Agendas & Minutes: Current Agendas and Minutes from previous meetings of these organizations are available on the City website at www.andoverks.com/122/Agendas-Minutes..

SETTINGS: The blue area  

around the word Dupré,

from ashlar to smooth stone  
in the Andover sign, 
each constitute a setting, 
which must be included 
as part of the  
sign message area. 






The blue metal frame is structural, and so is not considered the boundary of a setting. Therefore, the white background outside of the text and graphic is not included in the  sign message area. 


For a wall sign that is 
painted directly on the wall, 
the entire painted area of the sign 
is considered to be a setting, 
and so is included in the  
sign message area. 


For a wall sign that is 
a panel mounted on the wall,  
the panel itself is the sign structure, 
and so is not considered to be a setting, 
and is not included 
in the sign message area. 


The sign message area 
for a wall sign with  
individual letters or graphics 
mounted on the wall 
is determined with the 
polygon method. 


The sign message area for a window sign is determined with the polygon method. 
This window sign shows text and graphics enclosed in the maximum-allowed 3 polygons. The largest polygon has the maximum-allowed 12 sides.  
The paw prints are the company logo, and therefore are included the sign message area. 
The checkerboard pattern is considered . a window display decoration, and therefore. is excluded from the sign message area. 
Photographs or drawings 
included in a window sign, 
even as background, 
are considered to be graphics, 
and so must be included in the  
sign message area.

ARTICLE 9.  NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES & USES 
100 Nonconformities 
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to provide for regulation of nonconforming lots, buildings, structures and uses, and to specify circumstances and conditions for their continuation. 
1. Nonconforming signs are addressed in Zoning Regulations, Section 8-103C. 
B. Definitions.
 1. 
NONCONFORMITY: A nonconforming lot, structure, or use that does not comply with current regulations, but that complied with the zoning regulations in effect at the time it was legally established.

 2. 
NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD: A zoning lot which does not comply now with lot area, width or depth requirements for any permitted use in its zoning district, but which has a recorded plat or deed showing that it was owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when its size and dimensions were not prohibited by any Zoning Regulations.

 3. 
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE: An existing building or structure which does not comply with requirements (such as maximum lot coverage, maximum height, or minimum yard) applicable to new structures in its zoning district.

 4. 
NONCONFORMING USE: An existing use of a structure or land which does not comply with use regulations applicable to new uses in its zoning district. 


C. Rights. A lawfully established nonconformity is a vested right protected by due process, which is sometimes referred to as being "grandfathered-in". 
1. 
To be lawfully established, a nonconformity must exist before the regulations restricting its establishment are enacted. A nonconformity which violated Zoning Regulations at its inception has no lawful right to continue. 

2. 
By right, a legally established nonconformity may be sold, inherited, transferred or assigned, unless the ownership or operator is a condition attached to a special or conditional use approval.

 3. 
Certain limitations, as provided in this Article 9, may be placed on the expansion, repair, maintenance and continuance of nonconformities. 



D. Determination of Nonconformities. The Zoning Administrator determines the nonconforming status of a lot, use or structure.

1. 
The Zoning Administrator will establish a process for 
registering and keeping records of nonconformities. 


2. 
There is no deadline for registration. However, property owners are encouraged to register nonconformities at their earliest convenience.

a. 
Current and proposed zoning district classifications. 

b. 
The Applicant's reasons for seeking reclassification.

 (1) Factors which must be addressed are derived. from the Supreme Court of Kansas decision. in the Golden v. City of Overland Park case. [224 Kan. 591 P. 2d 130 (1978)].. 


 2. Factors Addressed in Zoning Administrator Report.. Before the Planning Commission evaluates a zoning district reclassification, the Zoning Administrator will provide a preparatory report for their review, addressing the following factors: 
a. 
Does adequate public infrastructure (including water, sewer, and street access) exist or could it be provided, in order to serve permitted uses under the changed zoning classification? 

b. 
If the zoning change request was approved, would the subject property need to be platted or re-platted, or have in-lieu-of dedications made, in order to provide needed rights-of-way, easements, building setback lines, or access control? 

c. 
If the zoning change request was approved, would the subject property need a screening plan for existing or potential uses? 

 d. 
What fact-based information in support of or in opposition to the requested zoning change has staff received?

 e. 
If there has been an error in the application of these Zoning Regulations to the subject property, would the requested zoning change correct the error?


 3. Factors for Planning Commission Consideration.. When the Planning Commission evaluates a zoning district reclassification, they must consider the factors addressed in the Zoning Administrator's preparatory report, as well as the following factors:
 a. 
How suitable or unsuitable is the subject property for its current zoning? 

b. 
Is the length of time the subject property has been vacant or undeveloped under its current zoning a factor in the zoning change request? 

c. 
How reasonably well-suited will the requested zoning change of the subject property be with the current zoning of nearby properties? 

d. 
Has the zoning change been requested because conditions in the area of the subject property have changed or are changing? If so, what is the nature and significance of these conditions?

 e. 
What are the current land uses, character and condition of the subject property and the surrounding neighborhood? 

f. 
Would the proposed zoning change of the subject property allow land uses which might have detrimental effects on nearby properties, and if so, how? 

g. 
How would this requested zoning change conform with the City's Comprehensive Plan and other adopted master plans and policies? 

h. 
Do any professional persons knowledgeable on conditions that affect this zoning change request have information or recommendations to provide, which would be helpful in its evaluation? 

 i. 
How would the potential loss in value or hardship imposed on the Applicant compare to the relative gain to the public health, safety, and welfare, if there is a change from the current zone to the requested zone? 




H. Zoning Classification of Lesser Change. The Planning Commission may recommend changing the zoning of only a portion of a subject property, or giving all or any part of the property a zoning classification of lesser change than that described in the notice, without republication of a notice or redistribution of notices to property owners.

a. 
The Applicant at the Governing Body meeting at which a zoning amendment is being considered wants to amend the application.

a. 
Another time period is designated, as a condition attached to the special use. 

b.

v. City of Overland Park case [224 Kan. 591 P. 2d 130 (1978)]. 


 2. Factors Addressed in Zoning Administrator Report:. Before the Planning Commission evaluates a special use application, the Zoning Administrator will provide a preparatory report for their review, addressing the following factors: 
a. 
Does adequate public infrastructure (including water, sewer, and street access) exist or could it be provided, in order to serve the special use? 

 b. 
If the special use request was approved, would the subject property need to be platted or re-platted, or have in-lieu-of dedications made, in order to provide needed rights-of-way, easements, building setback lines, or access control? 

 c. 
If the special use request was approved, would the subject property need a screening plan for existing or potential uses? 

 d. 
What fact-based information in support of or in opposition to the requested special use has staff received?

 e. 
If there has been an error in the application of these Zoning Regulations to the subject property, would the requested special use correct the error?



 3. Factors for Planning Commission Consideration. . When the Planning Commission evaluates a special use application, the factors addressed in the Zoning Administrator's preparatory report as well as the following factors may be used as guidelines for reaching a recommendation.
 a. 
How suitable or unsuitable is the subject property for its current use? 

b. 
Is the length of time the subject property has been vacant or undeveloped under its current zoning a factor in the special use request?


 c. 
How reasonably well-suited will the requested special use of the subject property be with the current zoning of nearby properties?

 d. 
Has the special use been requested because conditions in the area of the subject property have changed or are changing? If so, what is the nature and significance of these conditions? 

 e. 
What are the current land uses, character and condition of the subject property and the surrounding neighborhood?

 f. 
Would the proposed special use of the subject property allow land uses which might have detrimental effects on nearby properties, and if so, how? 

g. 
How would this requested special use conform with the City's Comprehensive Plan and other adopted master plans and policies? 

h. 
Do any professional persons knowledgeable on conditions that affect this special use request have information or recommendations to provide, which would be helpful in its evaluation? 

 i. 
How would the potential loss in value or hardship 
imposed on the Applicant compare to the relative gain 
to the public health, safety, and welfare, if there is a 
change from the current use to the requested special 
use?

3.1.2 — Intent 
A. Andover citizens have expressed a clear desire to maintain. and enhance the quality of the built environment in their community. In 1997 the Andover City Council established a. site plan approval process to ensure quality development,. and to increase public participation in the design and physical development of the community.  
The Site Plan Review Standards in Chapter 3.4 are intended to 
establish appearance standards for development projects that 
will enhance the overall attractiveness of the community. 
Standards apply to those parts of a project which can be seen 
from public rights-of-way, including exteriors of buildings, 
accessory structures, signs, parking areas, lighting, and 
landscaping. 
When properly implemented, Site Plan Review Standards 
improve the livability of neighborhoods, enhance the 
appearance of commercial areas, increase property values, 
improve relationships between non-compatible land uses, 
screen undesirable views, and contribute to a positive image 
for the community.. 
3.1.3 — Authority and Applicability 
A. Authority for the Site Plan Review and Approval process may be found in the Zoning Regulations, Section 3-107, including information on Site Plan Review Committee membership and procedures, and site plan review applicability, inspections, assurances, appeals, enforcement, and fees.  
 1. In the MXN zoning district, Site Plan Review Standards . will be applied to projects on a case by case basis.

3.2.2 — Procedures Overview 
There are eight steps in the Site Plan Review and Approval process. 
A. Step 1:  Obtain Information.  Potential developers obtain information from the Andover Zoning Administrator on the site plan approval process, including Site Plan Review procedures and Review Standards. 
B. Step 2:  Select Review Options.
 1. Zoning Administrator Approval or Committee Approval Option. Applicant may choose to seek Site Plan approval by the Zoning Administrator, rather than the SPRC. This option is intended to expedite the process for projects that are very small in scale, or which involve improvements determined largely by zoning requirements. 
a. The Zoning Administrator Approval option is allowed solely at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator.

 2. One-stage or Two-stage Review Process. Applicant may choose a One-stage Review Process, and submit only a . Final Application, or may choose a Two-stage Review Process, and submit a Preliminary Application followed by . a Final Application. 
 a. The Two-stage Review Process option is intended to allow the Applicant to discuss broad design concepts with the SPRC early in the process, to make sure they are acceptable before proceeding with detailed project design. 

C. Step 3:  Prepare Application.  Applicant prepares Site Plan Approval application documents, meeting the application requirements described in Chapter 3.3, and meeting the requirements of the Site Plan Review Standards described in Chapter 3.4. 
Foster Design Associates LLC Main TOC Site Plan Review TOC page 3 of 51 
D. Step 4:  Technical Review.  Applicant submits Site Plan Approval application documents to Zoning Administrator for technical review, to confirm that they are complete and meet approved procedures for application.

a. If in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator the application contains errors or is incomplete, the application will be returned to the Applicant for required changes. Application must be corrected and resubmitted at least 10 days prior to the SPRC meeting at which it is scheduled for review, or be rescheduled for a later SPRC meeting. 

E. Step 5:  Submit Application for Final Review.  Once an application has successfully completed technical review,. the Zoning Administrator will schedule it for final review. 
1. 
For applications undergoing Zoning Administrator Review, technical review will be followed by final review.

 b. 	
Zoning Administrator prepares a report on the results of the initial technical review of the application drawings, and provides copies of the application and the report to all SPRC members. 




F. 	Step 6:  The SPRC Meeting Agenda is advertised in the official city newspaper, so the public is aware of pending site plan applications to be reviewed. 
G. Step 7:  SPRC meets to consider Site Plan Approval applications.

 2. Final Review and Approval or Disapproval. The SPRC considers the Final Application for approval or disapproval, with or without conditions, based on the Site Plan Review Standards in Chapter 3.4. 
a. 
The SPRC may choose to hear comments from the Applicant and the public, however the review process is not a public hearing, and they are not required to do so. 

b. 
The SPRC may allow exceptions to the strict provisions of the Review Standards when extraordinary conditions exist which the Review Standards do not address. Any such exceptions must maintain the purposes and intent of the Standards. 

c. 
At least 4 members of the SPRC must be present to consider an application for approval or disapproval. 


 (1) Approval or disapproval is decided by an affirmative vote of the majority of the members present. 

Foster Design Associates LLC Main TOC Site Plan Review TOC 	
page 4 of 51 
 (2) A minimum of 3 affirmative votes are required for approval or disapproval. 
 d. The Applicant may request a continuance of the. Final Review to the following SPRC meeting,. but may not request an indefinite deferral.

A. Calculating Required Landscape Area. Use this table to calculate the minimum amount of Landscape Area required for Street Yards, in all zoning districts. . 
(See definitions of LOT DEPTH and STREET FRONTAGE.) 
Lot Depth  Lot Depth Factor  
175 feet or less  10 feet  
175.01 to 275 feet  12 feet  
275.01 to 375 feet  15 feet  
more than 375 feet  20 feet  

1. On a zoning lot with street frontage on one public street,. find the property's lot depth in the table, then multiply. the associated lot depth factor (LDF) by the lot's street frontage (SF) in feet, to calculate the minimum required landscape area (RLA) in square feet.  
LDF x SF = RLA 

2. On a zoning lot with street frontage on 2 or more public streets, each of which requires a landscaped street yard, take the sum of the street frontages (SFS), and subtract the greatest perpendicular (GP) distance between the property line abutting a street and a major STREET WALL LINE. Multiply this number by the lot depth factor (LDF) (in the above table) associated with the property's average lot depth. (See definitions of LOT DEPTH and AVERAGE LOT DEPTH.) The result is the minimum required landscape area (RLA) in square feet.  
(SFS – GP) x LDF = RLA 

Foster Design Associates LLC Main TOC Site Plan Review TOC page 22 of 51 
 a. 
OPTION: 	Calculate each frontage on a multiple-frontage lot separately, and add the required landscape areas together. If this total is smaller than the results from the average lot depth calculation, the smaller of the 2 required landscape area calculations may be used.  

(1) For long narrow zoning lots, calculating each frontage separately generally results in a smaller required landscape area. For zoning lots with frontages of similar length, the average lot depth calculation generally results in a smaller required landscape area. 

b. 
On multiple-frontage zoning lots, the required area of landscaped street yard does not have to be equally distributed to the various street frontages.


 (1) Each street yard should have a minimum of 20% of the total required landscaping. 
EXAMPLE LANDSCAPE AREA CALCULATION  for Street Yard in Multiple Frontage Lot — 
SUM OF THE STREET FRONTAGES: 
Frontage A (200') + Frontage B (120')=320', 
SUBTRACT THE GREATEST PERPENDICULAR: 

minus Perpendicular B (50') =270'; 
AVERAGE LOT DEPTH: (202'+98')/2=150'; THE FACTOR IN THE TABLE FOR 150' LOT DEPTH IS 10'; 
MINIMUM REQUIRED LANDSCAPE AREA: 270'x 10' = 2700 square feet 
distributed with at least 20% (2700 x 0.20 = 540 SF) in each of the 2 street yards.

B. Landscape Area Requirements.
 1. 
The intent of landscape areas in street yards is to provide shade, visually soften the masses of buildings, screen parking areas, and produce a pleasing appearance. 

2. 
Bring soil surface at the sidewalk or back of curb in street yard landscape areas to a smooth finished grade.

 3. 
Decorative paved surfaces (such as brick or concrete pavers, stamped concrete or colored concrete) within a street yard landscape area may be credited to a maximum of 45% of street yard landscape area. 


a. Non-decorative paving, such as asphalt or standard exterior concrete slab, does not count as landscape area. 

C. Required Trees and Plants: Calculate 3 shade trees for every 1000 square feet of required street yard landscape area, and round up to the nearest whole number of trees.
 1. 
Ornamental trees may be substituted for required shade trees, at the rate of 2 ornamental trees for 1 required shade tree. 

2. 
Shrubs may be substituted for up to 1/3 of the required trees, at the rate of 10 shrubs for 1 required shade tree or 5 shrubs for 1 ornamental tree. 

a. 
Substitute shrubs must be at least 2 feet in height. at maturity. 

b. 
Shrubs required for parking lot screening may not be counted as substitute shrubs for required shade trees. 



 3. 
Required trees may be clustered rather than spaced evenly. Maintain adequate distance between individual trees as follows:

 a. 
Shade trees — minimum 25 feet apart.  

 b. 
Ornamental trees — minimum 15 feet apart.  




. 


Foster Design Associates LLC Main TOC Site Plan Review TOC page 24 of 51 
 4. Locate trees in planter areas of sufficient size to accommodate the growth of the trees, and designed to prevent damage to the trees by vehicles.
 a. A minimum of 25 square feet of permeable ground surface area per tree is recommended. 

 5. Do not locate required trees or shrubs in adjacent public rights-of-way, unless no conflicts exist with utilities, and plant locations are approved by the Zoning Administrator.
 a. Under no circumstances can conifer trees be located in public rights-of-way. 

D. Visibility Standards for Landscaped Street Yards.
 1. Within a street intersection's Vision Triangle, locate and maintain shrubs, walls and fences at a maximum of 33 inches in height. (See definition of VISION TRIANGLE.)
 3. Vehicle Access Vision Triangles are located along driveways on private property, at the property line adjacent to a street or alley. Within a vehicle access vision triangle, shrubs, walls and fences which are 25% or more opaque in design must extend no more than 3 feet above finish grade. (See definition of VEHICLE ACCESS VISION TRIANGLE.) 
3.4.8 — Landscaping in Buffers between Land Uses 
A. Any nonresidential project, manufactured home park, . or multi-family project (a project with 3 or more dwelling units in one building) which is adjacent to a residential zoning district, is required to have a landscape area along the common property line to provide a visual buffer. 
1. 
Screening is intended to reduce visual, acoustic, and olfactory effects, including lighting glare, equipment noise, and blowing trash.

 2. 
Any such project which is across the street from a residential zoning district is required to have a landscape buffer area along the front lot line at least 10 feet in depth. 

a. No other uses except driveways and signs are allowed in this landscape buffer area. 


3. 
Where SF or ISB type landscape buffers (See 3.4.8 B 3 and 4) are required between land uses, the height and intensity of required screening may be reduced in the front yard area, from the building wall line out to the right-of-way line. 

4. 
An additional landscape buffer along the common property line is not required where a development site abuts a public park or other permanent public greenspace, and where at least 100 feet of undisturbed natural vegetation which meets landscape buffer requirements exists along the common lot line. 


B. Buffers Between Zoning Districts. Where adjacent land uses are in different zoning districts, use the Table of Required Landscape Buffers in 3.4.8 B5 to determine the minimum landscape buffer required along the common property line between zoning districts.
 1. NR = No requirement for screening and buffering. 
Foster Design Associates LLC Main TOC Site Plan Review TOC page 25 of 51 
 2. LB = Landscape buffer required. Use planting materials, berms, walls, or fences to provide a minimum of. 3 vertical feet of screening, measured from the adjacent ground surface. 
a. 
Maximum side slope for berms is 3 horizontal. 
to 1 vertical, and berm tops should not be level,. 
but rather should be shaped to look like natural 
landforms. 


 b. 
NUMBER OF TREES REQUIRED (LB). In addition to the required 3 vertical feet of screening, at least 1 shade tree per 40 linear feet or 1 ornamental tree per 30 linear feet of buffer length is required in the screening plan. Required trees may be grouped or clustered. 

c. 
If walls and fences are used for required screening,. the requirement for trees in the landscape buffer. still applies. 



 3. SF = Screening fence or wall required.  Provide a minimum of 6 vertical feet of solid fence or wall, measured from the adjacent ground surface.
 a. NUMBER OF TREES REQUIRED (SF).  In addition to the required fence or wall, at least 1 shade tree per 40 linear feet or 1 ornamental tree per 30 linear feet of buffer length is required in the screening plan. Required trees may be grouped or clustered. 
(1) If traffic circulation, loading/unloading facilities, outdoor storage, etc. occur between the adjacent zoning districts, provide a minimum 20-foot wide landscape area along the common property line, and provide at least 2 shade trees per 40 linear feet or 2 ornamental trees per 30 linear feet of buffer length.

 4. ISB = Intense screening buffer required. Provide the same screening as required by the SF requirements above, and in addition, separate nonresidential and residential buildings by at least 100 horizontal feet. .

C. The SPRC may, at its discretion, temporarily or permanently waive the requirements for a landscape buffer between land uses if one of the following circumstances applies:
 1. 
The adjacent residential land use may not need or benefit from such a landscape buffer.

 2. 
The adjacent land use already has an adequate landscape buffer. 

 3.

Andover Floodplain Management Ordinance
ARTICLE 1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS
OF FACT, AND PURPOSES
Section A. Statutory Authorization
1. Approval of Draft Ordinance by Kansas Chief Engineer Prior
to Adoption
The following floodplain management regulations,
as written, were approved in draft form by the
Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources
of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on
/ JivOxAer '2.^ . 20/£.
2. Kansas Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A.
12-741 etseq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental
units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare. Therefore, the City of Andover, Kansas,
ordains as follows:
Section B. Findings of Fact
1. Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation
The special flood hazard areas of Andover, Kansas,
are subject to inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base; all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
2. General Causes of the Flood Losses
These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative
effect of development in any delineated floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
(2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages.
3. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards
The Flood Insurance Study (PIS) that is the basis of
this ordinance uses a standard engineering method
of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series
of interrelated steps.
a. Selection of a base flood that is based upon
engineering calculations, which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its
expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base
flood selected for this ordinance is representative
of large floods, which are characteristic of what
can be expected to occur on the particular
streams subject to this ordinance. The base flood
is the flood that is estimated to have a one
percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any one year as delineated on the Federal
Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative
materials dated June 2, 2009 as amended, and
any future revisions thereto.
Article 1: Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, and Purposes
1-1
Andover Floodplain Management Ordinance
b. Calculation of water surface profiles that are
based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel
and overbank areas to convey the regulatory
flood.
c. Computation of a floodway required to convey
this flood without Increasing flood heights more
than one (1) foot at any point,
d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines
within which no development Is permitted that
would cause any Increase In flood height.
e. Delineation of floodway fringe, I.e., that area
outside the floodway encroachment lines, but
still subject to Inundation by the base flood.
Section C. Statement of Purpose
It Is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses
described In Article 1, Section B(1); to establish or maintain
the community's eligibility for participation In the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined In 44 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the
requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying
the provisions of this ordinance to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, or property In times of flooding or cause undue
Increases In flood heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods. Including public
facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood
protection at the time of Initial construction; and
3. Protect Individuals from buying lands that are unsulted for
the Intended development purposes due to the flood
hazard.

1-2
Andover Floodplain Management Ordinance
ARTICLE 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section A. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies
This ordinance must apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of
the City of Andover, Kansas, identified as numbered and
unnumbered A Zones, AE, AO, and AH Zones, on the Index Map
dated June 2, 2009 of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as
amended and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered
by this ordinance, no development must be permitted except
through the issuance of a floodplain development permit,
granted by the Governing Body of the City of Andover or its
duly designated representative under such safeguards and
restrictions as the Governing Body or the designated
representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and
maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants
of the community, and as specifically noted in Article 4.
Section B. Compliance
No development located within the special flood hazard areas
of this community must be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
Section C. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this ordinance must prevail. All other
ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Section D. Interpretation
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
ordinance must be held to be minimum requirements, must be
liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and must
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers
granted by Kansas statutes.
Section E. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased
by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This ordinance does not imply
that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damage. This ordinance must not create a liability on the part
of the City of Andover, any officer or employee thereof, for
any flood damages that may result from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
Section P. Severability
If any section; clause; provision; or portion of this ordinance is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate
jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance must not be
affected thereby.

the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential
projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The community must select and adopt a regulatory
floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for
the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the
waters of the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at
any point.
2. The community must prohibit any encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,
and other development v/ithin the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood
levels within the community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
3. If Article 4, Section E(2), is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial-improvements must comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4.
4. In unnumbered A zones, the community must obtain,
review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or
floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or
other sources as set forth in Article 4, Section A(2).

floodway if any increase in flood discharge would result.
4. Variances must only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.
5. Variances must only be issued upon:
(a) showing of good and sufficient cause,
(b) determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and
(c) determination that the granting of a variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
