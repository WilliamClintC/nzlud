SUPPLEMENTATION 
The City of Fort Lupton, Colorado Municipal Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained. 
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement number, date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last . 
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed under the Supplementation tab, behind this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included. 
The maintenance of a Municipal Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the legislative ordinances of the municipality.

PREFACE 
The City of Fort Lupton, a statutory city, has published its Municipal Code in a format which features the following: 
The Table of Contents is the table containing each chapter and article title, with reference to page location. Preceding each chapter is a chapter table of contents, also identifying each article by the subject name provided. 
The two-place section numbering system places the chapter number first, followed by a hyphen and section number. This two-place system is simplified by the elimination of article numbering. Each section may be cited by the chapter and section numbers which, together with reserved section numbers, are in sequence within each chapter. 
The open chapter and page numbering system creates reserved chapter and page numbers for expansion or revision of the code without undue complication when changes are made to the code by supplementation. 
The Disposition of Ordinances Table identifies the source for the contents of the code. This table provides ordinance numbers in chronological order and location by section number for the present code contents. Thus, if there is interest in determining whether an ordinance, or a portion thereof, is contained within the code, the Disposition of Ordinances Table will provide that information. The Table of Up-to-Date Pages lists all of the current pages through the most recent supplementation. 
The Index provides references by common and legal terminology to the appropriate code sections. Cross references are provided with the Index when appropriate. 
Supplements to the code provide regular updating of the code to maintain it as a current compilation of all the legislation which has general and continuing effect. Without regular supplementation, the code would soon lose its usefulness as a complete source of the general law of the municipality. Supplementation is accomplished by the periodic publication of additions and amendments to the code.

Sec. 2-156. - Assessment of court costs, jury fees and collection costs. 
    The Municipal Judge is empowered to assess court costs of up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) against any defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, or is found guilty at the time of sentencing or at the time of entry of judgment and penalty. Total court costs may exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), if the total is more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as a result of witness fees assessed, jury fees assessed or assessments pursuant to Section 2-155. Convicted defendants are to be assessed witness fees of five dollars ($5.00) for each witness subpoenaed and appearing for the City in a jury trial case. Jury fees shall be ten dollars ($10.00) per day for persons appearing pursuant to being summoned and fifteen dollars ($15.00) per day for persons serving on the jury. Total costs may also exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) as a result of warrant issuance fees imposed or an outstanding judgment warrant cost (OJW) or default warrant cost (DW), and collection fees for cases that are referred to a private collection agency. Entry of an order to pay a fine, penalty or assessment, and court costs, also constitutes a civil judgment against a defendant. If all or a part of such are not paid when due, one (1) of the City's options is to collect the amount due as a civil judgment, including referral to a collection agent or agency. Collection costs shall be due to the City from the defendant, and the original amount ordered and due shall be increased to include interest from the date ordered due at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, court costs incurred in the collection process, attorney fees incurred in the collection process and the fee or charge for collection by the agent or agency.

(a)  Whenever a minor under the age of eighteen (18) years residing with his or her parent/legal guardian is convicted of a violation of a municipal ordinance or code section, or found liable for a traffic infraction for which the Municipal Court imposes a fine, a penalty or court fees or costs, the parent/legal guardian of the minor may be jointly responsible for payment of such fine, penalty or court costs, by court order. It shall be an affirmative defense to the obligation created by this Section if the parent/legal guardian demonstrates to the Municipal Court that, at the time of the violation, either: 
(1)  The parent/legal guardian did not have lawful custody of the minor; or 
(2)  The minor is emancipated. For purposes of this Section only, the term emancipated minor means a minor over fifteen (15) years and under eighteen (18) years of age who has, with real or apparent assent of his or her parents/legal guardians, demonstrated his or her independence from his or her parents/legal guardians in matters of care, custody and earnings. The term may include but shall not be limited to any such minor who has the sole responsibility for his or her own support, who is married or who is in the military. 
(b)  Parents/legal guardians are ordered by the Municipal Court to attend the first appearance in Municipal Court with their children who are alleged to have committed a violation. At that time or, if they do not appear at that time, at a later time when they do appear, the Municipal Court shall make the parent/legal guardian parties to the action and advise them of their responsibility under this Section. It is at that time that the parent/legal guardian must raise any affirmative defense, unless the Municipal Court grants permission for them to demonstrate their affirmative defense at a later hearing.

If the parties cannot agree on a final settlement amount, the parties shall submit the dispute to a mutually agreed upon mediator within sixty (60) days of reaching an impasse.

Nothing in this provision shall be construed to limit the Franchising Authority's authority to enter into other cable franchises that the Franchising Authority, in its sole discretion, determines meet the cable related needs and interests of the Franchising Authority. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, at any time that a nonwireless facilities-based entity, legally authorized by state or federal law, makes available for purchase by subscribers or Customers, Cable Services or multiple channels of video programming within the Franchise Area without a franchise or other similar lawful authorization granted by the Franchising Authority, then the Grantee may seek modification as per Subsection (a) above, or the term of the Grantee's Franchise shall, upon ninety (90) days written notice from the Grantee, be shortened so that the Franchise shall be deemed to expire on a date thirty-six (36) months from the first day of the month following the date of the Grantee's notice.

(a)  Franchise fee. In partial consideration for the Franchise, which provides the certain terms related to the Company's use of City streets, public utility easements and other City property, which are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the City at great expense to its residents, and in recognition of the fact that the grant to the Company of the Franchise is a valuable right, the Company shall pay the City a sum equal to three percent (3%) of all gross revenues. To the extent required by law, the Company shall collect this fee from a surcharge upon City residents who are customers of the Company. 
(b)  Obligation in lieu of fee. In the event that the franchise fee specified herein is declared void for any reason by a Court of competent jurisdiction, unless prohibited by law, the Company shall be obligated to pay the City, at the same times and in the same manner as provided in the Franchise, an aggregate amount equal to the amount that the Company would have paid as a franchise fee as partial consideration for use of the City streets, public utility easements and other City property.

(c)  Changes in utility service industries. The City and the Company recognize that utility service industries are the subject of restructuring initiatives by legislative and regulatory authorities, and are also experiencing other changes as a result of mergers, acquisitions and reorganizations. Some of such initiatives and changes have or may have an adverse impact upon the franchise fee revenues provided for herein. In recognition of the length of the term of this Franchise, the Company agrees that, in the event of any such initiatives or changes and to the extent permitted by law, upon receiving a written request from the City, the Company will cooperate with and assist the City in modifying this Franchise in an effort to provide that the City receives an amount in franchise fees or some other form of compensation that is the same amount of franchise fees paid to the City as of the date that such initiatives and changes adversely impact franchise fee revenues. 
(d)  Utility service provided to the City. No franchise fee shall be charged to the City for utility service provided directly or indirectly to the City for its own consumption, including street lighting service and traffic signal lighting service, unless otherwise directed by the City.

(b)  Correction of franchise fee payments. In the event that either the City or the Company discovers that there has been an error in the calculation of the franchise fee payment to the City, either party shall provide written notice of the error to the other party. Subject to the following sentence, if the party receiving written notice of the error does not agree with the written notice of error, that party may challenge the written notice of error pursuant to Subsection (d) below; otherwise, the error shall be corrected in the next monthly payment. However, if the error results in an overpayment of the franchise fee to the City, and said overpayment is in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), at the Company's election, credit for the overpayment shall be spread over the same period the error was undiscovered or the City shall make a refund payment to the Company. All franchise fee underpayments shall be corrected in the next monthly payment, together with interest computed at the rate set by the PUC for customer security deposits held by the Company, from the date when due until the date paid. Subject to the terms of the tariff, in no event shall either party be required to fund or refund any overpayment or underpayment made as a result of a Company error which occurred more than five (5) years prior to the discovery of the error. 
(c)  Audit of franchise fee payments. 
(1)  Every three (3) years, commencing at the end of the third year of this Franchise, the Company shall conduct an internal audit to investigate and determine the correctness of the franchise fee paid to the City. Such audit shall be limited to the previous three (3) calendar years. The Company shall provide a written report to the City Clerk containing the audit findings. 
(2)  If the City disagrees with the results of the audit and if the parties are not able to informally resolve their differences, the City may conduct its own audit at its own expense, and the Company shall cooperate, including but not necessarily limited to, providing the City's auditor with all information reasonably necessary to complete the audit. 
(3)  If the results of a City audit conducted pursuant to Paragraph (2) above concludes that the Company has underpaid the City by five percent (5%) or more, in addition to the obligation to pay such amounts to the City, the Company shall also pay all reasonable costs of the City's audit.

United Power shall be entitled to an extension of time to complete each undergrounding project where United Power's performance was delayed due to a cause that could not be reasonably anticipated by United Power or is beyond its reasonable control, after exercise of best efforts to perform, including but not limited to fire, strike, war, riots, acts of governmental authority, acts of God, forces of nature, judicial action, unavailability or shortages of materials or equipment and failures or delays in delivery of materials. Upon request of United Power, the City may also grant United Power reasonable extensions of time for good cause shown and the City shall not unreasonably withhold any such extension. 
(3)  City revision of supporting documentation. Any revision by the City of supporting documentation provided to United Power that causes United Power to substantially redesign and/or change its plans regarding an undergrounding project shall be deemed good cause for a reasonable extension of time to complete the undergrounding project under this Franchise.

If the total actual cost is materially (i.e. more than ten percent [10%]) different than the cost estimate provided, United Power shall provide a reasonably detailed explanation of the difference. This explanation shall be provided with the detail of the total actual cost. The parties shall then meet within ten (10) business days of United Power providing such detail. The purpose of the meeting shall be to reconcile and agree on a process of crediting or debiting the account, if even necessary, so payment can be made or processed. 
(7)  Audit of underground projects. The City may require that United Power undertake an independent audit of any undergrounding project for five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) or greater. The cost of any such independent audit shall reduce the amount of the Underground Fund. United Power shall cooperate fully with any audit, and the independent auditor shall prepare and provide to the City and United Power a final audit report showing the actual costs associated with completion of the project. If a project audit is required by the City, only those actual project costs, including reasonable internal costs and overhead as charged to the project by United Power's normal cost accounting rules and protocols, confirmed and verified by the independent auditor as commercially reasonable and commercially necessary to complete the project shall be charged to the Underground Fund.

The independent auditor shall provide a written report containing its findings to the City and United Power. United Power shall reconcile the Underground Fund consistent with the findings contained in the independent auditor's written report.

(a)  Energy efficiency programs. 
(1)  General. The City and United Power recognize and agree that energy conservation and efficiency programs offer opportunities for the efficient use of energy and reduction of customers' energy consumption and costs. United Power recognizes and shares the City's desire to advance the implementation of cost-effective energy conservation and efficiency programs, that direct opportunities to United Power's customers to manage more efficiently their use of energy and, thereby, create the opportunity to reduce their energy consumption, costs and impact on the environment. United Power shall seek to develop and offer energy efficiency programs to its customers. United Power commits to offer Demand Side Management (DSM) programs and similar succeeding programs, which provide customers the opportunity to reduce their energy usage. In doing so, United Power recognizes the importance of: (i) implementing cost-effective programs, the benefits of which could otherwise be lost if not pursued in a timely fashion; and (ii) developing cost-effective energy management programs for the various classes of United Power's customers.

United Power shall advise the City and United Power's customers of the availability of assistance that United Power makes available for investments in energy conservation, and may do so through dissemination of such information through its district representatives, newsletters, newspaper advertisements, bill inserts and energy efficiency workshops and by maintaining information of these programs on United Power's website. 
(2)  City improvements. United Power agrees to work with the City to implement periodic grant or other financial assistance programs or mechanisms to assist the City in defraying costs incurred by the City in making technology changes and/or modifications to City facilities or purchasing equipment to provide energy efficiencies and/or conservation. Such grant or other programs or mechanisms may include the provision of matching funds for external grant programs and/or other agreements to utilize accrued but unspent undergrounding funds, provided that such programs or mechanisms do not affect materially United Power's current budget year. A mutually cooperative process, including discussion during the August to September time frame for each ensuing budget year to include such expenditures in the next annual budget cycle, will materially assist the parties in best utilizing such grant or other financial assistance programs. Both parties must agree on the program uses, terms, conditions and funding mechanisms for all such grant or other financial assistance programs before United Power will advance any funds for such program. 
(b)  Renewable resource programs. United Power agrees to invest in clean, renewable electric power and include renewable resource programs as an integral part of United Power's provision of electric service to its customers.

United Power shall obtain an appraisal by a qualified appraiser on any such real property, and the City shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of the qualified appraisal in which to exercise the right of first purchase at the appraised value by giving written notice to United Power. If the City is not satisfied with the appraisal tendered by United Power, the City may obtain, within thirty (30) days of United Power's tender of its appraisal, and at the City's cost, a second appraisal which, upon receipt, shall be tendered to United Power. If United Power is satisfied with the City's appraisal, then, upon notice, the City shall purchase the property at the price set forth in the second appraisal. If United Power is not satisfied with the second appraisal, then the appraisers issuing the first and second appraisals shall choose a third appraiser who will also appraise the property.

The subject matter of the ordinance relates primarily to enforcing an undesirable plant management plan. The purpose of the adoption of this Weld County Ordinance by reference is to provide a consistent approach to managing undesirable plants with Weld County. Three (3) copies of Ordinance 169 adopted herein are now filed with the office of the City Clerk and may be inspected during regular business hours.

    The said adoptive ordinance is subject to the following additions or modifications: 
(1)  Whenever in Ordinance 169 the language specifically limits itself to application by Weld County, that language shall be considered to include application to and by the City of Fort Lupton. For instance, Article II on Page 2 of Ordinance 169 states "description of the County weed problem." Also, paragraph A states "weed species in Weld County to be controlled pursuant to weed control laws." These type of references will be considered to state "City of Fort Lupton" instead of "County" or "Weld County." 
(2)  Article V on liability shall state "this Ordinance 169 or the adoptive ordinance shall not be intended to create a civil cause of action against the Board of County Commissioners of Weld County, Colorado or the City of Fort Lupton, or any other person or entity that may administer the provisions of this undesirable plant management ordinance." (Ord. 99-747) 
Sec. 7-204. - Inconsistent provisions. 
    If inconsistencies exist between the provisions of Ordinance 169 adopted herein and other provisions of this Code, the more restrictive or protective provision shall prevail. For instance, if there are more prohibited weeds in Ordinance 169 than in other provisions of this Code, the weeds prohibited in other provisions and the weeds in Ordinance 169 shall also be prohibited. The provisions of Ordinance 169 and other provisions elsewhere in this Code shall be read together to provide the most comprehensive plan for managing undesirable plants for the benefit of the City and its citizens. 
(Ord. 99-747) 
Sec. 7-205. - Penalties.

ARTICLE X - Pit Bull Regulation 

Sec. 7-241. - Pit bulls prohibited. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to own, keep, possess, maintain or harbor any pit bull or transport pit bulls through the City, except as provided in this Article. 
(Ord. 2003-810 §1; Ord. 2004-828, Pt. 1) 
Sec. 7-242. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this Article, the following words shall have the meanings ascribed hereafter: 
    Pit bull is defined as any dog that is an American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier or any dog displaying the majority of the physical traits of any one (1) or more of the above breeds, or any dog exhibiting those distinguishing characteristics which substantially conform to the standards established by the American Kennel Club for any of the above breeds. Any Colorado licensed veterinarian may attest to whether or not any dog meets this definition. 
    Secure temporary enclosure is a secure enclosure used for the purposes of transporting or holding a pit bull and which includes a top and bottom permanently attached to the sides except for a door for removal of the pit bull. Such enclosure must be of such a material, and such door closed and secured in such a manner, that the pit bull cannot exit the enclosure on its own. 
(Ord. 2003-810 §1; Ord. 2004-828, Pt. 1) 
Sec. 7-243. - Exceptions. 
(a)  The prohibition in Section 7-241 shall not apply in the following enumerated circumstances in paragraphs (1) through (4), which shall be affirmative defenses to any prosecution under this Article. Failure of the owner to comply and remain in compliance with all of the terms of any applicable exception shall subject the pit bull to immediate impoundment and disposal pursuant to Subsection (e) of this Section and shall operate to prevent the owner from asserting such exception as a defense in any prosecution. 
(1)  The owner of a pit bull, who has applied for and received a pit bull license from the City for such pit bull, in accordance with Subsection (d) of this Section and all other applicable requirements of this Chapter, may keep the licensed pit bull within the City. The license will replace the regular dog license required elsewhere in this Chapter. 
(2)  Any licensed veterinarian and any licensed animal shelter may temporarily harbor and transport any pit bull for purposes of temporary shelter and/or treatment and enforcing the provisions of this Chapter. 
(3)  Any such veterinarian or shelter may temporarily hold any pit bull that it has received or otherwise recovered, but only for so long as it takes to conduct treatment or placement back to a licensed owner within the City or placement with an owner outside the City, or receive permission from the owner or the City to destroy or have destroyed the pit bull pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (e). 
(4)  A person without a City pit bull license may temporarily transport a pit bull through the City for treatment at a licensed veterinarian or directly through the City to a location outside the City if the pit bull is confined in a secure temporary enclosure as defined in Section 7-242. 
(b)  The owner of any previously licensed pit bull shall be allowed to keep such pit bull within the City as long as the owner applies for and receives an annual pit bull license for each calendar year. As a condition of renewal of a pit bull license, the owner shall at the time of application comply with or otherwise provide sufficient evidence that the owner is in compliance with all of the following regulations: 
(1)  The owner of the pit bull shall provide proof of rabies vaccination and shall pay the annual pit bull license fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). The fee shall not be reduced for a license lasting less than one (1) calendar year. 
(2)  The owner of the pit bull shall keep current the license for such pit bull through annual renewal by January 15 of each year. Such license is not transferable and shall be renewable only by the holder of the license or by a member of the immediate family of such licensee who is at least twenty-one (21) years of age at renewal. A pit bull license tag will be issued to the owner at the time of issuance of the license. Such license tag shall be attached to the pit bull by means of a collar or harness and shall not be attached to any pit bull other than the pit bull for which the license was issued. If the pit bull tag is lost or destroyed, a duplicate tag may be issued upon the payment of a five-dollar fee. 
(3)  The owner must be at least twenty-one (21) years of age as of January 1, 2003. 
(4)  The owner shall present to the City proof that the owner has procured liability insurance in the amount of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), covering any damage or injury which may be caused by the pit bull during the period covered by the pit bull license. The policy shall contain a provision requiring the insurance company to provide written notice to the City Administrator not less than fifteen (15) days prior to any cancellation, termination or expiration of the policy. 
(5)  The City shall maintain a file containing the identification method and names of licensed pit bulls and the names and addresses of the owners. The owner shall notify the City of any changes of address. 
(6)  At all times when a pit bull is at the property of the owner, the owner shall keep the pit bull confined on the owner's property, and in such a way as to prevent the dog from engaging in conduct described as an animal which creates a danger in Section 7-131. At all times when a pit bull is away from the property of the owner, the owner has the responsibility to see that the pit bull is either securely leashed and muzzled or in a secure temporary enclosure, as that term is defined in Section 7-242. Failure to prevent a licensed pit bull from leaving the owner's property leashed and muzzled or so contained, or engaging in dog fighting, or training for fighting purposes shall cause the license to be revoked, and the owner shall be so notified in writing. The owner shall not sell or otherwise transfer the pit bull to any person except a member of the owner's immediate family (over twenty-one [21] years of age) who will then become the owner and will be subject to all of the provisions of this Chapter. The owner shall notify the City within five (5) days in the event that the pit bull is lost, stolen, dies or has a litter. In the event of a litter, the owner must deliver the puppies to the City for destruction or permanently remove the puppies from the City and provide sufficient evidence of such removal by the time the puppies are weaned, but in no event shall the owner be allowed to keep in the City a pit bull puppy born after the effective date of the ordinance codified herein, that is more than sixteen (16) weeks old. Any pit bull puppies kept contrary to the provisions of this Section are subject to immediate impoundment and disposal. 
(7)  The owner shall have posted at each possible entrance to the owner's property where the pit bull is kept a conspicuous and clearly legible pit bull sign. Such pit bull sign must be at least eight (8) inches in rectangular dimensions and shall contain only the words "PIT BULL DOG" in lettering not less than two (2) inches in height. 
(8)  This Section is designed to allow existing owners of licensed pit bulls to keep them as long as they are promptly licensed and to prevent new pit bulls from being kept within the City. No new licenses will be issued more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of this Section. Existing owners may not replace existing pit bulls which are no longer in their possession. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, the City is authorized to immediately impound any pit bull found in the City which does not fall within the exceptions listed above and the City may house or dispose of such pit bull in such manner as the City may deem appropriate, except as the procedures in Subsection (d) below otherwise require, without compensation to the owner. 
(d)  When the City has impounded any pit bull dog pursuant to Section (c), it shall notify (verbally, in writing or both) the owner, if known, and if the owner of such dog disputes the classification of such dog as a pit bull or claims to have a license, the owner of such dog may file a written petition with the City Administrator for a hearing concerning such no later than three (3) regular business days after impoundment. Such petition shall include the name and address, including mailing address, of the petitioner. The City Administrator will then issue a notice of hearing date by mailing a copy to the petitioner's address no later than five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing. Where no written request from the owner for a hearing is received by the City Administrator within three (3) regular business days of impoundment, the pit bull shall be destroyed with no compensation to the owner. The hearing, if any, will be held before the City Administrator or an officer designated by the City Administrator. Any facts which the petitioner wishes to be considered shall be submitted under oath or affirmation either in writing or orally at the hearing. The City Administrator or hearing officer shall make a final determination whether the dog is a pit bull properly licensed as defined above. Such determination shall be considered a final order of the City Administrator subject to prompt judicial review/appeal by the Municipal Court Judge. The review shall be limited to whether or not the dog is a pit bull properly licensed or not. The Municipal Court shall have the authority to conduct such a review, and to issue orders regarding how the dog is to be kept and by whom during the review process. The appellant must file for this review within three (3) calendar days of the City Administrator's determination. The Municipal Court shall complete its review within thirty (30) days of the City Administrator's finding. If the dog is found to be a pit bull, it shall be euthanized (after the three-day waiting period to allow for a request for review to be filed, unless the owner waives a review), unless the owner produces evidence deemed sufficient by the City Administrator that the pit bull is to be permanently taken out of the City and the owner pays the cost of impoundment. If the dog is found not to be a pit bull, the dog shall be released to the owner. The procedures in this Subsection shall not apply and the owner is not entitled to such a hearing with respect to any dog which was impounded as the immediate result of conduct defined in Section 7-153. In those instances, the dog shall be handled and the procedures governed by the provisions of this Chapter.

ARTICLE III - Parking Regulations 

Sec. 8-51. - Zones for parking. 
    Upon the recommendation of the Chief of Police, the City Council may by resolution create places or zones in the streets or avenues where motor cars may be parked. Such places or zones shall be properly designated, and the Chief of Police shall prescribe proper rules governing the method of parking within same, the time during which zones may be used and the method of driving in and out of such zones, and shall fix such other rules and regulations concerning same as he or she deems desirable. Such rules and regulations shall be subject to the approval, by resolution, of the City Council. 
(Prior code 10-204-115) 
Sec. 8-52. - Unlawful parking. 
(a)  No person or entity shall park or cause to be parked any prohibited truck or trailer outside of an enclosed structure in any residential area. This prohibition is necessary to be consistent with and support residential zoning uses and restrictions, and to promote compatibility of adjacent uses. 
(b)  Parking on public or private property in residential areas is reserved for customary and ordinary residential uses as defined in the zoning part of this code. While commercial or large trucks are allowed to stop for deliveries and services in residential areas to be of use to residents and businesses there, these vehicles, due to size, weight, noise and visual differences, cannot be parked unattended or stored there. It is the intent of this Section to prevent the use of residential areas as substitute or auxiliary commercial parking areas. Because of their common and mixed uses, the parking of pickup trucks is allowed, even though they may be marked with business signs and carry business equipment. Thus, as used in this Section 8-52, a prohibited truck or trailer, except as provided in Subsection (d) herein, shall mean any commercial truck, road truck tractor, semi-trailer, tractor-trailer, commercial trailer or any vehicle having more than two (2) axles, but truck does not mean pickup truck, whether or not marked or used as commercial vehicles. Trucks with mounted booms, and tow trucks, whether or not they have been pickup trucks modified to these uses, are commercial vehicles. This does not include trucks with mounted booms that are public utility trucks, such as United Power, Xcel Energy, Comcast Cable and City of Fort Lupton utility trucks. This exclusion does not exempt such vehicles from the parking regulations found in the Model Traffic Code. Vehicles parked in violation of this Section on public property are subject to towing by the City at the owner's expense without further notice, after a one-time warning, and towed vehicles shall have a lien upon them for storage and towing charges and shall be held until paid, or sold if charges are not paid within thirty (30) days. 
    EXCEPTION: Truck and trailer parking is not allowed along or on private property adjacent to South Grand Avenue (unless temporarily for deliveries to businesses there), and not on vacant lots merely for the purpose of temporary or permanent storage. Truck and trailer parking is allowed in industrial and in commercial areas incidental to a permitted and existing use. 
(c)  As used herein, the term residential shall include any area where residences, such as apartments or single- or multiple-family dwellings, occupy the majority of the property abutting or adjacent to any roadway, alley or street. 
(d)  No person shall park or cause to be parked any motor home, personal trailer, camper trailer, camper, boat or boat trailer on any street or alley within the City longer than temporarily while being prepared for use or being cleaned up from use away from the premises. Such temporary placement may last up to forty-eight (48) hours, but trying to avoid the intent of this Section by moving the unit a short distance or driving it around the block does not start a new forty-eight-hour period. The City Council may establish, by resolution, permits and fees to allow limited occasional temporary parking of recreational vehicles on residential streets and alleys. It is the intent of this Section to prohibit the use of the public streets and alleys for storage of these units, and doing so is unlawful. Vehicles parked in violation of this Section shall be subject to towing, after a one-time only warning, by the City without notice at the expense of the owner; and vehicles towed shall have a lien upon them by the City or by the tow company for towing and storage charges and shall be held until paid, or sold if charges are not paid within thirty (30) days. 
(e)  As used herein, the words park or parked shall mean the standing of a vehicle, whether occupied or not, whether running or not, otherwise than very briefly for the purpose of and while actually engaged in loading or unloading property or passengers.

(Prior code 10-204-116) 
Sec. 8-54. - Parking vehicles for sale upon street. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to park upon a street any vehicle for sale or that is offered or displayed for sale, except that an owner of a vehicle may have one (1) "for sale" sign in one (1) or two (2) windows of one (1) of their vehicles in the driveway of their residence or, if there is no driveway, in one (1) vehicle of theirs on the street directly in front of their residence; provided, however, that such vehicle may not be a derelict vehicle as prohibited in Section 7-36(h) of this Code.

If water shares are to be tendered, they must meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Said water rights or shares will be of an amount to meet the annual water requirement of all the development or annexation as measured by the number and size of water meters. Raw water requirements per meter will be based on the schedule referenced in Subsection (d) below. 
(2)  In the event that the land to be annexed has no water rights or shares or has an amount of water rights or shares that is not sufficient to meet the requirement, an additional water dedication shall be made to the City to satisfy the requirements of this Section. 
(3)  The City Administrator shall determine a cash-in-lieu-of-water fee on a quarterly basis, or as needed, based upon the then-current market price for Colorado-Big Thompson (CBT) water shares. This will be done by contacting water brokers, water consultants and those with knowledge of current water prices. This cash-in-lieu-of-water fee will be used as the basis for assessing water dedications required for new water taps. 
(4)  The Utility Committee and the Planning Commission shall make recommendations to the City Council in all annexation proceedings on matters appropriate to their jurisdictions, specifically in the matters of the landowner's membership in the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District and how the membership relates to the foregoing water requirement in this Section. 
(5)  The cash-in-lieu-of-water fee will be paid in full or water rights will be conveyed to the City prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(b)  A customer request for an increase in water meter size will be granted upon payment of the difference in the cash-in-lieu-of-water fee for the meter size requested and the meter size existing at the time of the request. 
(c)  No refund shall be made to any customer for a decrease in size of water meter or abandonment of water service. In addition, water dedications shall remain with a tap and will not be decreased or transferred for any reason. 
(d)  The water dedication requirements schedule shall be established, and amended from time to time, by resolution of the Fort Lupton Utility Enterprise Board, to meet the needs of the City. 
(e)  The cash-in-lieu-of-water fee requirements may be suspended or modified, from time to time, by resolution of the Fort Lupton Utility Enterprise Board, to meet the needs of the City.

Mere irrigation of the property does not constitute such use. If these three (3) criteria are met, the water dedication requirement shall be adjusted to be a cash-in-lieu fee paid by the applicant to the City equal to the difference between the base water share cost of eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) as of February 28, 2002, and the market rate as of the time of the building permit, if the cost of water shares exceeds eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) at that time. If it does not, there shall be no dedication fee. Failure to begin water service and develop the subject property as specified in the building permit within one (1) year of its issuance shall cause the water tap to be declared inactive and void. In such a case, the water tap fee and cash-in-lieu fee shall be returned to the applicant. None of the building permit fee shall be refunded. Water service shall not thereafter be provided to the property unless available from the City and an applicant meets all standard requirements then in effect when water service may later be requested.

Sec. 13-125. - Inside City water line modifications. 
    The City recognizes its responsibilities as related to water service to existing, developed, platted property within the City which is already served by water mains and fire hydrants which may be inadequate for conformance with sound engineering and public safety standards. When necessity arises for enlarging, replacing or otherwise upgrading the water distribution system in an existing, platted, developed area already served by the City water, the improvements will be made by the City. If such improvements are made necessary by the development of a new subdivision which is to be served by a water main passing through an area described above, then the City will require the developer to negotiate a participation agreement with the City for the cost of the improvements.

All extensions shall conform to City specifications. 
(b)  For subdivisions inside or outside the City limits, the City's main extension policy shall be as follows: 
(1)  The City will extend or require the subdivider to extend the required water main to the subdivision to be served. If the subdivider is required to extend the main, then the City will negotiate a repayment agreement with the subdivider which will allow said subdivider to recoup as much of the cost of the extension between the boundary of his or her subdivision and the nearest properly sized City water main as can be agreed upon. It shall be the City's policy that the subdivider shall pay for the extensions of any water line for his or her subdivision. 
(2)  In the event no agreement can be made between the City and the subdivider, then the City shall not be responsible to extend the main. 
(Prior code 12-405-9; Ord. 99-739) 
Sec. 13-131. - Water and sewer billing and collection.

Sec. 13-143. - Procedure for suspension of water and/or sewer service. 
(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13-131 herein, water or sewer utility service may be suspended for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  Noncompliance with any rule, regulation or ordinance with respect to the municipal water and sewer system; 
(2)  Performance of any act prohibited in this Section; 
(3)  Failure to pay proper water or sewer rates, fees, tolls or charges, or other water or sewer assessments when due; or 
(4)  Noncompliance with the terms of a permit for water or sewer service. 
(b)  Written notice of a proposed suspension of service shall be mailed to the last known address of the customer as shown on City records, and a notice shall also be mailed to the owner or occupant at the address for the property to which service is being supplied or at which premises the cause for suspension arose, if the premises address differs from the address to which billings are sent. Said notice shall include the following: 
(1)  Notification that water and/or sewer service will be suspended on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no sooner than ten (10) working days after the date of mailing of the notice;

(4)  The City telephone number to be called to request a hearing. 
(c)  Upon request of the owner or occupant received within the five-day period above specified, a hearing will be immediately scheduled with the City Administrator. If no hearing is requested or payment of delinquent charges has not been made, or if the City Administrator finds that other reasonable cause still exists for suspension prior to 12:00 p.m. on the date specified in the notice, water or sewer service, as the case may be, shall be suspended and shall not be reinstated until the cause for suspension has been cured. Prior to reinstatement of service to the premises, all charges due, including disconnection and reinstatement charges referred to in this Article, shall be paid. 
(d)  Appeals. Any appeal from the decision of the City Administrator with respect to suspension of service shall be submitted in writing to the Fort Lupton Utility Enterprise Board within twenty (20) working days from the date of the City Administrator's decision. Such an appeal shall set forth with particularity the grounds therefor. Notwithstanding such appeal, service shall be or remain suspended unless the appeal is accompanied by: 
(1)  A payment of the amount in dispute; or 
(2)  An amount determined as being sufficient to insure continued compliance with all applicable ordinances, rules and regulations, which amount shall be specified in the City Administrator's decision. 
(e)  The Fort Lupton Utility Enterprise Board shall review the proceedings before the City Administrator and, within twenty (20) working days after receipt of the appeal, shall enter the Board's written ruling based thereon, a copy of which ruling shall be sent by certified mail to the owner or occupant. In the event the decision is adverse to the owner or occupant, all administrative recourse in connection with the suspension of service shall be deemed to have been exhausted, and the owner or occupant may thereupon pursue such further remedy as the owner or occupant may choose. 
(Prior code 12-430-22; Ord. 645 §1, 1993; Ord. 96-698 §4; Ord. 99-739) 
Sec. 13-144. - Customer complaint procedures.

(Prior code 12-430-23; Ord. 645 §1, 1993; Ord. 96-698; Ord. 99-739) 
Sec. 13-145. - Water leaks. 
    Inasmuch as it is to the benefit of the entire community to conserve water, a property owner who provides proof that they fixed a water leak on their property in a prompt and timely manner may receive a credit adjustment on their next utility bill consistent with regulations under Section 13-135. It is the intent of this policy that the City will share in the cost of the excess water in order to encourage the property owner to fix any water leaks in a timely fashion. 
(Ord. 99-739) 
Sec. 13-146. - Inactivation and termination of water and sewer services. 
(a)  An account will be considered active if the water curb stop is turned on by the City. An account will be considered inactive if the curb stop is turned off by the City for any reason. 
(b)  Upon request by the customer, the City will temporarily disconnect the premises from water service. A fifteen-dollar reconnect fee will be charged upon reconnection. The monthly base service charge for both water and sewer shall continue to accrue during the period of temporary disconnection. 
(c)  Water and sewer services may be inactivated for a period not exceeding five (5) consecutive years by the City upon written request of the owner, provided that the property is not occupied and all outstanding water and sewer fees have been paid at the time the tap is requested to be inactivated. During inactivation, there will be no water flow to the property for any purpose, nor any discharge to the sewer. If the property owner, at any time during the five-year inactive period, desires to reactivate the water and sewer tap, he or she must pay any base fees that accrued during said period before the City will allow the account to be reactivated. Property owners with active water and sewer services who abandon their property without properly requesting to inactivate their account will continue to accrue base fees until the City suspends water and sewer service pursuant to Section 13-143. 
(d)  The City may terminate water and sewer services and disconnect the water and sewer tap connections to any structure where the owner evidences in writing an intent to abandon the service connection. Selling the property to another is not sufficient intent for abandonment. Prior to a determination by the City that a water or sewer service connection is abandoned by the owner, the owner shall be provided a hearing with the City Administrator, at the owner's request. The City Administrator may determine, based upon the evidence present at such hearing, that a water or sewer tap should not be terminated, upon payment by the property owner of any fee, charge or cost identified below. 
(e)  Unless there is a separate, prior written agreement, any application for an enlargement, change in use classification or reactivation of an inactive connection pursuant to Subsection (d) above shall constitute a new connection, and all applicable water rights and requirements fees, water or sewer tap fees and charges associated with the then-current City ordinances shall fully apply. For platted lots as of January 1, 1997, any person or entity not having established water service for any such lot prior to February 28, 2002, and not having a prior written agreement to do so, shall dedicate water shares as provided herein unless, by December 31, 2002: (1) preparation for water service has been made (i.e., tap fee purchased, water meter purchased); (2) the minimum monthly service fee begins to be and continues to be paid; and (3) by February 28, 2004, a building permit is applied and paid for to develop the property for industrial, commercial or residential use. Mere irrigation of the property does not constitute such use. If these three (3) criteria are met, the water dedication requirement shall be adjusted to be a cash-in-lieu fee paid by the applicant to the City equal to the difference between the base water share cost of eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) as of February 28, 2002, and the market rate as of the time of the building permit, if the cost of water shares exceeds eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) at that time. If it does not, there shall be no dedication fee. Failure to begin water service and develop the subject property as specified in the building permit within one (1) year of its issuance shall cause the water tap to be declared inactive and void. In such a case, the water tap fee and cash-in-lieu fee shall be returned to the applicant. None of the building permit fee shall be refunded. Water service shall not thereafter be provided to the property unless available from the City and an applicant meets all standard requirements then in effect when water service may later be requested. 
(Ord. 99-739; Ord. 2001-778; Ord. 2002-798) 
Sec. 13-147. - Additional charges. 
(a)  There shall be charged and added to the water and sewer utility bill a fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) each time a municipal water user or his or her agent requests that the City turn on and restore municipal water service that has been turned off at the request of or by the water user or his or her agent. Said fee shall be charged at the time the water service is turned on and shall be added to the user's water bill. During the period that a municipal water user's service is turned off, said municipal water user shall be responsible for the payment of the monthly base service charge for water and sewer service, including irrigation meters. 
(b)  Water service may be discontinued upon request by the owner, lessee or user of water. The City may require an affidavit signed by the owner, lessee or user prior to shut-off. The affidavit shall include the service address, reason for the shut-off request and whether the property is owner occupied, tenant occupied or vacant. Water shall not be discontinued if the reason for the requested shut-off is related to a landlord-tenant dispute. If the shut-off is granted, there shall be a fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) to restore the water service. 
(c)  Every time a water service employee takes a reading of the meter, other than the normal monthly reading, there shall be a charge of fifteen dollars ($15.00). 
(d)  If a customer requests a meter check, high consumption check, leak check or reports a frozen meter yoke, the customer will not be charged for the first service call in a calendar year. The customer will be charged fifteen dollars ($15.00), on the water bill, each time thereafter. 
(e)  An emergency turn-off due to a water leak in the service line will not be charged a turn-off fee, but the customer will be charged a fifteen-dollar turn-on fee, on the utility bill, if the City turns on the water. 
(f)  Users of water from a designated City fire hydrant shall be assessed a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) permit fee which shall be valid for a period of one (1) year. The permit shall list the party taking the water, the main place of business address and the purpose for taking the water and specific location of hydrant used. The user shall also be required to pay for water taken at the current water rate. In the event any quantity charges remain unpaid sixty (60) days after the completion of the project, the user shall not be permitted to use Fort Lupton municipal water again until all outstanding amounts have been paid, and all remedies available at law shall be pursued to collect the unpaid water taken. All users of water from fire hydrants shall apply for a hydrant meter from the City and supply their own backflow prevention equipment, or may use a water meter provided by the City after payment of a one thousand five hundred dollar ($1,500.00) deposit. Any costs for damage to the water meter will be deducted from the deposit. 
(g)  There shall be no charge for unmetered standby fire protection service to the Fort Lupton Fire Protection District, but the Fire Department shall report the quantity used to the Finance Department on a monthly basis. 
(h)  Users of water for new construction shall be assessed a twenty-five-dollar fee, per month, to cover costs of water used during the time of construction, excluding the use of water for seeding or sodding a lawn. This policy authorizes use of water only for the building for which the permit is issued. Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged and collected at the time a building permit is issued. The charge shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month thereafter, with no proration of days, until the water meter is installed and turned on. The remaining amounts due shall be paid prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. A water meter shall be installed prior to outside seeding or sodding to measure and bill the owner for the actual water usage.

In order to provide flexibility, to provide a means for setting performance standards for individual land uses and to help diversify uses within a zoning district, specified uses are permitted in certain districts subject to the granting of a special use permit. The list of permitted uses in each zone district is exclusive, meaning that uses not specifically described are not permitted, but similar uses and compatible uses, may be permitted as special uses as set forth in this Section. Because of their unusual or special characteristics, special uses require review and evaluation so that they may be located properly with respect to their effects on surrounding properties. The review process prescribed in this Section is intended to assure compatibility and harmonious development between special uses, surrounding properties and the City at large. Special uses may be permitted subject to such conditions and limitations as the City may prescribe to ensure that the location and operation of the special uses will comply with special use criteria. Special uses are granted to individuals or entities and not to the property itself. Special uses lapse as a matter of law, without hearing or notice, upon cessation of the specific granted use for a period exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days. The scope and elements of any special use may be limited or qualified by the conditions applicable to the specific property. Where conditions cannot be devised to achieve these objectives, applications for special use permits shall be denied.

Sec. 16-12. - Appeals.

(2)  Any applicant deciding to appeal any City action must file with the Planning Department a written notice of appeal on forms provided by the City and the required application fees within ten (10) days following the action appealed from, specifying: 
a.  The action taken by the City and the date taken; 
b.  The grounds for appeal; and 
c.  The relief requested. 
The scope of the appeal shall be limited to those specifications. 
(3)  Following receipt of a notice of appeal, the Planning Department shall then notify the Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment, the City Attorney and the staff person involved and provide each with a copy of the notice of appeal. The City Attorney may reject the appeal as to form if it does not contain the three (3) required categories of information set forth in Paragraph (2) above. The applicant shall have an additional five (5) days to file an amended notice of appeal. The application fee is not refundable for rejection as to form. 
(4)  Hearing and jurisdiction. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give due notice thereof to the parties and decide the same within a reasonable time. The Board shall not consider matters beyond its jurisdiction or not within its authority, and the City Attorney may render a legal determination on such matters before or during the hearing. Hearings shall be open to the public. Upon any hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The applicant shall be provided the opportunity to present any evidence, documentation or argument in support of his or her position raised in the notice of appeal and may be questioned by the applicant, members of the Board, the City Attorney or administrative staff. The City may present any evidence, documentation or argument in support of the City's position and may be questioned by the applicant, members of the Board or the City Attorney. Testimonial evidence need not be under oath, but may be if the Board so requires. The Board shall make its findings and conclusions on the record. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, within the scope of the notice of appeal, and to that end has all the power of the administrative staff member from whom the appeal is taken. The Board may consider an applicant's unique hardship, as long as the applicant did not create his or her own hardship. 
Buying property without knowledge of facts that are available about the property does not create a hardship. Failing to verify or misinterpretation by the applicant of any City code does not create a hardship. Convenience or profit alone shall not constitute undue hardship. 
(5)  The Board has no authority to create a use that does not exist under the Zoning Code or allow what is specifically prohibited in this Code or those codes adopted by reference. 
(6)  No single decision of the Board sets a precedent. The decision of the Board shall be made on the particular facts of each case.

c.  The positive or negative impact of the requested appeal on the achievement of stated City development goals and objectives; and

(e)  Variance criteria. 
(1)  The Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance to the Code, which: 
a.  Permits a land use not allowed in the zoning district in which the property is located; 
b.  Is in the public right-of-way or on public property; 
c.  Alters any definition of the Code; 
d.  Is other than the minimum variance that will afford relief with the least modification possible to the requirements of the Code; 
e.  Is based on physical conditions or circumstances of the property so general or recurring in nature as to reasonably make practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the Code; 
f.  Is based exclusively on findings of personal or financial hardship. The Board may consider the hardship the applicant may suffer, as long as the applicant did not create his or her own hardship. Buying property without being aware of available facts about the property does not create a hardship. Failing to verify or misinterpretation by the applicant of any City code does not create a hardship. Convenience, profit or caprice shall not constitute undue hardship; or 
g.  Will result in the extension of a nonconforming situation, use, building or lot; authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use of land or conflict with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  In order to grant a variance to the Code, the Board of Adjustment shall find that all the following have been satisfied: 
a.  That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions of the land such as irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of the lot, or exceptional topographical or other physical condition of the land particular to the affected property; 
b.  That, because of these unique physical circumstances or conditions, the property cannot be reasonably developed or used in compliance with the provisions of the Code; 
c.  That such unique physical circumstances or conditions are unique and unusual or nearly so, rather than shared by many surrounding properties; 
d.  That, due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions of the land, the strict application of the Code would create a demonstrated hardship; 
e.  That the demonstrable hardship is not self-imposed; 
f.  That the hardship or poor land use of which the applicant complains is one suffered by the applicant alone and not by neighbors or the general public; 
g.  That the variance, if granted, will not adversely affect the proposed development or use of adjacent property or the neighborhood; 
h.  That the variance, if granted, will not change the character of the zoning district in which the property is located; 
i.  That the variance, if granted, is in keeping with the intent of the Code; 
j.  That the variance, if granted in a floodplain or floodway, meets the requirements of floodplains and floodways of this Code and any other applicable law; 
k.  That the variance, if granted, will not adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the City; and 
l.  That the variance requested is the minimum necessary to provide relief. 
(f)  Operation and monitoring. The City may establish and carry out procedures as are reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the conditions of approval of the variance. Failure of a landowner to comply with the conditions of a variance shall constitute a violation. 
(Ord. 2006-869 Pt. 1; Ord. 2015-994 §62) 
Sec. 16-14. - Minor administrative variations. 
    The Planning Director, after consulting with the Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment and the City Attorney, shall have the authority to approve variations from the zoning regulations of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the required standards in cases of demonstrated hardship. If any of the three (3) do not agree that the proposed variation is justified, such variation will require application for a variance and review by the Board of Adjustment by the process for variances provided by this Code. No more than one (1) such variation may be granted to the same standard on any property. Written notice of any administrative variation shall be provided to the owner of the property and a copy kept on file with the City.

(a)  For all developments, the site-specific development plan, for purposes of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., shall be as defined in this Chapter. 
(b)  In the event an applicant for a site-specific development plan approval wishes said approval to have the effect of creating vested property rights pursuant to Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., the applicant must so request, in writing, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date said application is to be considered by the City Council. 
(c)  In the event amendments to a site-specific development plan are proposed and approved, the effective date of such amendments, for purposes of duration of a vested property right, shall be the date of the approval of the original site-specific development plan, unless the body granting final approval of such amendments specifically finds to the contrary and incorporates such finding in its approval of the amendment. 
(d)  The City Council may revoke a vested property right for failure to abide by the terms and conditions of such vested property right. Prior to taking action to revoke a vested property right, the City Council shall provide a public hearing to the affected landowner and shall provide at least fourteen (14) days' prior written notice mailed to the property address of record in the County Assessor's office, as well as provide notice in the same manner as the posting or publishing of ordinances and resolutions. The mailed notice to the landowner shall specifically identify the terms and conditions which are not in compliance with the site-specific development plan approval. During the period of determining compliance with the terms and conditions of a site-specific development plan approval, the City may administratively withhold any building, utility, excavation, road cut or other City permit, and may withhold acceptance of additional development applications or processing of existing development applications for the property subject to the site-specific development plan. 
(e)  A pending site-specific development plan application will be governed by the duly adopted laws and regulations in effect at the time the application is submitted, with the exception that the City reserves the right pursuant to Section 24-6-102.5(2), C.R.S., to enforce new or amended laws or regulations to pending applications when such law or regulation is necessary for the immediate preservation of public health and safety, including temporary development restrictions duly adopted by ordinance for the purposes of preparing planning studies and considering land use regulations related to public health and safety or for the purpose of promoting concurrency of essential public infrastructure, equipment or services with increased demand. 
(f)  Nothing in this Section is intended to create any vested property right, but only to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S. In the event of the repeal of said Article or a judicial determination that said Article is invalid or unconstitutional, this Section shall be deemed to be repealed and the provisions hereof no longer effective.

(3)  Relation to general pattern of urban development. PUD districts shall be planned and located in general compliance with the Comprehensive Plan and shall relate to the major elements of the urban pattern, including housing, commercial facilities and principal places of employment, by physical proximity of major streets so as to provide for the convenience and amenity of residents of the community and to reduce general traffic congestion by a close relationship between origins and destinations. 
(f)  Physical character of the site. The site shall be suitable for the development proposed without hazards to structures, occupants or any property from probability of flooding on the site or on adjacent lands, from erosion or deposition of eroded material on adjacent lands, from subsidence of the soils or from other dangerous conditions. Soil, groundwater level, drainage and topography shall be appropriate to both the kind and pattern of use intended. 
(g)  Site planning; external relationships. 
(1)  Vehicular access. Entrances and exits for vehicles shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with minimum hazards to passing traffic or to traffic entering or leaving the development. Merging or turnout lanes may be required where anticipated traffic flows from or to the PUD indicate the need for such lanes.

(c)  Integrate parking lots with surroundings. Parking lots shall not dominate the frontage of pedestrian-oriented streets, interfere with designated pedestrian or bicycle routes or negatively impact surrounding neighborhoods. The pedestrian character of streets and buildings shall be maximized through continuity of buildings and landscape frontage. 
(d)  Off-street parking design. Any off-street parking area shall be designed so that vehicles may exit without backing onto a public street unless no other practical alternative is available. Off-street parking areas shall be designed so that parked vehicles do not encroach upon or extend onto public rights-of-way or sidewalks or strike against or damage any wall, vegetation, utility or other structure. 
(e)  Circulation. Circulation areas shall be designed to facilitate the safe movement of vehicles without posing a danger to pedestrians or impeding the function of the parking area. 
(f)  Lighting. All parking area lighting shall be full cut-off type fixtures. Any light used to illuminate parking areas or for any other purpose shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from nearby residential properties and away from the vision of passing motorists. 
(g)  In all commercial zone districts, it shall be unlawful to allow parking or storage of any vehicle outside of an enclosed structure on an off-street unimproved surface, or utilize access to and from public rights-of-way on an unimproved surface, except that this Section shall not apply to rear lot or back lot areas behind buildings that abut unimproved public rights-of-way. 
(h)  Shared-access. Where feasible, and in order to reduce traffic and vehicle turning movements on major streets, parking lots shall share access drives and cross-access easements with adjacent property with similar land uses. 
(i)  In all residential zone districts, it shall continue to be unlawful to create and allow new parking areas or to create storage areas for any vehicle outside of an enclosed structure on an off-street unimproved surface or create access to and from public rights-of-way without asphalt or concrete paving of such areas according to existing City standards, except for rear lot or backyard areas that abut unimproved public rights-of-way. 
(j)  In all residential zone districts, it shall be unlawful to allow parking or storage of any vehicle outside of an enclosed structure on an off-street unimproved surface, or utilize access to and from public rights-of-way on an unimproved surface. This Section shall not apply to rear yards that abut unimproved public rights-of-way. This Subsection shall not apply to owner-occupied residences until six (6) months after such property is sold or otherwise transferred. 
(k)  In all industrial zone districts, it shall be unlawful to park or store any vehicle outside of an enclosed structure (except on rear lot or back lot areas behind buildings) on an off-street unimproved surface, or utilize access to and from public rights-of-way on an unimproved surface, in connection with a business located within one hundred (100) feet of residential or commercial uses. 
(l)  Unimproved parking surface. As used herein, the term unimproved shall be any surface which is not paved with concrete or asphalt, with appropriate base preparation, according to the expected weight loading, as determined by the Public Works Department, except that driveway rock is not an acceptable improvement to newly created parking areas and access. Older properties that have been using unimproved parking and access before 1994 may install attractive and well-maintained driveway rock to comply with this Code provision, but parking and access areas for new homes and commercial buildings and those creating new parking areas and access on existing homes and commercial buildings must use concrete or asphalt for such parking. 
(m)  In all residential zone districts, front yard areas may not have more than three (3) improved spaces (approximate maximum width of thirty [30] feet), but notwithstanding anything stated above, an auxiliary parking space in addition to a single- or double-space improved driveway parking area may be rocked as specified in Subsection (l). 
(n)  As used herein, the definition of vehicle shall include pickup camper shells and slide-in campers, and any recreational or other vehicle or apparatus that may be driven, operated or towed upon any street, waterway or trail. 
(o)  No owner or person in control of property (such as a lessee) shall cause or allow parking, storage or access in violation of this Section.

Sec. 16-86. - Joint parking facilities. 
    Whenever two (2) or more uses are located close together in a common building, shopping center, commercial zone district or integrated building complex, the parking requirements may be complied with by providing a common parking facility, cooperatively established and operated, which contains the required number of spaces for each use. The total number of spaces provided shall not be less than the sum of the individual requirements. However, if the uses would not be operated during the same hours, the number of automobile parking spaces shall be determined by the use with the highest parking demand. 
(Ord. 2006-869 Pt. 1) 
Sec. 16-87. - Off-street parking space construction, landscaping and maintenance. 
(a)  Access and circulation. Curb cuts should be limited to the fewest number necessary to provide workable access. In general, curb cuts shall conform to the City of Fort Lupton Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements and should be spaced at intervals greater than one hundred (100) feet, unless this would preclude access to an independent property. 
(b)  Parking lots on adjoining multi-family, commercial and industrial developments should provide for convenient off-street connections and mutual access easements in order to minimize the need for vehicles to use public streets to move between such adjoining properties. 
(c)  Parking stall dimensions. Parking spaces for automobiles should meet the specifications as set forth below. 
(1)  Standard spaces. For the purpose of these parking space regulations, the term parking space shall be defined as an off-street, hard-surfaced, dust-free space designed and intended to be occupied by a parked automobile. The length and width of the required parking spaces, the width of the aisle within a parking area and the ratio of oversized, full-sized and handicap spaces shall be as indicated in the table below, Minimum Parking Standards.

(2-way) A 60:40 parking ratio shall apply to oversized and full-sized vehicles. Sixty percent (60%) of spaces shall be reserved for full-sized vehicles and forty percent (40%) of spaces shall be reserved for oversized vehicles. This assumes that the required number of handicap parking spaces will be incorporated.  
(2)  Handicap spaces. Properly designed and convenient parking spaces shall be provided for people with physical handicaps as provided by law. All such handicap parking spaces shall comply with this Chapter and with other applicable law. 
(d)  Layout. Parking lots shall provide well-defined circulation for both vehicles and pedestrians. 
(1)  Standard traffic-control signs and devices shall be used to direct traffic where necessary within a parking lot. 
(2)  Landscaped islands with raised curbs shall be used to define parking lot entrances, the ends of all parking aisles and the location and pattern of primary internal access drives. 
(3)  The layout shall specifically address the interrelation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation and provide specific treatment at points of conflict such as signs, painted crosswalks and raised pedestrian walks or landings. 
(4)  Parking lot setback landscaping. Parking lot setback areas required by this Chapter shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs and ground cover or turf grasses in accordance with an approved site plan. Nonliving ground cover shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of areas required to be landscaped. For nonresidential uses, trees shall be provided as follows: not less than one (1) tree per twenty-five (25) lineal feet along a public street; and one (1) tree per fifty (50) lineal feet along a side lot line parking setback area. Trees may be spaced irregularly in natural grouping rather than uniformly spaced. Parking setback landscaping along streets may be located in and shall be incorporated with landscaping in the street right-of-way. 
(5)  Screening. Parking lots with six (6) or more parking spaces must be screened from adjacent residential lots with landscaping, berms or fencing, sufficient to substantially block light from vehicle headlights and according to an approved site plan. Shrub groupings, berms, hedges, planters or a mix thereof shall be provided to provide partial screening from adjacent streets. Where screening from the street is required, site plans submitted for review shall include a graphic depiction of the parking lot screening as seen from the street. The winter seasonal condition of plant material will be considered when it is used in meeting screening performance standards. 
(6)  Visibility. To avoid landscape material from blocking driver sight distance at driveway/street intersections, no plant material greater than two (2) feet in height shall be located within the sight triangle as specified in Chart A. 
(7)  Internal landscaped areas. Landscaped islands shall be dispersed so as to improve parking lots by providing visual relief with vertical landscape elements and physical relief with seasonal tree shading. Trees shall generally be provided in number equal to at least one (1) tree per one hundred fifty (150) square feet of internal landscaped area. A mix of shade trees and evergreen shrubs is encouraged. 
(8)  Landscaped islands. Each landscaped island shall include one (1) or more full-sized trees, shall be of length greater than eight (8) feet in its smallest dimensions, shall include at least eight (8) square feet of ground area per tree to allow for aeration and shall have raised concrete curbs. 
(9)  Irrigation. Provisions shall be made for permanent irrigation of all plant material in parking lots. Normally, an automatic underground irrigation system is the most cost-effective solution. 
(e)  Bicycle parking. Commercial, industrial and multi-family residential uses shall provide bicycle parking facilities. 
(1)  A minimum number of bicycle parking facilities shall be provided, equal in number to not less than two percent (2%) of the total number of automobile parking spaces required to be provided by the development, but not less than one (1) bicycle parking facility. 
(2)  Location. For convenience and security, bicycle parking facilities shall be located near building entrances rather than in remote automobile parking areas. They shall not, however, be located so as to impede pedestrian or automobile traffic flow nor so as to cause damage to plant material from bicycle traffic. 
(3)  Design. Bicycle parking facilities shall be designed to allow both the bicycle frame and both wheels to be securely locked to the parking structure. The structure shall be of permanent construction such as heavy gauge tubular steel with angular bars permanently attached to the pavement foundation. A typical bicycle space shall be two (2) to three (3) feet in width and five and one-half (51/2) to six (6) feet in length with an additional back-out or maneuvering space of approximately five (5) feet.

ARTICLE VI - Floodplain 

Sec. 16-121. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation, which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the public. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(c)  All fees for a development permit shall be as shown in the "City of Fort Lupton General Fee Schedule," as adopted by resolution by the City Council. 
(Ord. 2014-974 §1) 
Sec. 16-122. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to critical facilities, infrastructure and other public facilities and utilities such as water, sewer and gas mains; electric and communication stations; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area; and 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the property in a flood hazard area assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 2014-974 §1) 
Sec. 16-123. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this Article, the following words shall have the meanings ascribed hereafter: 
    100-year flood means a flood having a recurrence interval that has a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded during any given year ( 1-percent-annual-chance flood ). The terms one-hundred-year flood and one-percent chance flood are synonymous with the term 100-year flood . The term does not imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every one hundred (100) years. 
    100-year floodplain means the area of land susceptible to being inundated as a result of the occurrence of a one-hundred-year flood. 
    500-year flood means a flood having a recurrence interval that has a 0.2-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded during any given year (0.2-percent-chance annual flood). The term does not imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every five hundred (500) years. 
    500-year floodplain means the area of land susceptible to being inundated as a result of the occurrence of a five-hundred-year flood. 
    Addition means any activity that expands the enclosed footprint or increases the square footage of an existing structure. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means a fan-shaped sediment deposit formed by a stream that flows from a steep mountain valley or gorge onto a plain or the junction of a tributary stream with the main stream. Alluvial fans contain active stream channels and boulder bars and recently abandoned channels. Alluvial fans are predominantly formed by alluvial deposits and are modified by infrequent sheet flood, channel avulsions and other stream processes. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated Zone AO or AH on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident.

    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. The statewide standard for the designated height to be used for all newly studied reaches shall be one-half (1/2) foot (six [6] inches). Letters of Map Revision to existing floodway delineations may continue to use the floodway criteria in place at the time of the existing floodway delineation. 
    Freeboard means the vertical distance in feet above a predicted water surface elevation intended to provide a margin of safety to compensate for unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood, such as debris blockage of bridge openings and the increased runoff due to urbanization of the watershed.

    Special flood hazard area means the land in the floodplain within a community, subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year; i.e., the 100-year floodplain. 
    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, including substantial improvements, provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basements, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, which is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure just prior to when the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before start of construction of the improvement. The value of the structure shall be determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority in the area of interest. This includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) means a quantity designated for each chemical on the list of extremely hazardous substances that triggers notification by facilities to the State that such facilities are subject to emergency planning requirements. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this Article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this Article. (For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations). 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

    In order to accomplish its purposes, this Article includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling, filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 2014-974 §1) 
Sec. 16-125. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which this Article applies. This Article shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas and areas removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) within the jurisdiction of Fort Lupton, Colorado. 
(b)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The Special Flood Hazard Areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Fort Lupton, Colorado," dated October 1978, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and/or FBFM), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Article. These Special Flood Hazard Areas identified by the FIS and attendant mapping are the minimum area of applicability of this Article and may be supplemented by studies designated and approved by the City Council. The Floodplain Administrator shall keep a copy of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), DFIRMs, FIRMs and/or FBFMs on file and available for public inspection. 
(c)  Establishment of development permit. A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this Article. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered or have its use changed within the Special Flood Hazard Area without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations. Any person who violates this Article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall be subject to penalties as set forth in Section 1-72 of this Code. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. These regulations meet the minimum requirements as set forth by the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Article and another article, ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Article, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Article does not imply that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Article shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(h)  Severability. This Article and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this Article be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the Article as a whole, or any portion thereof, other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 2014-974 §1)

(2)  Review, approve or deny all applications for Floodplain Development Permits required by adoption of this Article. 
(3)  Review Floodplain Development Permit applications to determine whether a proposed building site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
(4)  Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C., 1334) from which prior approval is required. 
(5)  Inspect all development at appropriate times during the period of construction to ensure compliance with all provisions of this Article, including proper elevation of the structure. 
(6)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard Area (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. 
(7)  When Base Flood Elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Article 3, Section B, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any Base Flood Elevation data and Floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this Section. 
(8)  For waterways with Base Flood Elevations for which a regulatory Floodway has not been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one-half (1/2) foot at any point within the community. 
(9)  Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE and AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one-half (1/2) foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA (Conditional Letter of Map Revision), fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of Section 65.12 and receives FEMA approval. 
(10)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Agency, which is the Colorado Water Conservation Board, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to FEMA. 
(11)  Ensure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(c)  Permit procedures. Application for a Floodplain Development Permit shall be presented to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to the Special Flood Hazard Area.

(2)  Elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any nonresidential structure has been floodproofed; 
(3)  A certificate from a registered Colorado professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of Paragraph 16-127(b)(2); 
(4)  A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development. 
(5)  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with Subsection 16-126(b). 
Approval or denial of a Floodplain Development Permit by the Floodplain Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this Article and the following relevant factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
(4)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
(5)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(6)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems. 
(7)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
(8)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
(9)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use. 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(d)  Variance procedure. 
(1)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 16-122 of this Article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this Article, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this Article as stated in Section 16-122 of this Article. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the Base Flood Elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(6)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that: 
a.  The criteria outlined in this Subsection (d) are met; and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(7)  Appeal Board. 
a.  The Board of Adjustment, as established by the City, shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variance from the requirements of this Article. 
b.  The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Planning Department in the enforcement or administration of this Article. 
c.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Weld County District Court, as provided in Section 31-23-307, C.R.S. 
d.  In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors and standards specified in other sections of this Article and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage. 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program of that area. 
9.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after the flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges. 
e.  Upon consideration of the factors of Paragraph (d)(1) above and the purposes of this Article, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Article. 
f.  The Planning Department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(3)  Utilities. 
a.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
b.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the system into floodwaters. 
c.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
d.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(4)  Subdivision proposals. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. 
d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in Subsection 16-125(b), or in Paragraph 16-126(c)(2) of this Article, the following standards are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer, architect or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. With the exception of critical facilities, outlined in Subsection (h) of this Section, new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that at one (1) foot above the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
A registered Colorado professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this Subsection. Such certification shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator, as proposed in Subsection 16-126(c) above. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two (2) openings, having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding, shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home, electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) are elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of the above Paragraph, shall be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home, electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) are one (1) foot above the base flood elevation; or 
b.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and are securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM shall either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of this Article and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Paragraph (4) above. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions. 
(6)  Prior approved activities. Any activity for which a Floodplain Development Permit was issued by the City or a CLOMR was issued by FEMA prior to January 27, 2014 may be completed according to the standards in place at the time of the permit or CLOMR issuance and will not be considered in violation of this Article if it meets such standards. 
(c)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the Special Flood Hazard Area established in Subsection 16-125(b) of this Article are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Residential construction. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least three [3] feet if no depth number is specified). Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer, architect or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. With the exception of critical facilities, outlined in Subsection 16-127(h) below, all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least three [3] feet if no depth number is specified), or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. A registered Colorado professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Subsection 16-125(c) of this Article, are satisfied. 
Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes are required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(d)  Floodways. Floodways are administrative limits and tools used to regulate existing and future floodplain development. The State has adopted floodway standards that are more stringent than the FEMA minimum standard (see the definition of Floodway in Section 16-123 of this Article). Located within the Special Flood Hazard Area established in Subsection 16-125(b) of this Article are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway, unless it has been demonstrated, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a licensed Colorado professional engineer and in accordance with standard engineering practice, that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase (requires a No-Rise Certification) in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If Paragraph (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Section. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in Base Flood Elevations, provided that the community first applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(e)  Alteration of a watercourse. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse within a Special Flood Hazard Area, the following standards apply: 
(1)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall appropriately consider issues of sediment transport, erosion, deposition and channel migration and properly mitigate potential problems through the project, as well as upstream and downstream of any improvement activity. A detailed analysis of sediment transport and overall channel stability should be considered, when appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design. 
(2)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall evaluate the residual 100-year floodplain. 
(3)  Any channelization or other stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory floodplain and be in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local floodplain rules, regulations and ordinances. 
(4)  Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a registered Colorado professional engineer or certified professional hydrologist. 
(5)  All activities within the regulatory floodplain shall meet all applicable federal, state and city floodplain requirements and regulations. 
(6)  Within the regulatory floodway, stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the project proponent demonstrates through a floodway analysis and report, sealed by a registered Colorado professional engineer, that there is not more than a 0.00-foot rise in the proposed conditions compared to existing floodway conditions resulting from the project, otherwise known as a No-Rise Certification, unless the community first applies for a CLOMR and Floodway revision in accordance with Subsection 16-127(d) above. 
(7)  Maintenance shall be required for any altered or relocated portions of watercourses so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(f)  Properties removed from the floodplain by fill. A Floodplain Development Permit shall not be issued for the construction of a new structure or addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) unless such new structure or addition complies with the following: 
(1)  Residential construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) must be elevated to one (1) foot above the Base Flood Elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) must be elevated to one (1) foot above the Base Flood Elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure or addition is watertight to at least one (1) foot above the base flood level that existed prior to the placement of fill, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(g)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision or other development proposal is in a flood-prone area, the proposal shall minimize flood damage. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Floodplain Development Permit requirements of Subsection 16-125(c); Subsection 16-126(c); and the provisions of this Section. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Subsections 16-125(b) or 16-126(b) of this Article. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(h)  Standards for critical facilities. A critical facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that, if flooded, may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood. 
(1)  Classification of critical facilities. It is the responsibility of the City Council to identify and confirm that specific structures in their community meet the following criteria: 
Critical facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) essential services; (b) hazardous materials; (c) at-risk populations; and (d) vital to restoring normal services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities and transportation lifelines. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage and emergency operation centers); 
2.  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions, and nonambulatory surgical structures, but excluding clinics, doctors' offices and nonurgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
3.  Designated emergency shelters; 
4.  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables and conduits); 
5.  Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines and service lines); and 
6.  Air transportation lifelines (airports [municipal and larger]), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions and associated infrastructure (aviation control towers, air traffic control centers and emergency equipment aircraft hangars). 
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), nonpotable water treatment and distribution systems and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances. 
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this Article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City Council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include: 
1.  Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing); 
2.  Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials; 
3.  Refineries; 
4.  Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and 
5.  Aboveground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers. 
Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place, AND the chemical is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either five hundred (500) pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the three hundred fifty-six (356) chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), also known as Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS); or ten thousand (10,000) pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this Article, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations. 
Specific exemptions to this category include: 
1.  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
2.  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority), that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
3.  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. 
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this Article. 
c.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care and schools. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Elder care (nursing homes); 
2.  Congregate care serving twelve (12) or more individuals (day care and assisted living); 
3.  Public and private schools (pre-schools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school care serving twelve [12] or more children); 
d.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services including government operations. These facilities consist of: 
1.  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); 
2.  Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices and classrooms only). 
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the City Council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this Article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City Council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
(2)  Protection for critical facilities. All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the Special Flood Hazard Area shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this Article, protection shall include one (1) of the following: 
a.  Location outside the Special Flood Hazard Area; or 
b.  Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two (2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation. 
(3)  Ingress and egress for new critical facilities. New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the City Council, have continuous noninundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100-year flood event.

ARTICLE VI - Design Standards 

Sec. 17-60. - Design standards. 
    The general location and alignment of streets and lot size shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan and zoning requirements of the City. The design and construction of all public and private improvements within the subdivision shall conform to adopted building codes, the City of Fort Lupton Residential Design Standards, the City of Fort Lupton Commercial and Industrial Design Standards and the City of Fort Lupton Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements, as revised. 
(Ord. 2006-869 Part 1; Ord. 2007-888, Part 4; Ord. 2007-895, Part 5) 
Secs. 17-61-17-69. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII - Public Land Dedication 

Sec. 17-70. - General. 
(a)  Intent. Applicants for approval of new subdivisions that create a demand for parks, schools and public facilities shall be required to dedicate and, if necessary, reserve sufficient and appropriate land and/or funds to purchase sufficient land to accommodate such public facilities. 
(b)  Land dedication. Payments and dedications made under the requirements of this Section shall be made payable or dedicated to the City at the time of final plat approval. Land dedicated to the City shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. The applicant shall provide for the installation of all street improvements adjacent to dedicated park and school sites, the installation of water, sewer and other public utilities to dedicated park and school site property lines, and overlot grading of the park and school sites. 
(c)  Land reservation. In addition to any requirement for dedication of land for public facilities, the City may require reservation of additional lands within the boundaries of a proposed subdivision when such reservation is necessary to provide viable sites for public facilities. Reservation of such additional land shall be for purchase at fair market value, or for other mutually agreeable consideration, within a reasonable period of time. Terms of the reservation shall be included in the subdivision improvements agreement. 
(d)  Use of dedicated land. Land dedicated for public use under the provisions of this Chapter shall be used for parks, schools, fire stations or other public facilities. Land or fees for school sites may be transferred to the School District according to agreements between the City and the District. Use of dedicated land may be specified in the subdivision improvements agreement. 
(e)  Fee in lieu of dedication. If there is not sufficient property on the plat to provide land for the entire school, park or other public facility required, with the approval of the City Council, the subdivider may, in lieu of dedication of all or part of the land requirements, pay fees equivalent to the value of required land dedication. Fees are to be calculated in the following manner: 
(1)  Fees shall be calculated based on the full market value of the land, assuming that the plat has been approved and proper zoning exists. 
(2)  Full market value shall be determined by mutual agreement between the subdivider and the City Council. In the event of inability of any of the above parties to agree on the value of the required land dedication, the subdivider shall submit to the City a written appraisal from a qualified appraiser meeting the value requirements set forth herein. Said appraisal shall be made by an individual or entity that does not have a financial interest in the subdivision and shall be a member of the Appraisal Institute, a member of the Society of Real Estate Appraisers or such other qualified person mutually agreeable to the administrator and the applicant. The applicant shall pay the cost of said appraisal. 
(3)  Such appraisal may be submitted during the review period of the final plat. If the City Council believes that the appraised value is not accurate, it may obtain its own appraisal from a qualified appraiser or determine the fair market value by such procedure as the City Council deems appropriate. 
(4)  All fees in lieu of dedications are to be paid prior to the approval of the final plat unless otherwise agreed by the City Council in the subdivision improvements agreement. 
(5)  For subdivisions that are platted in phases, the above calculations can be made on a phase-by-phase basis through methods to be devised by the City Council realizing that, by virtue of developing one (1) phase, the value of the undeveloped adjacent phase will increase. The subdivider has the option of paying the fees for all phases upon the due date of fees for the first phase. 
(f)  Land unacceptable for dedication. Land proposed for dedication shall be appropriate for the proposed uses as determined by the City Council in its sole discretion. Small remnants of land, rugged or hazardous sites, drainage ways, land encumbered by easements and land that is otherwise inappropriate for public use will not be acceptable in fulfillment of public land dedication requirements. 
(g)  Plat of dedicated and reserved land. The final subdivision plat shall include all land to be dedicated or reserved for public use as separate and defined tracts. The plat shall include appropriate dedication certifications as required by the City. 
(Ord. 2006-869 Part 1) 
Sec. 17-71. - Requirements. 
(a)  Land dedication requirements for residential subdivisions. 
(1)  The amount of land to be dedicated to the City as a condition of approval of a final plat of a residential subdivision shall be ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) residents who might potentially occupy the subdivision. Residential occupancy shall be calculated at a rate of three (3) residents per single-family dwelling, and two and one-half (2.5) residents per multi-family dwelling. The number of potential dwellings within a subdivision shall be the maximum number of units that could be built on the property, considering the subdivision configuration and the ultimate zoning. 
(2)  School sites. The amount of land to be dedicated to the City or cash in lieu of land for school sites as a condition of approval of a final plat shall be based on the prevailing student generation and corresponding facility demand estimates published by the School District. 
(b)  Land dedication requirements for nonresidential subdivisions. The amount of land to be dedicated to the City as a condition of approval of a final plat of a nonresidential subdivision shall be five percent (5%) of the gross land area within the subdivision.

(Ord. 2001-781 §1) 
Sec. 18-9. - Requirements for small wind energy systems. 
(a)  Definition. Small wind energy system means a wind energy conversion system consisting of up to three (3) wind turbines, towers and associated control or conversion electronics, which have a rated capacity of not more than one hundred (100) kilowatts and which are intended to primarily reduce on-site consumption of utility power. 
(b)  Permitted use. Small wind energy systems shall be permitted uses or special uses as provided by this Code, subject to certain qualifications and criteria as set forth below: 
(1)  Height. Total height, including blade length, shall not exceed sixty (60) feet. 
(2)  Setback, minimum lot size and access restriction. No part of the wind system structure, including guy wire anchors, may extend closer than ten (10) feet to the property boundaries of the installation site. Placement must be such that if the system collapses, no occupied structure on adjacent property is within its collapse zone. It is understood that this restriction may prevent most residential zone placement. If physical access to the system by business invitees or even trespassers, like children, would pose a danger by climbing on or otherwise touching the system, adequate access restriction must be constructed. Minimum lot size for each unit is four thousand (4,000) square feet. 
(3)  Noise. Small wind energy systems shall not exceed sixty (60) dBA, as measured at the closest corner of the closest neighboring residential structure, or eighty (80) dBA, as measured from the closest corner of the closest neighboring business structure. The level, however, may be exceeded during severe wind storms, as the combination of high wind, high rotation and wind turbulence around the tower or guy wires may temporarily exceed these noise standards. 
(4)  Wind turbines. Small wind turbines must have been approved under the Emerging Technologies program of the California Energy Commission or any other small wind certification program recognized by the American Wind Energy Association and must demonstrate by those approvals or otherwise that the system meets accepted standards of safety under tornadic conditions. 
(5)  Compliance with International Building Code. Building permit applications for small wind energy systems shall be accompanied by standard drawings of the wind turbine structure, including the tower, base and footings. An engineering analysis of the tower showing compliance with the International Building Code and certified by a licensed professional engineer shall also be submitted. This analysis is frequently supplied by the manufacturer. Wet stamps shall not be required. 
(6)  Compliance with FAA regulations. Small wind energy systems must comply with applicable FAA regulations, including any necessary approvals for installations close to airports. 
(7)  Compliance with National Electric Code. Building permit applications for small wind energy systems shall be accompanied by an engineer's stamped one-line drawing of the electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a determination that the manner of installation conforms to the National Electrical Code. This information is frequently supplied by the manufacturer. 
(8)  Utility notification. No small wind energy system shall be installed until evidence has been given that the utility company is informed and has approved the customer's intent to install an interconnected customer-owned generator. Off-grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement. 
(9)  Color. The tower cannot be painted another color other than the manufacturer's color without consent of the Planning Department. The Planning Department shall use its discretion consistent with the concept colors being compatible with the area in question. 
(10)  Advertising. The tower shall not be used for advertising purposes. No signs, lettering, balloons, banners or other attention-getting media shall be placed on the tower other than high voltage signs and other signs that exhibit manufacturer warnings and statistical information about the system.

Sec. 18-56. - Erosion and migration control and abatement. 
    In addition to all other references in the International Building Code to erosion control and abatement, the following provisions shall apply to all construction projects, subdivision improvements and land grading or moving projects within or affecting property within the City: 
(1)  It is unlawful to begin a project for construction of structures, improvements to real property (such as underground utility infrastructure, street or landscaping installment or repair) or earth moving or grading, until a plan for applied water or storm water, or dust and mud erosion and migration control has been submitted to and approved by the Building Official and Public Works Manager. 
(2)  It is unlawful to disobey a stop work order issued under the authority of this Section. 
(3)  Any work on projects not having an approved erosion control plan or not applying or continuing to apply the plan properly to the project may be stopped on order of the Building Official or Public Works Manager or any law enforcement officer. A stop work order may, at first, be issued orally, but if the order is to be effective for more than forty-eight (48) hours, it shall be put in writing within forty-eight (48) hours of its issuance, citing the violation and what is needed to be done to recommence the project. The project may not continue until a plan has been approved and properly applied to the project. 
(4)  Any erosion plan must include provisions to mitigate water, dust or mud potentially migrating from the property to adjacent property or streets, alleys or rights-of-way or easements of another. 
(5)  Immediate action by the owner, contractor or persons working on any project must be taken to reduce or eliminate, if reasonably possible, the failure of a plan to mitigate off-property water, dust or mud migration. Any work on the project may be ordered stopped to prevent further migration until a revised plan or implementation occurs. Any work may be ordered stopped until clean-up occurs of any damage, refuse or residual mud. 
(6)  Violation of any of these provisions may subject the owner, manager, contractor or all persons working in violation of these provisions to being arrested and charged with a criminal violation and/or subject to damages and/or injunctive relief in civil court. Arrest should only be made if unauthorized work continues after a stop work order has been issued. 
(7)  After oral or written warning, the City may abate violations of this Section and the owner or contractor shall be liable for the cost of such abatement, and such costs may become a lien upon the subject property through direct filing by the City or by collection of the lien as a tax upon the property through the County Treasurers office. Abatement may occur for a lack of an approved control plan (example: erecting barriers where inadequate provision has been made on a project), failure to properly apply and continue to apply an approved plan or changing a plan where new evidence or circumstance has warranted different or increased measures. 
(8)  This Section does not apply to ongoing street and infrastructure maintenance projects of the City itself, projects at existing single-family residences, projects at existing commercial properties in a C1 or C2 zone district or emergency actions such as floodwater control.

All such application shall be reviewed by the Board in two (2) phases to determine compliance with this Article as follows: 
(1)  Conceptual review. Conceptual review is an opportunity for applicants to discuss requirements, standards and policies that apply to historic sites or structures within a historic district. Problems can be identified and solved prior to final review of the application. After review of the application by the Historic Preservation Board, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall furnish the applicant with written comments regarding the conceptual review. Conceptual approval of any proposed work may be limited to certain portions of the work as deemed appropriate by the Board. Conceptual approval does not guarantee final approval of proposed work. If, upon review of the proposed work, the Board determines that conceptual review is not necessary given the absence of a significant impact on the historic site or historic district involved, it may be waived by the Board and the Board may then proceed to consider the proposed work on final review at the same meeting. 
(2)  Final review. If an application or parts thereof are conceptually approved, it shall be finally reviewed by the Historic Preservation Board at a subsequent meeting of the Board. During final review, the Board shall consider the application or parts thereof that have received conceptual approval and any changes made by the applicant since conceptual review. 
(Ord. 651, 1994) 
Sec. 18-355. - Work not requiring building permit; application for approval.

(a)  If upon receipt of an application for a building permit pursuant to Section 18-354, or upon receipt of an application pursuant to Section 18-355, the Historic Preservation Board finds that the proposed work is of a nature that will not erode the authenticity or destroy any distinctive exterior feature of the improvements and is compatible with the distinctive characteristics of the historic site or historic district and within the spirit of purposed of this Article, the Board shall advise the applicant in writing by issuing a report of acceptability and shall affix its seal to the plans and specifications for the approved work. In the case of an application for a building permit, upon receipt of the Board's report of acceptability, the Building Inspector shall proceed with the review of the application for a building permit. No change which would defeat the purpose of this Article shall be made in an application for a building permit or the plans and specifications for the proposed work approved by the Board without resubmittal to the Board and approval of such changes in the same manner as the original application. 
(b)  In determining the decision to be made concerning the issuance of a report of acceptability, the Historic Preservation Board shall consider the following criteria:

(3)  The effects of the proposed work in creating, changing or destroying the exterior architectural features of the structure upon which such work is to be done; 
(4)  The effect of the proposed work upon the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the historic site or historic district; 
(5)  The Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines of Rehabilitating Historic Buildings; and

Sec. 18-357. - Denial of building permit. 
    If the proposed work is not approved by the Historic Preservation Board, the Building Inspector shall deny the application for the Building permit and shall advise the applicant. No reapplication shall be submitted pursuant to Section 18-354, et seq., under the original plans and specifications found unacceptable by the Board except upon a showing of changed circumstances sufficient to justify the reapplication. 
(Ord. 651, 1994) 
Sec. 18-358. - Action of Board on unacceptable proposed work. 
(a)  If the proposed work is not acceptable, the Historic Preservation Board, acting with all due diligence, shall explore with the applicant all means for substantially preserving the historic structure or historic district which would have been affected by the required permit. These investigations may include, by way of example and not of limitation: 
(1)  Feasibility of modification of the plans; 
(2)  Feasibility of any alternative private use of the structure which would substantially preserve the original character; or 
(3)  Possibility of public acquisition for a public purpose of the structure involved. 
(b)  If the Historic Preservation Board is unsuccessful in developing either alternate plans or an appropriate public or private use for such structure, which are acceptable to the applicant, it shall notify the owner and the Building Inspector in writing. No work, erection, construction, reconstruction or alterations or demolitions of landmarks or structures in historic districts shall be allowed except on approval of the Board as provided in this Article.

Any such officer, department or authority shall take immediate steps to notify the Historic Preservation Board of the proposed issuance of any such order or directive and may include in such order or directive any timely received requirements or recommendations of the Board. 
(Ord. 651, 1994) 
Sec. 18-360. - Final decision. 
    Decisions of the Historic Preservation Board regarding the acceptability of applications for building permits under Section 18-354 or applications for approval of work not requiring a building permit under Section 18-355 shall be considered final decisions.

CHAPTER 19 - Metropolitan Districts 
ARTICLE I - General Provisions 

Sec. 19-1. - Declaration and purpose. 
(a)  The City Council finds that the City is located within or in the vicinity of a number of special districts, including but not limited to one (1) or more water, sanitation, park and recreation, fire and ambulance districts. The City Council recognizes that the creation of metropolitan districts pursuant to Section 32-1-101, et seq., C.R.S., within the City may create jurisdictional confusion and questions relating to the provision of public services and the means by which those services are financed. The City Council recognizes that the creation of additional metropolitan districts can result in the unnecessary proliferation, overlap and fragmentation of local government, as well as double taxation and the diffusion of local tax sources. Nonetheless, the City Council declares that the creation of metropolitan districts, in the limited circumstances set forth in this Chapter, can facilitate the provision of governmental services by providing alternatives for financing public improvements and services. The City Council further declares that the purposes of this Chapter are to establish policies concerning the use of metropolitan districts for the initial construction and financing of public improvements, but to limit the provision of ongoing services by such districts, which may be organized within the City boundaries. The City Council recognizes a need for procedures designed to ensure the orderly processing of proposals for the formation of metropolitan districts, and for policies and limitations that will allow the City Council full discretion in determining the needs of the community in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens. 
(b)  The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth general and nonbinding guidelines relating to the formation of metropolitan districts within the City. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish procedures to be followed for the proposed formation of a metropolitan district, as that term is defined by Section 32-1-103(10), C.R.S., within the City's boundaries, pursuant to Section 32-1-101, et seq., C.R.S. Without limitation, the purposes of these guidelines are to avoid having indebtedness of metropolitan districts affect the credit rating of the City; to preserve the financial integrity of the City and its citizens; to prevent the shifting of development risk to nondevelopers; to attempt to minimize and insulate the City from risks and controversies that may arise in relation to metropolitan districts; to attempt to minimize excessive tax burdens upon City residents in special districts; to set forth the circumstances under which a metropolitan district may receive favorable consideration from the City; to articulate the types of benefits that are expected to inure to the City and its citizens generally in the proposed formation of a metropolitan district; and to avoid the shifting of costs of any metropolitan district to citizens who are not within the geographic boundaries of a metropolitan district or receiving benefit from it. The guidelines contained in this Chapter are general in nature, may be considered by the City Council among such other information and decision-making criteria as the City deems appropriate and shall vest no right in any individual or entity relating to the creation of any metropolitan district. The City Council retains all authority and discretion to reject, approve or approve with conditions any special district proposal on which the City is authorized or required to act. The adoption of this Chapter is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City. 
(Ord. 2005-854 §1) 
Sec. 19-2. - Scope and authority. 
(a)  This Chapter sets forth: 
(1)  The threshold criteria pursuant to which the City may review each proposal for the creation of a metropolitan district and evaluate the benefits, which will accrue to the City or the affected properties; 
(2)  The application elements of a proposed metropolitan district service plan which are considered to be the minimum criteria under which the City will proceed to review a metropolitan district proposal; and 
(3)  The criteria and situations where a metropolitan district may be viewed as an appropriate and efficient financing vehicle, absent other considerations which the City Council may determine to take into account. 
(b)  Pursuant to the power vested in the City by Sections 32-1-204 and 205, C.R.S., no metropolitan district shall be created within the City's boundaries without the approval of the City Council, as evidenced by a City Council resolution, after a public hearing thereon. 
(c)  This Chapter establishes the requirements for the presentation of a proposal for the creation of a metropolitan district to the City Council and the general criteria the City Council may choose to consider, among other criteria, in making a determination as to the approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the creation of a metropolitan district. 
(Ord. 2005-854 § 1) 
Sec. 19-3. - Definitions. 
    When used in this Chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
City  Administrator means the City Administrator of the City of Fort Lupton or such Administrator's designee. 
Metropolitan  district means a quasi-municipal corporation and political subdivision proposed, organized or acting pursuant to Section 32-1-101, et seq., C.R.S., and in accordance with this Chapter, that provides for the inhabitants thereof any two (2) or more of the following services: fire protection, mosquito control, safety protection, parks and recreation, sanitation, solid waste disposal facilities for collection and transportation of solid waste, street improvement, television relay and translation, transportation or water. 
(Ord. 2005-854 § 1) 
Sec. 19-4. - Policy goals, objectives and considerations. 
(a)  Policy goals. The City's goal is to be prepared to use the most appropriate financing alternative available for the construction of public improvements designed to serve all residential development, new commercial and industrial developments and redevelopment within the City's boundaries or service areas. In addition, establishment of these guidelines is intended to facilitate compliance with and furtherance of the policies set forth in the City's Land Use Plan, Utilities Master Plan, Traffic Plan, Drainage Master Plan, Capital Projects Plan and other such plans and policies as the City Council may adopt, as well as the coordination of planned development within the City's extended planning area and additional growth areas. Through the approval of a proposed metropolitan district, potentially, the City could achieve four (4) goals: 
(1)  Constructing certain public improvements with non-City funds and reducing the financing burden therefor; 
(2)  Expediting the provision of certain public improvements or services in cooperation with a metropolitan district; 
(3)  Enhancing the level of public improvements or services within the City and metropolitan district in cooperation with a metropolitan district; or 
(4)  In some circumstances, assisting the private sector as well, by cooperating in projects beneficial to both public and private entities. 
(b)  Policy objectives. As set forth in this Subsection, the City may consider the creation of a metropolitan district when, in the sole discretion of the City Council, the formation of a district is in the City's best interest and in the best interests of the area to be served. Circumstances which may indicate that a district may be an appropriate financing alternative within the City's boundaries or within the extended service area include: 
(1)  Where the public improvements to be constructed provide a general benefit to all or a portion of City residents and have previously been established as a portion of a system-wide municipal project, as set forth in the City's Land Use Plan, Traffic Master Plan, Master Drainage Plans, Utilities Master Plan, Capital Projects Plan, Parks and Trails Master Plan or any other public facility document that the City may adopt, but where construction financing for a particular portion of a system-wide municipal project has not been budgeted or is not adequately funded in a given current year in the City's capital projects fund. Such projects could include, by way of example and not limitation, portions of major transportation improvements, enhanced or major recreational facilities and major open space or natural features as identified in the Parks and Trails Master Plan. 
(2)  Where the public improvements will serve commercial or industrial redevelopment projects or new developments which will enlarge materially the City's tax base. 
(3)  Where the public improvements will serve commercial, industrial or residential development, which will enhance the entire community, with a special emphasis on the quality of the proposed development or redevelopment project. 
(4)  Where the financing burden would be imposed primarily on those properties specially benefited. 
(5)  With respect to public improvements which, pursuant to the City's then-current development policies and applicable ordinances, are the obligation of the adjacent, surrounding or nearby properties, where the public improvements are disproportionately large and financially burdensome in comparison to the benefit received by the affected properties. 
(6)  With respect to residential projects, where the development is of sufficient size to merit consideration of a public improvements program other than upon a plat-by-plat basis. 
(7)  Where the development is proposed to be and remain under a single plan of control, with assurance of the same provided to the City, such that the City Council may determine that the programs articulated at the time of service plan consideration will not be fragmented or diluted. 
(8)  With respect to residential projects, where the development process has proceeded to a point where it may be determined that the programs articulated at the time of service plan consideration can be carried out in the development of the area to be included within the district. 
(9)  Where the City Council makes a determination, in its sole discretion, that creation of a district is necessary or desirable, for reasons of economies of scale, construction timing, coordination with other public improvements or the preservation of the health, safety and general welfare of the City's citizens. 
(c)  Review considerations. In addition to other elements and information set forth in this Chapter, those districts that include the following provisions as part of their organizational proceedings may be more favorably considered: 
(1)  A report from the City Administrator that the proponents for the proposed district have submitted all necessary information as required by this Chapter or otherwise reasonably requested in review of the proposed service plan, and that the City staff has made a recommendation on the formation of the proposed district. 
(2)  A provision that all improvements constructed by the district will be subject to inspection by the City in such form and fashion as necessary to ensure compliance with the City's approval of applicable plans and permits. 
(3)  Unless otherwise provided for and specifically approved by the City, a provision that all facilities constructed by the district would be conveyed to the City or another entity designated by the City, free and clear of any lien, claim, encumbrance or demand, subject to the City's normal warranty procedures. 
(4)  A prohibition against the provision of any ongoing services and operations or maintenance of facilities, unless the City Council specifically approves the district's proposal to provide continuing services. 
(5)  A requirement of written notice and disclosure will be provided to the initial and subsequent purchasers and users of the properties within the district regarding the existence, operations and additional taxes, fees, charges or assessments, which will be imposed in connection with the district. 
(6)  To the extent possible, provisions designed to minimize the financial impact upon the purchasers and users of the properties within the district and minimize the risk of bond defaults. Towards this end, the City Council may look more favorably upon financing plans that place limitations on financing beyond the limitations set forth in applicable state laws and regulations. 
(7)  Provisions ensuring that the district, once created, will be subject to the City's zoning, subdivision, building code and other land use requirements. 
(8)  A requirement that the proponents of the district and the district, upon formation, will indemnify the City against all liabilities associated with the district, its formation and its plan of financing. 
(9)  Assurances from the proponents of the district that the financial information and forecasts, costs accounting, engineering information and marketing projects within the service plan are reasonable, appropriate and consistent with all applicable laws. 
(10)  Provisions that the metropolitan district shall take all action necessary to dissolve, pursuant to Section 32-1-701, et seq., C.R.S., if the City files an application with the metropolitan district for district dissolution pursuant to Section 32-1-701(3), C.R.S. 
(d)  Consideration of appropriateness. While not determinative of City policies or criteria, the City may give more favorable consideration to a proposed metropolitan district in the following situations: 
(1)  Where the proponents can demonstrate that the creation of the district will create a distinct benefit to the greater City community or a greater area within the City that will not otherwise be realized; 
(2)  Where the proponents can demonstrate that the creation of the district is essential to the realization of unique development or undertaking within the district that would not otherwise be realized; 
(3)  Where the proponents can demonstrate that the creation of a separate government entity within the City will foster and promote the goals, policies and objectives of the City in a way that promotes continuity of government services and the avoidance f interjurisdictional conflicts; 
(4)  When the City Council determines that the creation of the district is a necessary and appropriate method by which pertinent interests, goals and policies of the City can be achieved, beyond interests of the proponents and the area to be served; 
(5)  When the City Council determines that creation of the district will create or encourage economies of scale, favorable timing or both, with respect to planned or anticipated public improvements, that would not otherwise be realized; 
(6)  Where the proponents can demonstrate that the district's independent authority to control the construction of improvements will inure to the benefit of the City; or 
(7)  Where it is not anticipated that an existing and larger district or entity will be created or used as a financing vehicle for major area-wide public improvements, including by way of example and not limitation, drainage improvements. 
(Ord. 2005-854 § 1)

(c)  Considerations of review. 
(1)  Upon completion of City staff review of the proposed service plan, the proposal shall be set for consideration by the City Council pursuant to a schedule set by the City. The City staff shall present a report to the City Council evaluating the service plan and identifying any unresolved issues and issues of concern to City staff. Such report shall include recommendations made in accordance with the review criteria set forth in this Subsection. Such recommendations will be sufficient to allow the City Council to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the creation of the metropolitan district on a basis consistent with this Chapter. 
(2)  The City Council shall disapprove the service plan unless evidence satisfactory to the City Council of each of the following is presented: 
a.  There is sufficient existing and projected need for organized services in the area to be serviced by the proposed metropolitan district. 
b.  The existing service in the area to be served by the proposed metropolitan district is inadequate for present and projected needs. 
c.  The proposed metropolitan district is capable of providing economical and sufficient facilities and services to the area within its proposed boundaries. 
d.  The area to be included in the proposed metropolitan district has, or will have, the financial ability to discharge the proposed bond financing on a reasonable basis. 
(3)  In considering whether to approve a proposed district, the City Council may also choose to apply the following criteria, in addition to such other information or other criteria as it deems appropriate and pertinent in making a decision: 
a.  Whether adequate service is not or will not be available to the area through the City or other existing municipal or quasi-municipal corporations, including existing special districts, within a reasonable time and on a comparable basis. 
b.  Whether the facility and service standards of the proposed metropolitan district are compatible with the facility and service standards of the City. 
c.  Whether the proposal is in substantial compliance with the guidelines of this Chapter. 
d.  Whether the proposal is in compliance with the City's Land Use Plan, Utilities Master Plan, Traffic Master Plan, Drainage Master Plan, Capital Projects Plan and other such plans and policies as the City Council may adopt, as well any duly adopted county, regional or state long-range infrastructure or service standard plan for the area (such as a statewide Transportation Improvement Program or a Water Quality Management Plan). 
e.  Whether the creation of the proposed metropolitan district will be in the best interests of the area proposed to be served. 
f.  Whether the proposed uses in the metropolitan district will significantly contribute to the maintenance or expansion of the community's economic base. 
g.  Whether the proposed metropolitan district will result in the guaranteed construction or funding of extraordinary infrastructure, such as roads, water or sewer lines, storm drainage or parks intended to serve community or regional needs greater than needs of the residential development subject to the request. 
h.  Whether the proposed metropolitan district fulfills community goals or needs identified by City Council as deserving particular attention or provides particular unique community benefits. 
i.  Whether there is or will be sufficient valuation in the metropolitan district boundaries to support the proposed debt issuance. 
j.  Such other criteria unique to the proposed metropolitan district and deemed appropriate for consideration by the City Council. 
(4)  If disapproval is not required by Paragraph (2) above, it is entirely within the discretion of the City Council to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the creation of a metropolitan district within the City's boundaries. Any such decision by the City Council will be a legislative and not a quasi-judicial act, and no person shall have any right, by virtue of this Chapter or otherwise, to create a special district within the City's boundaries. 
(5)  Exclusions. The City Council may exclude territory from a proposed metropolitan district prior to approval of the service plan submitted by the proposed metropolitan district. The proponents of the metropolitan district shall have the burden of proving that the exclusion of such property is not in the best interest of the metropolitan district. Any person owning property in the geographic area of the proposed metropolitan district who requests his or her property to be excluded from the metropolitan district shall submit a written request for exclusion to the City Council at or prior to the hearing in order to be considered. However, the City Council shall not be limited in its action with respect to exclusion of territory based only upon such request.

This Section shall not impair the right of the City to bring an action in the district court to enjoin the activities of any special district. 
(4)  A resolution of approval shall not be required for changes of a technical nature necessary only for the execution of the original service plan. The City shall determine if a change is technical in nature. 
(c)  Any material departure from the service plan as originally approved, except for technical changes as referred to in Paragraph (b)(4) of this Section or, if such has been modified, from the service plan as modified, may be enjoined by the Court, upon its own motion; the City, by appropriate court action; or any interested party by appropriate court action, as the term "interested party" is defined by Section 32-1-204(1), C.R.S.
