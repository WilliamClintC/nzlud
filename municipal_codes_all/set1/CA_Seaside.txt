Unless waived by the person, the time specified in the notice to appear must be at least ten days after arrest.

B. The officer shall deliver one copy of the notice to appear to the arrested person, and the arrested person in order to secure release must give his written promise so to appear in court by signing the duplicate notice which shall be retained by the officer. Thereupon, the arresting officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody.

1.16.050 Liability for costs.

Any person against whom such civil action is filed shall be liable for the costs thereof, which shall include but not be limited to the costs of investigation, court costs, attorney’s fees, and costs of monitoring compliance. (Ord. 743 § 2, 1988)


1.16.060 Enforcement by administrative process – Powers of enforcing officer.

A. Nothing in this code or any other city enactment is intended, or shall be deemed or construed, to impose a liability upon the city, or any of its officers, agents or employees, for any injury to persons or damage to property alleged to result from any act or omission by the city, or any of its officers, agents or employees, beyond the liability imposed by the state of California or by the United States. Nothing in this code or any other city enactment is intended, or shall be deemed or construed, to impose a mandatory duty on the city, or any of its officers, agents or employees, for the purpose of determining entitlement to equitable relief or liability to any injury to persons or damage to property alleged to result from the failure of the city or any of its officers, agents or employees to discharge a mandatory duty imposed by this code or any city enactment.

B. Every enforcing officer may use administrative processes such as notices of violation, stop work orders, or warning letters, in lieu of or prior to seeking judicial enforcement of any provision of this code or city ordinance if the officer determines that the process may result in compliance with this code at less cost to the city. Failure of any enforcing officer to use an administrative process shall not affect the validity of any judicial proceeding undertaken pursuant to this code or other city ordinance.

C. Every enforcing officer is authorized to appear as a complaining witness in any criminal proceeding brought for an alleged violation of this code, and in every administrative or civil proceeding brought to abate any violation of this code or to enjoin any present or future violation of this code.

D. Whenever there is cause to suspect a violation of any provision of SMC Title 15; or the city zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, property maintenance ordinance or other city ordinance relating to real property; or whenever necessary to investigate either an application for granting, extension or modification of any application described in said code or ordinances, or an action to revoke or modify a discretionary permit, the enforcing officers or their duly authorized representatives may enter any site for the purpose of investigation, provided they shall do so in a reasonable manner. No owner, occupant or agent thereof shall, after reasonable notice and opportunity to comply, refuse to permit such entry. In the course of such inspection, no enclosed building or structure shall be entered without the express permission of the owner or occupant. When necessary and with the prior approval of the city attorney, the enforcing officers may apply to the court for an inspection warrant.

E. No person shall give either orally or in writing information to an enforcing officer which the person knows to be false. (Ord. 774 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990)


1.16.070 Notice of violation recordation.

If in the course of fulfilling their responsibilities under SMC Title 15, or the city zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, property maintenance ordinance or other city ordinance relating to real property, the enforcing officer has knowledge that there is a violation thereof, the enforcing officer shall cause to be mailed to the owner, as reported on the latest equalized assessment roll, and/or the occupant if different from the owner, a notice of intention to record a notice of violation. The notice shall include a description of the property, a description of the violation, the action necessary to abate the violation, the time limit for compliance, the intent to record the notice of violation, and state a time, date and place for a meeting with the enforcing officer at which the occupant or owner may present evidence as to why the notice shall not be recorded.

If the occupant or the owner of the real property fails to inform the enforcing officer of his objections to the recordation of the notice of violation and the violation has not been cured within the time limit set for compliance, the enforcing officer may record a notice of violation with the county recorder. If the owner or occupant has presented evidence and it is determined that there has been no violation, the enforcing officer shall not record the notice of violation. If, however, after the owner or occupant has presented evidence, the enforcing officer determines that a violation does exist, the enforcing officer shall record a notice of violation after the expiration of the time for compliance. (Ord. 774 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990)


1.16.080 Removal of notice of violation.

If the owner, occupant or authorized agent disagrees with the determination that a violation of SMC Title 15, or the city zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, property maintenance ordinance or other city ordinance relating to real property, exists on the property, said individual may apply for a “removal of notice of violation” by submitting evidence to the enforcing officer that there is no violation or that the work to abate the violation has been completed. An adverse decision of the enforcing officer may be appealed by the property owner to the planning commission.

Appeals to the planning commission shall be in writing and shall be filed within ten days after written notice of the decision of the enforcing officer has been mailed to the applicant.

The enforcing officer shall remove the notice of violation when:

A. It is determined by the enforcing officer or appeal body that no violation exists; or

B. All required work to abate the violation has been completed and approved by the enforcing officer.

The fee for the submittal of the “removal of notice of violation” shall be set from time to time by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 774 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990)


1.16.090 Refusal to issue permits, licenses or other entitlements.

No department, commission or public employee of the city which is vested with the duty or authority to issue or approve permits, licenses or other entitlements shall issue or approve such permits, licenses or other entitlements where there is an outstanding violation involving the property upon which there is a pending application for such permit, license or other entitlement. The authority to deny shall apply whether the applicant for the permit was the owner of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant is either the current owner of record or an agent or successor in interest of the current owner of record pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property, with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of his or her interest in such real property.

Upon notification that a violation exists by the enforcing officer, all departments, commissions and public employees shall refuse to issue permits, licenses or entitlements involving the property except those necessary to abate the violation, if such are obtainable.

Written notice of the refusal to issue shall be mailed to the applicant for the permit, license or entitlement and to the property owner. Such written notice shall include information regarding the specific violation and the action necessary to abate the violation.

If the applicant for a permit, license or other entitlement disagrees with the determination that a violation exists, the applicant may follow the procedure set forth in SMC 1.16.080.

The refusal to issue shall be rescinded when the department, commission or employee has been notified that:

A. It has been determined by the enforcing officer or appeal body, after review, that no violation exists; or

B. All required work to abate the violation has been completed and approved by the enforcing officer or his designee.

The building official may waive the provisions of this section for remedial, protective or preventative work needed to deal with an emergency situation. (Ord. 774 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990)


1.16.100 Fees for retroactive permit application.

Application for permits for any use for which a permit is required and where the use has been constructed, placed on the property, operated or has been otherwise established or initiated prior to the application for the permit, in violation of city ordinance, shall require a fee of twice the amount normally charged for the application. (Ord. 774 § 2 (Exh. A), 1990)

Article I. Rules of Procedure


2.02.010 Applicability – Purpose.

The rules of procedure set forth in SMC 2.02.020 through 2.02.460 are applicable to city council meetings and hearings and are intended to apply as well, insofar as possible, to the meetings and hearings of all city boards and commissions. These rules are intended to implement the basic proposition, applicable to Seaside and to other general law cities of the state, that each member of the city council has one vote and that the duties and powers of the city council are vested in the city council as a body and not in the individual mayor and council member acting separately. Additionally, these rules are intended to facilitate and expedite the work of the city council and to insure that the will of the majority is effectively translated into the city council action without undue hindrance or obstruction. The city operates under the council-manager form of the government under which the city council establishes fundamental policy but deals with matters of personnel and policy implementation through the city manager and not through direct contact with subordinate city employees. These rules are intended to expedite the aforesaid principles and insure their proper application. (Ord. 1034 § 3, 2017; Ord. 382, 1970; prior code § 1-200(Preamble))


2.02.020 Meetings – Regular.

The city council shall hold regular meetings on the first and third Thursday of each month at seven p.m.; provided, that when the day fixed for any regular meeting falls upon a day designated by law as a legal or national holiday, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding day not a holiday, or on such other day as may be designated by the city council, in the council chambers of the City Hall, 440 Harcourt Avenue, Seaside, or at such other place within the city limits to which the meeting may be adjourned. If by reason of fire, flood, or other emergency, it is unsafe to meet in the City Hall, the meetings may be held for the duration of the emergency at such other place as is designated by the mayor or by three members of the city council. Except by an affirmative majority vote of the city council, no agenda items shall be taken up after ten-thirty p.m. (Ord. 880 § 2, 1999; Ord. 551 § 1, 1980; Ord. 538 § 1, 1979; Ord. 519 § 1, 1978; Ord. 498, 1977; Ord. 480, 1977; Ord. 448, 1974; Ord. 382, 1970; prior code § 1-200(A-1))


2.02.030 Meetings – Adjournment.

Any meetings may be adjourned at a time, place, and date certain, but not beyond the next regular meeting. Once adjourned, the meeting may not be reconvened unless there is unanimous consent of the council. (Ord. 382, 1970; prior code § 1-200 (A-2))


2.02.040 Meetings – Special.

Special meetings may be called at any time by the mayor, or by three members of the city council, by causing notice to be delivered personally to the city manager, assistant city manager, or deputy city clerk, who shall in turn notify each councilmember and each local newspaper of general circulation twenty-four hours before the time of such meetings as specified in the notice. The call and notice shall specify the time and place of the special meetings and the business to be transacted. No other business shall be considered at such meetings. Such written notice may be dispensed with as to any councilmember who at or prior to the time the meeting convenes files with the city clerk a written waiver of notice.

(Ord. 583 § 3, 1981; prior code § 1-456)


2.42.090 Disqualification – Grounds.

A. No designated employee shall make, participate in making, or use his or her official position to influence the making of any governmental decision which will foreseeably have a material financial effect, distinguishable from its effect on the public generally, on:

1. Any business entity in which the designated employee has a direct or indirect investment worth more than one thousand dollars;

2. Any real property in which the designated employee has a direct or indirect interest worth more than one thousand dollars;

3. Any source of income, other than loans by a commercial lending institution in the regular course of business on terms available to the public without regard to official status, aggregating two hundred fifty dollars or more in value provided to, received by, or promised to the designated employee within twelve months prior to the time when the decision is made; or

4. Any business entity in which the designated employee is a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or holds any position of management.

B. No designated employee shall be prevented from making or participating in the making of any decision to the extent his or her participation is legally required for the decision to be made. The fact that the vote of a designated employee who is on a voting body is needed to break a tie does not make his or her participation legally required for purposes of this section. (Ord. 583 § 3, 1981; prior code § 1-457)


2.42.100 Disqualification – Manner.

When a designated employee determines that he or she should not make a governmental decision because he or she has a financial interest in it, the determination not to act must be accompanied by disclosure of the financial interest. In the case of a voting body, this determination and disclosure shall be made part of the city’s official record; in the case of a designated employee who is the head of a department, this determination and disclosure shall be made in writing to his or her appointing authority; and, in the case of other designated employees, this determination and disclosure shall be made in writing to the designated employee’s supervisor. (Ord. 583 § 3, 1981; prior code § 1-458)


2.42.110 Assistance of commission and counsel.

Any designated employee who is unsure of his or her duties under this code may request assistance from the Fair Political Practices Commission pursuant to Government Code Section 83114, or from the attorney for his or her agency to issue any formal or informal opinion. (Ord. 583 § 3, 1981; prior code § 1-459)


2.42.120 Violation – Penalty.

A. This code has the force and effect of law. Designated employees violating any provision of this code are subject to the administrative, criminal, and civil sanctions provided in the Political Reform Act, Government Code Sections 81000 through 91014.

B. In addition, a decision in relation to which a violation of the disqualification provisions of this code or of Government Code Section 87100 has occurred may be set aside as void pursuant to Government Code Section 91003. (Ord. 583 § 3, 1981; prior code § 1-460)

III. Consultants. Consultants are defined for reporting purposes who prepare a product or perform services of a general nature and/or on an ongoing basis and participate by direct advice to the decision-makers. Generally, consultants who prepare a product or perform services for single specific matters are not the type of consultants required to be covered by a code, whereas consultants who provide more general assistance and advice to a government agency on an ongoing basis should be covered.

Consultants shall be included in the list of designated employees and shall disclose pursuant to the broadest disclosure category in the code subject to the following limitation:

The city manager may determine in writing that a particular consultant, although a “designated position,” is hired to perform a range of duties that are limited in scope and thus is not required to fully comply with the disclosure requirements in this section.

Such written determination shall include a description of the consultant’s duties and, based upon that description, a statement of the extent of disclosure requirements.

The city manager’s determination is public record and shall be retained for public inspection in this same manner and location as this conflict of interest code. (Ord. 1049 § 2, 2018; Ord. 1034 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1018 § 2, 2014; Ord. 956 § 3 (Appx. A), 2006; Ord. 888 § 4 (Appx. A), 2000; Ord. 736 § 1, 1988; Ord. 583 (Exh. A), 1981)

*    These officials are listed for disqualification purposes only. They are required to file disclosure statements pursuant to Article 2 of the Political Reform Act.1

Designated employees who are required to file statements of economic interests under any other agency’s conflict of interest code, or under Article 2 for a different jurisdiction, may expand their statement of economic interests to cover reportable interests in both jurisdictions, and file copies of this expanded statement with both entities in lieu of filing separate and distinct statements; provided, that each copy of such expanded statement filed in place of an original is signed and verified by the designated employee as if it were an original. See Government Code Section 81004. 2

See Government Code Section 81010 and 2 California Administrative Code Section 18115 for the duties of filing officers and persons in agencies who make and retain copies of statements and forward the originals to the filing officer. 3

For the purpose of disclosure only (not disqualification), an interest in real property does not include the principal residence of the filer. 4

Investments and interests in real property which have a fair market value of less than one thousand dollars are not investments and interests in real property within the meaning of the Political Reform Act. However, investments or interests in real property of an individual include those held by the individual’s spouse and dependent children as well as a pro rata share of any investment or interest in real property of any business entity or trust in which the individual, spouse and dependent children own, in the aggregate, a direct, indirect or beneficial interest of ten percent or greater. 5

A designated employee’s income includes his or her community property interest in the income of his or her spouse, but does not include a salary or reimbursement for expenses received from a state, local or federal government agency. 6

Income of a business entity is reportable if the direct, indirect or beneficial interest of the filer and the filer’s spouse in the business entity aggregates a ten percent or greater interest. In addition, the disclosure of persons who are clients or customers of a business entity is required only if the clients or customers are within one of the disclosure categories of the filer.

Every effort should be made to find an acceptable solution by informal means at the lowest possible level of supervision.

If the employee does not agree with the decision, or if no answer has been received within ten days, he may present the appeal in writing to the department head. Failure of the employee to take further action within ten days if no decision is rendered will constitute a withdrawal of the grievance.

Failure of the employee to take further action within ten days after receipt of the decision, or within a total of twenty days if no decision is rendered, will constitute withdrawal of the grievance.

D. City Manager. The city manager, or his designated representative, should discuss the grievance with the employee, his representative, if any, and with other appropriate persons. The city manager may designate a fact-finding committee, or an officer not in the normal line of supervision, to advise him/her concerning the appeal. The appointing power shall render a decision in writing to the employee within twenty days after receiving the grievance. (Ord. 1042 § 2 (Att. A), 2017; Ord. 442 § 1, 1974; prior code § 1-418(b).

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, purchases of supplies, services and equipment of an estimated cost greater than twenty-five thousand dollars, where such work is not a public project, shall be by written contract with the lowest responsive bidder who submits a responsive bid pursuant to the following procedure:

A. Allocation has been provided in the adopted annual city budget or the city council has made available funds for such a purchase and its expense.

B. Department heads and the purchasing officer will develop written specifications for supplies, services and equipment to be procured. Services identified in SMC 3.04.100 may be purchased by the competitive negotiation process. Written specifications must be adequately detailed to avoid ambiguity. Trade definitions/terminology are suggested for clarity in developing concise specifications. Adequate specification research is necessary to enable bidders to be responsive.

C. The purchasing officer will solicit sealed bids from all known responsive prospective suppliers. When deemed necessary by the city, bidders’ security may be prescribed in the specifications provided bidders. Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security upon successful execution of his contractual obligation. The purchasing officer will arrange publishing legal notice inviting bids. Legal notice and solicitation will specify the hour and date sealed bids must be received by the purchasing officer, and the bid opening time. Bids received as unsealed or after the specified hour and date will be rejected and returned to the bidder as a nonresponsive bid.

D. Bid opening will be conducted by the purchasing officer and attended by the department head requesting the bidded supplies, services, or equipment, and one additional individual designated by the city manager. This group will serve as the source selection committee for the bidded supplies, services, or equipment. The purchasing officer will open, announce, and record the sealed bids submitted. After bid opening and recording, the source selection committee will scrutinize accepted bids for specification conformance and responsiveness. The source selection committee will recommend for city council approval, the lowest submitted bid meeting specification conformance.

E. The city council may, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next lowest responsive bidder. If the city council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security shall be applied by the city to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. If the city council rejects all bids presented, due to the failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, and readvertises, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security may be used to offset the cost of soliciting and receiving new bids and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder.

F. At its discretion, the city council may reject any and all bids presented and readvertise for bids pursuant to the procedure prescribed in this section. In the event no bids are received or that all bids substantially exceed the city’s estimate of cost for the purchase, the city council may reject all bids and direct the purchasing officer to proceed pursuant to open market or competitive negotiation sections of this chapter.

G. If two or more bids received are the same amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the city council may, in its discretion, accept the lowest bid made by and after negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening.

H. The city shall have authority to require a performance, and labor and materials bond before entering into a contract in such amount as it finds reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the city. If the city requires a performance bond, the form amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2006; Ord. 587 § 2, 1981; prior code § 2-305)

When awards are given to someone other than the lowest responsive bidder, a statement as to why another vendor was more advantageous to the city shall be kept on file for a period of one year, and shall be open to public inspection.

2. The supplies or equipment are such that suitable technical or performance specifications are not readily available, the city is not able to develop descriptive specifications, and proposals for the purchase would be more advantageous to the city.

B. When the purchases are made by competitive negotiations, the best offer as judged against proposal evaluation criteria shall be accepted. The use of competitive negotiations is not intended to be used for the purpose of avoiding the bidding procedures as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 587 § 2, 1981; prior code § 2-310)


3.04.110 Cooperative purchasing.

D. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 439 § 4, 1973)


3.20.050 Contract with state.

Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

3.21.010 Title.

This chapter shall be known as the Seaside transactions and use tax ordinance. The city of Seaside hereinafter shall be called “city.” This chapter shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of the city. (Ord. 1041 § 1, 2017; Ord. 967 § 3, 2007)


3.21.020 Operative date.

“Operative date” means the first day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than one hundred ten days after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the date of such adoption being June 6, 2017. (Ord. 1041 § 1, 2017; Ord. 967 § 4, 2007)


3.21.030 Purpose.

The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A. To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt the tax ordinance codified in this chapter which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

B. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the sales and use tax law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes.

D. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1041 § 1, 2017; Ord. 967 § 6, 2007. Formerly 3.21.040)


3.21.040 Contract with state.

Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of the transactions and use tax ordinance codified in this chapter; provided, that if the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract. (Ord. 1041 § 1, 2017; Ord. 967 § 5, 2007. Formerly 3.21.030)


3.21.050 Transactions tax rate.

For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the city at the rate of one and one-half percent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 1041 § 1, 2017; Ord. 967 § 7, 2007)


3.21.060 Place of sale.

For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 1041 § 1, 2017; Ord. 967 § 8, 2007)


3.21.070 Use tax rate.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

A. Wherever the state of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this city shall be substituted therefor. However, the substitution shall not be made when:

1. The word “State” is used as a part of the title of the State Controller, State Treasurer, State Board of Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California.

2. The result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against this city or any agency, officer, or employee thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.

3. In those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the result of the substitution would be to:

a. Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; or

b. Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provision of that code.

b. With respect to commercial vehicles, by registration to a place of business out-of-city and declaration under penalty of perjury, signed by the buyer, that the vehicle will be operated from that address.

5. For the purposes of subsections (C)(3) and (4) of this section, storage, use, or other consumption, or possession of, or exercise of any right or power over, tangible personal property shall be deemed not to be obligated pursuant to a contract or lease for any period of time for which any party to the contract or lease has the unconditional right to terminate the contract or lease upon notice, whether or not such right is exercised.

6. Except as provided in subsection (C)(7) of this section, a retailer engaged in business in the city shall not be required to collect use tax from the purchaser of tangible personal property, unless the retailer ships or delivers the property into the city or participates within the city in making the sale of the property, including, but not limited to, soliciting or receiving the order, either directly or indirectly, at a place of business of the retailer in the city or through any representative, agent, canvasser, solicitor, subsidiary, or person in the city under the authority of the retailer.

3.24.010 Definitions.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter.

“Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

“Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

“Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sub-lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

“Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

“Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

“Short-term rental” means a dwelling unit where the owner with the majority interest in the residential property, or an owner holding an equal shared interest if no other owner owns a greater interest, allows for a habitable portion thereof in part or as a whole for the transient use occupancy by visitors the same as for a hotel.

“Tax administrator” shall be appointed by the city manager.

“Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 1054 § 6, 2018; Ord. 1042 § 2 (Att. B), 2017; Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 589 § II(9), 1981; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-601)


3.24.020 Imposition.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administration may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord. 795 § 1, 1991; Ord. 644, 1983; Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 514 § 1, 1978; Ord. 412 § 1, 1972; Ord. 335, 1968; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-602)


3.24.030 Exemptions.

A. No tax shall be imposed upon:

1. Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax as herein provided;

2. Any federal or state of California officer or employee when on official business;

3. Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

B. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. (Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-603)


3.24.040 Operator’s duties.

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and upon request each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in SMC 3.24.110. (Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-604)


3.24.050 Registration of hotels – Issuance of certificate.

Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a “transient occupancy registration certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A. The name of the operator;

B. The address of the hotel;

C. The date upon which the certificate was issued; and

D. The following statement:

This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit.

(Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-605)


3.24.060 Reporting and remitting.

Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar month, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. (Ord. 644, 1983; Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-606)


3.24.070 Penalties and interest.

A. Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

B. Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed.

C. Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section.

D. Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E. Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid by this chapter. (Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-607)


3.24.080 Failure to collect and report tax – Determination of tax by tax administrator.

If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any portion thereof, required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken. (Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-608)


3.24.090 Appeal procedure.

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in SMC 3.24.080 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-609)


3.24.100 Recordkeeping.

It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

3.24.110 Refunds.

A. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section; provided, a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

B. An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax had been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

D. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-611)


3.24.120 Collection of tax.

A. Actions to Collect. Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount.

B. Recording Certificate – Lien. If any amount required to be paid to the city under the ordinance codified in this chapter is not paid when due, the administrator may within three years after the amount is due file for record in the office of the Monterey County recorder a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the operator liable for the same and the fact that the tax administrator has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be paid together with penalties and interest constitutes a lien upon a real property in the county owned by the operator or acquired by him afterwards and before the lien expires. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged.

C. Priority and Lien of Tax. The amount required to be paid by any operator under this chapter with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases:

1. Whenever the person is insolvent;

2. Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his assets;

3. Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors, administrators or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased; or

4. Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter is levied upon by process of law. This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien.

D. Warrant for Collection of Tax. At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount herein required to be paid off within ten years after the last recording of a certificate of lien under subsection B of this section, the tax administrator may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any sheriff, marshal or constable and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy of and a sale pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator may pay or advance to the sheriff, marshal or constable the same fees, commissions and expenses for his services as are provided by law for similar services pursuant to a writ of execution.

E. Seizure and Sale. At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount, the tax administrator may forthwith collect the amount in the following manner: The tax administrator shall seize any property, real or personal, of the operator and sell the property, or a sufficient part of it, at public auction to pay the amount due together with any penalties and interest imposed for the delinquency and any costs incurred on account of the seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect occupancy taxes due shall be only of property of the operator not exempt from execution under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.

F. Successor’s Liability – Withholding by Purchaser. If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out his business or quits the business, his successor assignee shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.

G. Liability of Purchaser – Release. If the purchaser of a hotel fails to withhold funds from the purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty days from the date the former owner’s records are made available for audit, whichever period expires the later, but in any event, not later than ninety days after receiving the request, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the tax administrator to mail the notice shall release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs the later.

H. Sale of a hotel, dismissal of the operator or other termination of his rights to operate the facility shall not relieve him from liability for taxes due or owing under this chapter. (Ord. 805 § 1 (Exh. A), 1992; Ord. 601 § II(4), 1982; Ord. 284, 1964; prior code § 3-612)

(Ord. 1054 § 6, 2018)


3.24.130 Violations – Misdemeanor.

In addition to any other state or city penalties or enforcement procedures, violation of any of the provisions of this chapter may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor.

Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made is guilty of a misdemeanor, in addition to any other remedies provided by law.

If any service supplier fails to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the collector shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the collector procures the facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any service supplier who has failed or refused to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such service supplier the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter.

If such application is made, the collector shall give not less than ten days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in subsection A of this section to the service supplier to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At the hearing, the service supplier may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed.

C. Determination of Tax Following Hearing – Notice When Due. After a hearing on the amount of tax assessed, the collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted, and shall thereafter give written notice to the service supplier in the manner prescribed in subsection A of this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

The collector shall notify the service user that he has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, plus any penalty imposed and such interest as may be due pursuant to the provisions of SMC 3.30.160. The notice shall be served on the service user by handing to him personally or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the service supplier required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have changed his address, to his last known address.

C. Hearing – Determination. The council shall have authority to determine all questions raised on such appeal at the time of the hearing. No determination so made by the council shall conflict with any substantive provisions in this chapter. (Ord. 642 § 1, 1983)


3.30.190 Records.

It shall be the duty of every service supplier required to collect and remit to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax that such service supplier may have been requested to collect and remit to the city, which records the collector shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 642 § 1, 1983)


3.30.200 Refunds.

A. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty or perjury the specified grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the collector within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the collector.

B. A service supplier may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted an amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the collector that the service user from whom the tax has been collected did not owe the tax; provided, however, that neither the refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the service user or credited to charges subsequently payable by the service user to the service supplier.

C. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 642 § 1, 1983)


3.30.210 Exemptions.

A. Eligibility. Any service user who is sixty-five years of age or older and who is personally responsible for the payment of the utility services subject to this tax and who personally pays for those services shall be eligible for an exemption from the taxes imposed by this chapter on service supplied to the service user’s residential living quarters. Only one such residential exemption shall be allowed to any person. The person in whose name the utility services are established with the utility companies will be deemed to be the person personally responsible for purposes of this section. The provisions of this exemption shall also apply to any individual who meets the criterion of disability, as established by the Social Security Administration’s Supplemental Security Income Program for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (Title XVI of the Social Security Act as amended), without regard to the age of the disabled individual.

B. Application. Applications for exemption may be filed with the collector at any time on such forms as he may provide.

C. Effective Date. The exemption will not be effective until seventy-five days after receipt of the application by the collector.

D. Contents of Application. Applications shall be verified by declaration under penalty of perjury and shall contain such information as may be required by the collector.

E. Review and Certification. The collector shall review each application and shall certify the service users as exempt if the eligibility requirements of subsection A of this section are met, except that no exemption shall be granted to a service user who is receiving service from a service supplier through a master meter and no exemption shall be granted with respect to any tax imposed by this chapter which is or has been paid by a public agency or where the service user receives funds from a public agency specifically for the payment of such tax.

F. Notice to Service Supplier. If a service user is certified as exempt, the collector shall promptly notify service user’s service suppliers, stating the name of the service user, the address to which such exempt service is being supplied, the account number, if any, and such other information as may be necessary for the service supplier to remove the exempt service user from its tax billing procedure.

G. Discontinue Billing Service User. Upon receipt of such notice, the service supplier shall within sixty days discontinue billing service user for taxes imposed by this chapter, except as otherwise provided in subsection H of this section.

H. Prior Taxes to Be Collected. Taxes billed by the service supplier to the service user prior to removing the service user from its tax billing procedure shall be collected from the service user and the service user shall pay such taxes to the service supplier. Taxes billed to and paid by the service user between the time that the application for exemption is filed and the service supplier removes the service user from its taxing procedure will not be refunded to the service user.

I. Duration of Exemption. Exemptions certified by the collector shall continue so long as the facts supporting the qualification for exemption shall exist; provided, however, that the exemption shall automatically terminate with any change in the service address or residence of the exempt individual; and provided further, that such individual may nevertheless apply for a new exemption with each change of address or residence.

J. Duty to Disclose Disqualification. Any service user who has been exempt under this section shall notify the collector within ten days of any change in fact or circumstance which might disqualify the individual from receiving the exemption. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the benefits of the exemption provided by this section when the basis for such exemption does not exist or ceases to exist.

Any service supplier, who determines by any means that a new or nonexempt service user is receiving service through a meter or connection exempt by virtue of an exemption issued to a previous user or exempt user of the same meter or connection, shall immediately notify the collector of such fact and the collector shall conduct an investigation to ascertain whether or not the provisions of this section have been complied with, and where appropriate order the service supplier to commence collecting the tax from the nonexempt service user.

K. Audit by Collector. The collector shall have the power and right to demand evidence of continued eligibility of a service user for exemption under the provisions of this section. Such evidence may include, but need not be limited to, copies of business records, letters or statements from the Social Security Administration and state, county, city and private pension administrators or unemployment and welfare agencies, and such other evidence concerning the service user or other members of his household as may tend to prove or disprove such eligibility. Failure to provide such evidence as is within the control of a service user to so provide, either directly by him or by his consent or the consent of a member of his household, when such evidence is requested of the service user in writing by the collector shall be grounds for the immediate discontinuance of the service user’s eligibility for exemption under the provisions of this section. Evidence provided to the collector at his request, or voluntarily provided to him by the service user without the collector’s request, may not be used against such service user as evidence of violation of the provisions of this section. Such evidence may only be used as grounds for termination of the exemption provided for in this section.

L. Further Exemptions. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon any person if the imposition of such tax upon that person would be in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the state. (Ord. 1042 § 2 (Att. B), 2017; Ord. 670 § 1, 1984; Ord. 642 § 1, 1983)


3.30.220 Severability.

If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter or any part hereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter or any part hereof. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase hereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional.

3.32.010 Authority.

The city council enacts this chapter in accordance with the authority granted to cities by Article XI, Section 7, of the California Constitution. (Ord. 973 § 1, 2008)


3.32.020 Title.

This chapter shall be known as the city of Seaside regional development impact fee ordinance. The term “city” as used herein shall refer to the city of Seaside. (Ord. 973 § 3, 2008)


3.32.030 Operative date.

“Operative date” means the sixty-first day following its adoption, or upon certification by the executive director of TAMC that the county and eight of the cities within the county have adopted by resolution or ordinance the regional development impact fee, whichever date is later. If the certification by the executive director of TAMC does not occur on or before December 31, 2008, this chapter shall be void and have no force or effect. (Ord. 973 § 4, 2008)


3.32.040 Findings.

A. The city council of the city of Seaside finds that future development within the county of Monterey to the year 2030 will result in degradation of traffic levels of service on the regional transportation system of streets, arterials, and highways.

B. The city council of the city of Seaside finds that failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system as new development is approved will increase congestion on the regional system, as documented in the Regional Development Impact Fee – Nexus Study Update (the “study”) approved by the board of the Transportation Agency of Monterey County (“TAMC”) on January 16, 2008. TAMC commissioned the study which looks at, among other matters, future development and the planned future road improvements needed to serve the new development.

C. The city council of the city of Seaside also finds and declares that the fair-share traffic impact fee to be levied upon new development pursuant to this chapter provides a mechanism to fund new developments’ share of regional transportation system improvements that are needed to mitigate congestion and related adverse impacts caused by the new development.

D. The city council of the city of Seaside finds that exactions from new development are necessary to provide a portion of the funding for the construction of the regional transportation improvements needed to accommodate traffic that will be generated by new development of land within the county.

E. The city council of the city of Seaside finds that the study has determined the extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the regional transportation system and that this chapter establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing the unfunded costs of transportation improvements necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by such development.

F. The city council of the city of Seaside finds there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the regional development impact fee to pay for the construction of the regional transportation improvement projects and the type of development for which the regional development impact fee is charged in that all new development in the county, both residential and nonresidential, will generate or contribute to the need for the regional transportation improvement projects in different degrees as further described in the study.

G. The city council of the city of Seaside finds that the cost estimates set forth in the TAMC 2007 Regional Development Impact Nexus Fee Study Update are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the transportation improvement projects, and the regional development impact fees expected to be generated by future development will not exceed the projected costs of constructing the transportation improvement projects.

H. The city council of the city of Seaside also finds that the fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall only be used to finance the regional transportation improvement projects. The county adopts this chapter with the expectation that a required minimum number of TAMC member governing bodies will also adopt the RDIF on a uniform basis and that the county and these other TAMC members will use the fees collected in a coordinated manner to provide for financing and construction of the regional transportation improvement projects.

I. The city council of the city of Seaside has reviewed and considered the certified Environmental Impact Report for the 2005 Monterey Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Plan and addendum thereto prepared by TAMC, the lead agency for the regional transportation impact fee for purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.).

J. The city council of the city of Seaside has authorized the execution and delivery of a joint powers agreement (“JPA”) establishing a regional development impact fee agency (“RDIF agency”) to coordinate the activities of the parties to the JPA in connection with the collection, transmittal and expenditure of regional development impact fees (as defined herein). (Ord. 973 § 5, 2008)


3.32.050 Terms and definitions.

As used in this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

“Applicant” means the person or entity applying for a tract map, parcel map, tentative subdivision map, conditional use permit, land use permit, building permit or other land use entitlement for a new development project and their successors and assigns.

“RDIF agency” refers to the Monterey County Regional Development Impact Fee Joint Powers Agency.

“Regional development impact fee,” or “the fee,” or “RDIF” refers to the fees approved by the governing boards of the county and other TAMC members on new development within their respective jurisdictions and transmitted to the RDIF agency as provided in the JPA. The project list for the regional development impact fee is in Exhibit “B” of the JPA.

“Regional transportation improvement projects,” or “projects,” refers to those public improvements required to mitigate the regional impacts of new development on the roads, highways and arterials within the county as specified in SMC 3.32.060. (Ord. 973 § 6, 2008)


3.32.060 Establishment of a regional development impact fee.

A. The regional development impact fee is hereby established in the amounts specified in a resolution to be adopted by the Monterey County board of supervisors for the purpose of paying for regional transportation improvement projects identified in Exhibit “B” of the JPA needed to meet increased demand created by traffic resulting from new development.

The revenues raised from the impact fee shall be remitted to the RDIF agency to be held, maintained, used and accounted for as required in Government Code Section 66006 of the Mitigation Fee Act in a coordinated fashion, as provided in the JPA.

B. The regional development impact fee shall be automatically adjusted as of July 1st of each year following the first year after the effective date of this chapter. The adjustment shall be calculated by TAMC as administrator of the RDIF agency, based on the increase or decrease in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area for the period ending December 31st of the preceding calendar year.

C. In addition to the automatic adjustment set forth above, TAMC may recommend to the county and other TAMC members that the regional development impact fee be increased to reflect revisions to the project list in the Monterey County regional transportation plan, program revenue, increases in land values over the inflationary increase, or other factors.

D. Except as provided in Government Code Sections 65961, 66474.2 and 66498.1 or as otherwise provided by state or federal law or the exemptions set forth in SMC 3.32.070, no tract map, parcel map, tentative subdivision map, conditional use permit, land use permit, building permit or other land use entitlement for a new development project shall be approved or issued unless payment of the fee is a condition of approval for any such entitlement. Prior to issuance of a building permit or at such other time as required by law, the county shall require the applicant to pay the fee.

E. Impact fees shall be imposed and collected by the county and, along with any interest earned on the fees while in the possession of the county, shall be transmitted by the county to the RDIF agency on the first day of each month for all fees collected during the prior month. The fees shall be placed by the RDIF agency in the regional transportation impact fee trust fund. All interest or other earnings of the fund shall be credited to the fund. (Ord. 1042 § 2 (Att. B), 2017; Ord. 973 § 7, 2008)


3.32.070 Exemptions.

In addition to any exemptions from the levy of development impact fees provided by law, including, as applicable, the levy of development impact fees which are the subject of a vested subdivision map, the following development projects are exempt from payment of the fee required by this chapter:

A. The reconstruction of any building so long as the reconstructed building both continues a use of the same category as the prior use and generates the same or fewer trips as the original building and reconstruction commences and so long as the permit for reconstruction is issued within one year from destruction of the building.

B. Development within the Fort Ord Reuse Agency (“FORA”) area that is subject to transportation improvement fees for transportation projects within the FORA plan area.

C. Development pursuant to a development agreement that was entered prior to the effective date of the joint powers agreement in accordance with the terms of the development agreement in effect prior to the effective date of the joint powers agreement. (Ord. 973 § 8, 2008)


3.32.080 Credits or reimbursements.

An applicant who constructs all or part of one of the transportation improvement projects may be eligible for a credit or reimbursement, as provided herein.

A. Credit or Reimbursement for Regional Transportation Impact Projects Funded by the RDIF. An applicant may be eligible for a credit to be applied against payment of the regional transportation impact fee if the applicant dedicates right-of-way for and/or constructs all or a part of one of the transportation improvement projects that is, at the time the applicant enters into an agreement with the county for construction of such project, included in the strategic expenditure plan of the projects to be funded.

An applicant may be eligible for a reimbursement if the cost of constructing such a transportation improvement project, or a part of such project, exceeds the amount of the regional transportation impact fee to be paid by the applicant. The amount of reimbursement shall equal the difference between the cost of constructing all or a part of the regional transportation improvement project and the regional development impact fee for the development project.

Reimbursement shall be from regional development impact fee revenues only, and the right to reimbursement shall be terminated ten years from the date the applicant entered into the agreement for construction of the project.

The amount of credit, or the credit and reimbursement together, shall be in an amount equal to the cost of the regional transportation improvement project or portion thereof, as calculated by the RDIF agency. The credit, or the credit and reimbursement together, shall be calculated at the time the applicant enters into an agreement for construction of the regional transportation improvement project. The credit shall be granted at the same time. Once calculated, the amount of reimbursement shall not increase for inflation nor shall it accrue interest.

B. Reimbursement for Projects Not Funded for Construction at the Time of Project Construction. If an applicant constructs all or a part of a transportation improvement project that is not, at the time the applicant enters into an agreement for construction of such project, included in the strategic expenditure plan as a project to be funded, the developer may be eligible for reimbursement from the RDIF; provided, that the strategic expenditure plan is subsequently revised to include the improvement as a project to be funded.

In such event, the amount of reimbursement shall be calculated by the county public works director and approved by the RDIF agency for development located in unincorporated Monterey County and shall be equal to the cost of the project or portion thereof, as set forth in the strategic expenditure plan.

The amount of the reimbursement shall be calculated when the applicant enters into an agreement for construction of the transportation improvement project. Once calculated, the amount of reimbursement shall not increase for inflation nor shall it accrue interest. Reimbursement shall be from regional development impact fee revenues only, and the right to reimbursement shall be terminated ten years from the date the developer entered into the agreement for construction of the project.

“Gross receipts” means the total amount of the sale price of all sales and the total amount charged or received for the performance of any act, service or employment of whatever nature it may be for which a charge is made or credit allowed, whether or not such act, service or employment is done as a part of or in connection with the sale of materials, goods, wares, or merchandise. Included in gross receipts shall be all receipts, cash, credits and property of any kind or nature, and any amount for which credit is allowed by the seller to the purchaser without any deduction therefrom an account of the cost of the property sold, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs, interest paid or payable, or losses or other expenses whatsoever. Excluded from gross receipts shall be cash discounts allowed and taken on sales, any tax required by law to be included in or added to the purchase price and collected from the consumer or purchaser, and such part of the sale price of the property returned by purchasers upon recision of the contract of sale as is refunded either in cash or by credit.

“Marijuana” means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, oil, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds or resin.

5.04.020 Revenue measure.

The ordinance codified in this chapter is enacted solely to raise revenue for municipal purposes and is not intended for regulation; nor is the licensing of any business, trade or calling under this chapter to be construed as authorizing or sanctioning any departure or failure to comply with licensing provisions of the state or the United States of America, or any other applicable local, state or federal law.

This section shall not apply to inspection fees. (Ord. 599 § 2, 1982; prior code § 3-303)


5.04.040 Effect of ordinance on past actions and obligations previously accrued.

Neither the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter nor its superseding of any portion of any other ordinance of the city shall in any manner be construed to affect prosecution for violation of any ordinance committed prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, nor be construed as a violation, nor be construed to affect the validity of any bond or cash deposit required by any ordinance to be posted, filed or deposited, and any and all rights and obligations thereunto appertaining shall continue in full force and effect.

The city further requires all applicants who qualify as “contractors,” as defined in Business and Professions Code Section 7026 et seq., to provide the city with a signed statement that such applicant is licensed under the provisions of the Business and Professions Code Section 7065 et seq., and that the license is in full force and effect, or, if such applicant is exempt from provisions of Business and Professions Code Section 7065 et seq., he shall furnish proof of the facts which entitle him to such exemption. (Ord. 599 § 2, 1982; prior code § 3-305)

(Ord. 599 § 2, 1982; prior code § 3-306)

5.08.010 Findings.

The city council makes the following findings regarding the establishment of adult-oriented businesses:

A. Certain uses of real property, variously described as adult bookstores, adult motion picture facilities, figure model studios, adult cabarets, adult motels, escort services and massage parlors, have serious objectionable characteristics which, if such uses were allowed to become concentrated in certain areas of the city, may have adverse effects upon the character of such areas and adjacent neighborhoods;

B. Permitting the concentration of such adult-oriented businesses in residential zones, or in zones adjacent to schools, churches or public recreational areas, or within close proximity of such uses, may expose minors to such facilities and this may adversely affect such minors due to their immaturity;

C. Special regulation of adult-oriented business uses is necessary to ensure that such uses do not become incompatible land uses and, further, will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of zones in which they are permitted, therefore, adversely affecting property values and deterring or interfering with the development and operation of other businesses within the city;

D. There is a higher incidence of crime, especially crimes against the person, in areas in which adult-oriented businesses are permitted to cluster or become concentrated, and that such crimes and the incidence thereof increase in the late evening and night hours, requiring increased effort on the part of public safety personnel to police such activities, with resultant costs to the city. (Ord. 1042 § 2 (Att. C), 2017; Ord. 937 Att. 1, 2004)

5.20.010 Findings and purpose.

The council finds that the public is making increasing use of security alarm systems, and the police are called to respond to such alarms with greater frequency. The majority of the alarms activated and responded to turn out to be false. False alarms impose a financial burden on the city and, by demanding fast police response, cause substantial risk both to police personnel and the public. It is therefore necessary to regulate the use of security alarm systems in the city and to establish service charges to be assessed in the event of false alarms. (Ord. 676 § 2, 1985)


5.20.020 Definitions.

The following definitions shall govern the construction of this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires.

“Audible alarm” means an alarm system which, when activated, generates an audible sound on the premises.

“False alarm” means an alarm signal, either silent or audible, prompting a response to be made by the police or fire department, when an emergency situation for which the alarm system was intended does not exist.

“Person” means and includes, but is not limited to, a natural person, firm, partnership, association, corporation or other business.

“Security alarm system” means any mechanical or electrical device which is designated or used for the detection of an unauthorized entry into a building, structure or facility, or for alerting others of the commission of an unlawful act within a building, structure or facility, and which is designed or used so as to transmit, when activated, a sound, signal or message which is audible, visible or perceptible outside of the protected building, structure or facility. “Security alarm system” includes a system installed on residential as well as on commercial property. “Security alarm system” shall also include alarm systems which are designed or used for the detection of fire, smoke, gas, failure of fire suppression equipment or other fire-related hazards. The following devices are not included within the definition of “security alarm system”:

1. Auxiliary devices installed by the telephone company to protect telephone company systems which might be damaged or disrupted by the use of an alarm system;

2. Audible alarms affixed to motor vehicles.

“Silent alarm” means an alarm system which, when activated, transmits a signal to a monitor at a predesignated place other than the location where the alarm has been installed.

“Subscriber” means a person who owns or leases property or premises on which a security alarm system has been installed or is proposed to be installed or who contracts or proposes to contract with an alarm business for the leasing, servicing or maintaining of a security alarm system, and who has or will have authority to cause the security alarm system to be serviced, repaired or removed after the system is installed.

“Written notice” means a written notice, given by personal service or by the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the person to be notified at his or her last known address. Service of such notice shall be effective upon the completion of personal service, or upon the placing of the notice into the custody of the United States Postal Service.

Should property owner notify the state franchise holder of objection to placement of any such above ground or underground installations (excluding aerial cable lines utilizing existing poles and existing cable paths), the state franchise holder shall confer with the city public works department regarding appropriate location and placement of such appurtenances.

10. In addition to any other notice of proposed entry required under this subsection E, a state franchise holder’s personnel shall make a reasonable attempt to give personal notice to residents immediately preceding entry on private property or public ways or public easements adjacent to or on such private property.

F. Emergency Alert.

1. Emergency Alert Systems. Each state franchise holder shall comply with the emergency alert system requirements of the Federal Communications Commission in order that emergency messages may be distributed over the state franchise holder’s network.

2. To the extent consistent with California Public Utilities Code Section 5880, each state franchisee shall provide the system capability to transmit an emergency alert signal to all participating subscribers, in the form of an emergency override capability to permit the city to interrupt and cablecast an audio message on all channels simultaneously in the event of a disaster or public emergency. Each state franchisee shall be exempt from all liability for the use of the emergency alert, and the city shall indemnify and hold each state franchisee harmless from any claims and damages arising out of any such use.

G. Public, Educational, and Government Access Channel Capacity, Interconnection, Signal Carriage and Support.

1. PEG Channel Capacity.

a. A state franchisee that has been authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission to provide video service in the city shall designate and activate three PEG channels within three months from the date that the city requests that the state franchisee designate and activate these PEG channels. However, this three-month period shall be tolled for such a period, and only for such a period, during which the state franchisee’s ability to designate or provide such PEG capacity is technically infeasible, as set forth in Sections 5870(a), 5870(c) and 5870(h) of the California Public Utilities Code.

b. A state franchisee shall provide an additional PEG channel when the standards set forth in Section 5870(d) of the California Public Utilities Code are satisfied by the city or any entity designated by the city to manage one or more of the PEG channels.

2. PEG Support.

a. Amount of PEG Support Fee. Any state franchise holder operating within the city shall pay to the city or, if directed by the city, pay to the city’s designated PEG provider a PEG support fee equal to one percent of gross revenues.

Each payment made shall be accompanied by a report, detailing how the PEG support fee was calculated.

d. If a state franchisee fails to pay the PEG support fee when due, or underpays the proper amount due, the state franchisee shall pay a late payment charge at the rate per year equal to the highest prime lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus one percent, to the extent that such a late payment charge is deemed to be consistent with DIVCA.

3. PEG Carriage and Interconnection.

a. As set forth in Sections 5870(b) and 5870(g)(3) of the California Public Utilities Code, state franchisees shall ensure that all PEG channels are receivable by all subscribers, whether they receive digital or analog service, or a combination thereof, without the need for any equipment other than that needed to receive the lowest cost tier of service. PEG access capacity provided by a state franchisee shall be of similar quality and functionality to that offered by commercial channels, shall be capable of carrying a National Television System Committee (NTSC) quality television signal, and shall be carried on the state franchisee’s lowest cost tier of service. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited by federal law. After the initial designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without the agreement of the city unless federal law requires the change.

b. As set forth in Section 5870(h) of the California Public Utilities Code, the holder of a state franchise and an incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG programming. If a state franchisee and an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement for PEG carriage, the city shall require the incumbent cable operator to allow the state franchise to interconnect its network with the incumbent cable operator’s network at a technically feasible point on the state franchisee’s network as identified by the state franchisee. If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available, the state franchisee shall make interconnection available to each PEG channel originator programming a channel in the city and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the state franchisee requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

H. Notices.

1. Each state franchise holder or applicant for a state franchise shall file with the city a copy of all applications or notices that the state franchise holder or applicant is required to file with the California Public Utilities Commission.

2. Unless otherwise specified in this section, all notices or other documentation that a state franchise holder is required to provide to the city under this section or the California Public Utilities Code shall be provided to both the city manager and the city staff person in charge of cable and telecommunications, or their successors or designees.

If an expedited hearing is requested, the regional taxi authority shall endeavor to set an earlier date for the hearing but is not required to set an earlier date.

The hearing shall comply with the applicable provisions for the protection of the due process rights of the taxicab driver and the taxicab driver will be given the opportunity to be heard.

The regional taxi authority may, but is not required to, issue a temporary permit, as set forth below, which will allow the taxicab driver to temporarily operate until such time as the regional taxi authority board of directors has issued a final decision. In order to issue such a permit, the regional taxi authority must, in addition to the requirements set forth below, make findings that the public safety and health will not be harmed by the issuance of a temporary driver’s permit and unusual circumstances exist which require the issuance of a temporary driver’s permit.

H. Temporary Permits. The regional taxi authority, in its sole discretion, may grant a temporary permit to drive or operate any taxicab, pending final action on any application for a permanent taxicab driver’s permit as provided in this chapter, but no such temporary permit may be issued to any person who does not have a valid driver’s license issued by the state, who is not employed or possessing a written offer of employment as a taxicab driver in the city, or who has not provided evidence of negative controlled substance and alcohol testing as required by SMC 5.64.240.

Requirements for rehabilitation and return-to-duty and follow-up testing and other requirements, except as provided otherwise in this section, shall be substantially as set forth in Part 382 (commencing with Section 382.101) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

C. A test in one jurisdiction shall be accepted as meeting the same requirement in the city or in any other jurisdiction. Any negative test result shall be accepted for one year as meeting a requirement for periodic permit renewal testing or any other periodic testing in the city or any other jurisdiction, if the driver has not tested positive subsequent to a negative result. However, an earlier negative result shall not be accepted as meeting the preemployment testing requirement for any subsequent employment, or any testing requirements under the program other than periodic testing.

D. In the case of a self-employed independent driver, the test results shall be reported directly to the regional taxi authority, and the authority shall notify the taxicab leasing company of record, if any, of positive results. In all other cases, the results shall be reported directly to the driver’s employer, who shall immediately notify the authority of the results.

E. All tests are confidential and shall not be released without the consent of the driver, except as authorized or required by law.

F. Self-employed independent drivers shall be responsible for compliance with, and shall pay all costs of, this program with regard to themselves. In all other cases, taxicab owners and employers of drivers shall be responsible for compliance with, and shall pay all costs of, this program with respect to their employees and potential employees, except that an employer may require employees who test positive to pay the costs of rehabilitation and of return-to-duty and follow-up testing.

G. Taxicab owners, employers of drivers, and self-employed independent drivers shall pay all service charges, fees, or assessments established by the regional taxi authority with respect to the owner’s employees and potential employees in an amount sufficient to pay for the authority’s costs of carrying out the mandates of this section.

H. No evidence derived from a positive test result pursuant to the program shall be admissible in a criminal prosecution concerning unlawful possession, sale or distribution of controlled substances.

I. For purposes of this section, “employment” includes self-employment as an independent driver or owner/operator of a taxicab. (Ord. 989 § 2, 2010)

It shall be the duty of each person operating a taxicab, and the driver thereof, to keep the taximeter therein operating at all times within the accuracy and requirements of this chapter and such additional requirements as may be prescribed from time to time by the regional taxi authority.

E. Use Required for All Passenger Services. No passenger shall be carried in any taxicab for hire unless the taximeter in such taxicab is in operation. This section shall apply regardless of whether the taxicab is engaged for a trip entirely within the regional taxi authority area or partially outside thereof, and such meter shall be kept operating continuously during the entire time that it is engaged in the transportation of passengers for compensation, regardless of the point of destination; except, that when the trip is in excess of fifteen miles a flat rate may be used for any part of the trip over the first fifteen miles.

F. All Charges to Be in Accordance with Meters. All charges for taxicab service shall be calculated and indicated by a taximeter, except as described in this chapter, and at all times while the taxicab is engaged the “flag” of the taximeter shall be thrown into a position to register charges for mileage and time. No taximeter shall be so operated as to cause any charge to be registered thereon, except during the time while the taxicab is engaged by a passenger.

G. Splitting of Fares by Two or More Passengers. If two or more persons going in the same direction share a taxicab, the first party that is discharged from the taxicab shall pay the charge on the meter, and the meter shall then be “flagged” and a new fare started; except and unless, if the driver agrees at the inception of the hire to drop the first fare without “reflagging” and starting a new fare.

H. Proper Use of “Flag” Required. No driver of any taxicab, while carrying passengers, shall display the “flag” attached to the taximeter in such a position as to denote that such vehicle is not employed, or fail to throw the “flag” of the taximeter to a position indicating such vehicle is unemployed at the termination of each service.

5.70.010 Legislative findings and determination.

The city council finds and determines that:

A. The operations of radio-dispatched tow truck services that, on a contract basis, make periodic patrols of the parking facilities of large apartment and multifamily residential complexes to locate and tow away or impound illegally or improperly parked motor vehicles, while providing a useful service to the property owners or lessees in question and/or their apartment managers, have resulted in numerous complaints to the city from residents concerning the methods employed and the substantial fees charged, and have led to an inordinate number of public disturbances and serious altercations requiring the response of city police officers.

B. Many of the citizen complaints received by the city council at the several public hearings held concerning this matter have indicated that many of the problems from these contract-patrol tow truck operations have been caused in large by:

1. The general lack of adequate notice or warning concerning parking regulations and the serious consequences of violation to vehicle drivers who may park in improper places;

2. The lack of personal involvement from the apartment owners or managers in connection with the vehicle impoundment so as to preclude any input concerning pertinent facts or variable situations which might affect the impound process;

3. The apparent swiftness of the entire impoundment procedure which often results in the towing of vehicles parked improperly for only very brief periods; and

4. Effective process to dispute the towing of a vehicle, but only the remedy of an immediate large cash payment to retrieve one’s vehicle to avoid an actual towing at considerable additional expense.

C. Prior to the commencement of such contract-patrol towing operations in the city, the police department had received few, if any, complaints concerning the towing of motor vehicles from private property. (Ord. 664 § 1 (Exh. A), 1984)


5.70.020 Legislative purpose and intent.

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to exercise the general police power of the city to provide for the orderly regulation of the business of tow truck operators that, pursuant to contract, patrol private parking facilities to impound and tow away illegally or improperly parked vehicles by establishing certain minimum standards for the conduct of such businesses to protect the public safety and welfare of the residents of the city.

5.74.020    Definitions.


5.74.005 Findings and purposes.

A. When the city has a financial or proprietary interest in a project that includes hospitality operations such as hotels, including restaurants, bars, clubs, and food and beverage operations that are located within the hotel or hotel complex, and when the revenues generated by such operations are necessary to defray the public costs incurred in the construction or maintenance of such projects, or when such revenues are necessary to fund lease, rental or license payments to the city, it is essential to the public fiscal welfare that the revenue stream to so defray or fund not be interrupted or in any manner be affected by labor disputes.

B. The city has found that the effective way to avoid such disputes is to require employers and others receiving public funding or revenue to be signatory to a collective bargaining agreement or a labor peace agreement with unions representing or seeking to represent employees who will staff the hospitality operations described hereinabove. A collective bargaining agreement generally prohibits a union and all employees covered by such an agreement from engaging in picketing, work stoppages, boycotts or other economic interference with the business of the employers, for the duration of the collective bargaining agreement, and provides instead for arbitration of all employment disputes arising under the collective bargaining agreement. A labor peace agreement allows a union to organize a property through a card check with the employer taking a neutral stance toward the card check process in exchange for which the union agrees to forbear picketing, work stoppages, boycotts or other economic interference with the business of the employers for the duration of the labor peace agreement and to provide instead for arbitration only for any disputes relating to the interpretation of the labor peace agreement.

C. It is the purpose of this chapter to require a collective bargaining or labor peace agreement, as described above, to ensure continuous provision of employee services and consequent assurance that the city will continue to receive agreed upon revenue to defray financial obligations and to fund public services. (Ord. 933 (Exh. A § 1), 2004)


5.74.010 Labor activity pledges required.

A. All contractors shall be or become signatory to a collective bargaining agreement or a labor peace agreement with any labor organization representing or seeking to represent hospitality workers employed in contractor’s hospitality operations in a capital project or under a revenue producing contract as a condition precedent to its contract or subcontract with city.

B. Each collective bargaining agreement shall include a provision prohibiting the labor organization and its members from engaging in any picketing, work stoppages, boycotts or any other economic interference with the hospitality operations of contractor for the duration of the collective bargaining agreement. Each collective bargaining agreement must provide that, during the term of the agreement, all disputes relating to the collective bargaining agreement shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration. A labor peace agreement shall include a provision requiring the union to forbear picketing, work stoppages, boycotts or other economic interference with the business of the employers for the duration of the labor peace agreement. This agreement shall also provide for arbitration only for any disputes relating to the interpretation of the labor peace agreement.

C. All contractors shall require that any work under contract or contracts with city to be done by contractors’ contractors, subcontractors, tenants or subtenants, licensees or sublicensees shall be done under labor peace agreements or collective bargaining agreements containing the same provisions as specified above in this section.

D. A contractor shall be relieved of the obligations of this section with respect to a labor organization if the labor organization places conditions upon its strike and/or labor activity pledge that the council finds, after notice and hearing, to be arbitrary or capricious, or for other good and sufficient reasons. (Ord. 933 (Exh. A § 2), 2004; Ord. 922 § 2, 2004)

If the property is found to be vacant or shows evidence of vacancy, it is deemed abandoned under this chapter and the responsible party/beneficiary shall, within ten days of the inspection, register the property.

Registration may be accomplished by either of the following methods:

A. By completing and returning to the building official or his/her designee a city-provided registration form with the required fee; or

B. By registering with a city-approved national database that contains the information set out below and which service the city may access at no cost.

Nothing in this section shall prohibit the use of both methods of registration.

From time to time, the building official may approve an acceptable national database(s) which shall be identified in writing and which shall be posted in the resource management services department and on the city’s website.

If the property is occupied but remains in default it shall be inspected by the responsible party/beneficiary, or their designee, monthly until (1) the trustor or another party remedies the default, or (2) it is deemed abandoned.

Property subject to this section shall remain under the registration requirement, security and maintenance standards of this chapter as long as the property remains abandoned. It is the obligation of the responsible party/beneficiary/owner to inform the city of any pending action, such as a bankruptcy, other court or administrative action that would prohibit the responsible party/beneficiary/owner from taking any of the actions required in this chapter.

The property shall be maintained free of graffiti, tagging or similar markings by removal or painting over with an exterior grade paint that matches the color of the exterior of the structure.

Insofar as there is existing or previously existing landscaping, all visible yard areas shall be maintained to the neighborhood standard at the time registration was required.

Landscaping includes, but is not limited to, grass, turf stain, ground covers, bushes, shrubs, hedges or similar plantings, decorative rock or bark or artificial turf designed specifically for residential installation.

Pools, hot tubs and spas shall be kept in working order so the water remains clear and free of pollutants and debris or drained and kept dry. In either case, properties with pools or spas must comply with the minimum security fencing requirements of the state of California.

Adherence to this section does not relieve the beneficiary/responsible party of any obligation set forth in any covenant, condition and restriction or any homeowners’ association rule or regulation which may apply to the property. (Ord. 996 § 1, 2011)


8.29.060 Security requirements.

Property subject to this chapter shall be maintained in a secure manner so as not to be accessible to unauthorized persons.

Secure manner includes, but is not limited to, the closure and locking of windows, doors (walk-through, sliding or garage), gates or any other opening of such size that leave it accessible.

The responsible party/beneficiary or their designee shall perform monthly inspections to verify that the requirements of this section are being met.

If the responsible party/beneficiary does not have a property-preservation or real estate owned section/department, a field service provider or property manager shall be contracted to perform the inspection verifying compliance with the requirements of this section and that all other applicable laws are being met.

The property shall be posted with name and twenty-four-hour toll-free contact telephone number of the beneficiary or property preservation, real estate owned section/department, field service provider or property manager. The posting shall be no less than eight and one-half inches by eleven inches and shall contain, along with the name and twenty-four-hour toll-free contact number, the words “THIS PROPERTY MANAGED BY” and “TO REPORT PROBLEMS OR CONCERNS CALL” or similar such language in both English and Spanish.

8.29.070 Additional authority.

In addition to the enforcement remedies established in any other chapter of this code, the building official or his or her designee shall have the authority to require the responsible party/beneficiary of any property affected by this chapter to implement additional maintenance or security measures including but not limited to securing any/all doors, windows or other openings, installing additional security lighting, increasing on-site inspection frequency, employment of an on-site security guard or other measures as may be reasonably required to arrest the decline of the property. (Ord. 996 § 1, 2011)

Should any provision, section, paragraph, sentence or word of this chapter be determined or declared invalid by any final court action in a court of competent jurisdiction or by reason of any preemptive legislation, the remaining provisions, sections, paragraphs, sentences or words of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect.

(Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)


8.32.050 Exception – Safe and sane fireworks.

The sale, display for sale, and use of safe and sane fireworks shall be permitted only during that period beginning at twelve noon on June 28th and ending at ten p.m. July 5th of that same year. It shall be unlawful for any person to sell safe and sane fireworks within the city of Seaside without having first applied for and received a permit from the city as required under this chapter. (Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)


8.32.060 Permit to sell safe and sane fireworks – Application – Qualified applicants.

A. All eligible nonprofit organizations interested in displaying for sale and in selling safe and sane fireworks must meet all requirements of this chapter and must submit an application to the city in a manner determined by the city manager or his/her designee. All applications for permits to display for sale and to sell safe and sane fireworks shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the city’s fire chief or his/her designee on forms supplied by the city. Any eligible nonprofit organization which demonstrates compliance with all applicable requirements and conditions of this chapter shall be deemed a qualified applicant.

B. An interested eligible nonprofit organization may submit to the city an application for a permit to sell beginning March 1st of each year, or the first business day thereafter, and ending the last business day in April of that same year.

C. No organization shall submit more than one application. Submittal of more than one application by any organization or an affiliated organization thereof shall be grounds for denial of all applications. The city manager shall have final authority to determine the affiliation of organizations.

D. Any attempt to transfer an application shall void any and all applications filed by or on behalf of both the transferor and the transferee.

E. Each application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee at an amount established by resolution of the city council. The application fee shall be in addition to any fee or tax imposed by any other chapter of the Seaside Municipal Code. (Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)


8.32.070 Limitation on permits to sell safe and sane fireworks – Selection of eligible nonprofit organizations.

A. Each calendar year, the city shall issue, at the sole discretion of the city council, up to a maximum number of permits not to exceed thirteen. One permit shall be issued to each eligible nonprofit organization selected pursuant to this section.

B. Of the maximum number of stands/permits allowable in any given year, there shall be two classes of stands/permits: grandfathered and lottery.

1. Grandfathered stands/permits are provided in recognition of the fact that some local service organizations have relied upon safe and sane fireworks sales as a primary source of income for many years.

2. Lottery stands/permits are provided in recognition of the fact that there are other local service organizations that could benefit from the sale of safe and sane fireworks, but are not as dependent upon this source of income.

Grandfathered permits may be established by city council resolution. Grandfathered organizations must reapply each year for a permit to sell safe and sane fireworks to retain their grandfathered status. Failure by a grandfathered organization to file complete permit application packets with the city by the required deadlines shall result in loss of their grandfathered status. Failure to abide by city policies and/or fireworks sales requirements, or by any other valid order or requirement issued by the fire department, may result in the disqualification for grandfathered status and will be grounds for the organization that previously held grandfathered status subject to the loss of such status.

The number of lottery stands/permits consists of the difference between the maximum number of stands/permits allowed under this ordinance and the number of valid grandfathered stand/permits issued in that year. The number of lottery stand/permits may increase if one or more grandfathered stand/permits are not applied for in accordance with the city requirements. Lottery stand/permits shall be granted by lottery drawing held by the city clerk no later than May 15th of each year. Organizations selected by a lottery shall be notified by the city clerk following the results of the drawing. Notice of lottery drawing date and location shall be provided by the city clerk by notice posted on the city’s website or placed in a daily newspaper having widespread circulation of the city of Seaside and by mail to those nonprofit organizations who have applied for a lottery stand/permit that year. Lottery stand/permits do not become grandfathered stand/permits that year. Lottery stand/permits do not become grandfathered stand/permits the following year. A holder of a lottery stand/permit in a particular year is not guaranteed the lottery stand/permit the following year.

C. Two or more eligible nonprofit organizations from the same priority category may jointly submit an application to the city pursuant to SMC 8.32.060 and may jointly receive a permit to sell fireworks pursuant to this chapter.

D. The city’s fire marshal or his/her designee shall issue permits to those eligible nonprofit organizations that have submitted a conforming and timely application. Selection shall be made at random from among all those eligible nonprofit organizations which have submitted conforming and timely applications. The fire chief or his/her designee shall notify selected organizations in writing no later than May 15th of each year.

E. Permits issued pursuant to this section are valid only during the calendar year issued.

F. Permits are not transferable to any other person or organization.

G. Prior to the issuance of a permit pursuant to this chapter, and in addition to those other requirements set forth in this chapter or on the permit application; in order for a permit to be issued, a qualified nonprofit organization shall demonstrate compliance with all of the following:

1. On a form provided by the city, set forth the proposed location of the fireworks stand; the name, address and telephone number of one or more responsible adults who will be in charge of and responsible for the fireworks stand during the period fireworks are sold, displayed or stored at such location; and written permission from the owner of record and/or lessor and/or management company of the property upon which said fireworks stand is proposed to be located;

2. A copy of the requisite retail sales permit issued by the office of the California State Fire Marshal;

3. Evidence of a temporary sales tax permit from the California State Board of Equalization;

4. Payment of the permit/license fee at the amount established by resolution of the city council;

5. Throughout the term of a permit issued pursuant to this chapter, each permittee shall pay for and maintain in full force and effect policies of insurance in a form and amount and with coverage types required by the city. The policies of insurance shall name the city, its officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds. (Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)


8.32.080 Operator safety seminar.

Each year, one or more representatives from each organization that is issued a permit to display for sale or to sell safe and sane fireworks shall attend a stand operator safety seminar conducted by the city of Seaside fire department and each of the fireworks wholesalers operating in Seaside that year. The failure of an organization to have a representative of the organization attend the seminar shall result in the revocation of the permit and the disallowance to display for sale or to sell safe and sane fireworks.

B. The assessment is intended to raise sufficient funds for the city to help pay for the cost of enforcement; inspection of stands; public education and awareness campaigns; enforcing the provisions of this chapter, including extra personnel time, and cleanup of the fireworks trash and debris left behind each year. “Extra personnel time” shall be defined as employee or contracted employee time that the city would not otherwise incur but for the sale and use of safe and sane fireworks. By the first regular city council meeting in May of each year, the city manager must submit to the city council for its approval, a proposed budget for police, fire, administrative services and public works departments. The exact amount of the assessment shall be determined each year by no later than the second regular city council meeting in May of that year and notice sent to each of the permittees. In no event shall the assessment be more than seven percent of the gross sales of the fireworks sold in the city that year. The fireworks wholesaler with whom each permittee has contracted shall be responsible for collecting the estimated assessment from their nonprofit organizations, advising the city of the amount of each estimated assessment collected, and holding the funds in trust pending notification by the city of the exact amount owed. After the city determines each permittee’s share of the total annual sales volume, each permittee shall be billed for its share of the total assessment. A duplicate copy of each permittee’s invoice will be sent to its fireworks wholesaler. Payment of the assessment by each permittee shall be due to the city thirty days after the issuance of the invoice. The expenses submitted are subject to review, audit and dispute by any permittee who has to pay the assessment that year. Any dispute of the assessment must be filed within fifteen days of its receipt or any right to contest it will be deemed waived. The city council is the final arbiter of any disputed assessment. Any excess (i.e., difference between amount of surcharge collected by each group and the amount of their individual assessment) shall remain the property of that permittee.

C. Failure by any permittee to pay the amount assessed to it by the city shall be cause to bar the permitee from selling safe and sane fireworks in the future, until the assessment is paid in full. Furthermore, if the assessment is not paid by the due date, it shall be subject to a ten percent penalty for each month or portion of a month that it is late. (Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)

The annual storage permit shall be annually renewable, subject to inspection clearance by the Seaside fire department. The fee for such permit shall be established by resolution of the city council.

Nonpayment shall prohibit the permittee from obtaining permits for subsequent years until the invoice is paid in full. (Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)

At a minimum each public education plan shall consist of the distribution with each sale of safe and sane fireworks of two fireworks educational brochures prepared by the state fire marshal’s office, and not less than one thousand dollars worth of public service announcements broadcast on local television, and bearing the fireworks wholesaler’s name, on the safe and responsible use of safe and sane fireworks. Each public education plan should at least include samples of all the materials and the extent of distribution of all of the safety and education materials identified in that fireworks distributor or fireworks wholesaler’s public education plan. (Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)

C. The remedies set forth in this chapter are in addition to all other legal and equitable remedies, administrative, criminal or civil, that may be pursued by the city to address violations of this chapter including, as an alternative to the issuance of an administrative fine pursuant to this section, and in his or her sole discretion, the city attorney may criminally prosecute a violation of this chapter.

D. The imposition of administrative fines under this section related to the use, possession, sale, or display for sale of dangerous fireworks shall be limited to persons who possess, sell, use, and/or display, or the seizure of, less than twenty-five pounds of dangerous fireworks measured by gross weight. Any person or entity who possesses, uses, stores, sells, and/or displays less than twenty-five pounds of dangerous fireworks are subject to an administrative fine, together with all costs of enforcement, of not less than one thousand dollars for each such offense.

E. Administrative fines collected pursuant to this section and related to dangerous fireworks shall not be subject to the restrictions of California Health and Safety Code Sections 12500 through 12759; however, the city shall provide cost reimbursement to the state fire marshal pursuant to regulations adopted by the state fire marshal addressing the state fire marshal’s cost for the transportation and disposal of dangerous fireworks seized by the city, which costs will be part of any administrative fine imposed. Unless and until said regulations have been adopted, the city shall hold in trust two hundred fifty dollars, or twenty-five percent of administrative fines collected, to cover the cost reimbursement to the state fire marshal for the cost of transportation and disposal of the dangerous fireworks.

F. Because of the serious threat of fire or injury posed by the use of “dangerous fireworks” that can result from persistent or repeated failures to comply with the provisions of this code and the effect of such conditions or activities on the safety and the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties and to the public health, safety and welfare, this chapter imposes strict civil liability upon the owners of residential real property for all violations of this code existing on their residential real property. Each contiguous use, display and/or possession shall constitute a separate violation and shall be subject to a separate administrative fine. (Ord. 1014 § 2, 2014)

BMP requirements may incorporate by reference best management practices promulgated by federal, state of California, or regional agencies. Where best management practices requirements are promulgated in the BMP Guidance Series, each person who discharges pollutants to the storm drain system or water of the U.S., and each person owning or operating any facility that may cause such a discharge, shall comply with those BMP requirements. The city engineer will periodically report to the city council on the status of implementation of BMPs and any new BMPs to be developed for inclusion in the BMP Guidance Series.

B. Responsibility to Implement Best Management Practices. Notwithstanding the presence or absence of BMP requirements promulgated pursuant to subsections A, B, C, and D of this section, each person engaged in activities or operations, or owning facilities or property which will or may result in pollutants entering storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. shall implement best management practices to the extent they are technologically achievable to prevent and reduce such pollutants. The owner or operator of each commercial or industrial establishment shall provide reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the city storm drain system and/or watercourses. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes shall be provided and maintained at expense of the owner or operator.

C. Construction Sites. The city shall require appropriate best management practices to reduce pollutants in any storm water runoff from construction activities. The city shall incorporate such requirements in any land use entitlement and construction or building-related permit to be issued relative to such development or redevelopment. The owner and developer shall comply with the terms, provisions, and conditions of such land use entitlements and building permits as required in this chapter, the city storm water utility ordinance, and the city’s NPDES permit. Construction activities subject to BMP requirements shall continuously employ measures to control waste such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste at the construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality, contamination, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.

D. New Development and Redevelopment. The city shall require appropriate best management practices (BMP) to control the volume, rate, and potential pollutant load of storm water runoff from new development and redevelopment projects as required by the city’s NPDES permit to minimize the generation, transport and discharge of pollutants. The city shall incorporate such requirements in any land use entitlement and construction or building-related permit to be issued relative to such development or redevelopment. The owner and developer shall comply with the terms, provisions, and conditions of such land use entitlements and building permits as required in this chapter and the city’s NPDES permit as it may be amended from time to time. These requirements may include a combination of structural and nonstructural BMPs, and may include requirements to ensure the proper long-term operation and maintenance of these BMPs, including inspections and right of entry by city staff or agent to ensure compliance with the requirements of this article or to enforce any provision of this article.

8.46.140 Requirement to eliminate illegal discharges.

Notwithstanding the requirements of SMC 8.46.190, the city engineer may require by written notice that a person responsible for an illegal discharge immediately, or by a specified date, discontinue the discharge and, if necessary, take measures to eliminate the source of the discharge to prevent the occurrence of future illegal discharges. (Ord. 959 § 2 (Exh. A), 2007)


8.46.150 Requirement to eliminate or secure approval for illicit connections.

A. The city engineer shall require by written notice that a person responsible for an illicit connection to the storm drain system comply with the requirements of this chapter to eliminate or secure approval for the connection by a specified date, regardless of whether or not the connection or discharges to it had been established or approved prior to the effective date of this chapter.

B. If, subsequent to eliminating a connection found to be in violation of this chapter, the responsible person can demonstrate that an illegal discharge will no longer occur, said person may request city approval to reconnect. The reconnection or reinstallation of the connection shall be at the responsible person’s expense. (Ord. 959 § 2 (Exh. A), 2007)


8.46.160 Requirement to protect watercourses.

Every person owning or leasing property through which a watercourse passes shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property reasonably free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. The owner or lessee shall not remove healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually necessary for maintenance, nor remove said vegetation in such a manner as to increase the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The property owner and lessee shall be responsible for maintaining and stabilizing that portion of the watercourse that is within their property lines in order to protect against erosion and degradation of the watercourse originating or contributed from their property.

8.54.010 Findings and declaration of intent.

The city council finds that trees, both individually and in clusters, contribute to the attractiveness and livability of the city. Aesthetically, trees provide scale, color, silhouette and mass. Trees also provide shade, moisture and wind control, and protect natural resources by providing erosion control for the soil, oxygen for the air and a habitat for wildlife. Trees sustain and enhance property values, and reduce the cost of drainage systems for surface water. Trees provide screens and buffers to separate land uses, are landmarks of the city’s history, and a critical element of nature in the midst of urban settlement. For these reasons, the council finds that in order to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the city, while at the same time recognizing individual rights to develop private property in a manner which will not be prejudiced to the public interest, it is necessary to enact regulations controlling the planting, removal, protection and preservation of trees within the city. (Ord. 871 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997; Ord. 706 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986)

B. If the proposed work is to be done in connection with the remodeling or improving of a structure, or with new construction or development, for which city approval is required, the information required under subsection A of this section shall be provided to the city as part of the application process referred to in SMC 8.54.060.

C. The director of public works, or his designee, shall inspect the tree and the side, or the site, of the proposed planting and shall consider the following factors in deciding whether to issue or deny the permit:

1. The condition of the tree with respect to disease, general health, damage, public nuisance, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures, interference with utility services or public improvements, age or remaining life span, and whether or not the tree acts as host for a plant which is parasitic to other species of trees which are in danger of being infested or exterminated by the parasite.

2. The necessity of the requested action to construct improvements, or allow economic or other enjoyment of the property.

3. The topography of the land and the effect of the requested action on erosion, soil retention, water retention, and diversion or increased flow of surface waters.

Such report shall be sent to the board of architectural review, where applicable, or to the individual or body responsible for approving the applicant’s site plans.

C. The board of architectural review, or other reviewing body, shall endeavor to preserve all trees recommended for preservation. The following finding must be made if it is determined that any of the trees recommended for preservation should be removed due to special site, grading or any unusual characteristics associated with the property proposed for the development:

1. The preservation of the tree(s) would significantly preclude the feasible development of the property;

2. Final approval in connection with construction or development, or tentative approval of a map, or approval of final plans indicating any trees to be removed shall constitute a permit to remove or alter any trees so designated.

D. No tree may be removed or altered on any undeveloped parcel on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays, or any time except during regular working hours (eight a.m. to five p.m.) Monday through Friday. (Ord. 871 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997; Ord. 706 § 2 (Exh. A), 1986)

Chapter 8.60 ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE FOOD PACKAGING

Sections:

8.60.010    Findings and declaration of intent.

8.60.012    Definitions.

8.60.014    Prohibited disposable food service ware.

8.60.016    Required biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable disposable food service ware.

8.60.018    Exemptions for biodegradable, compostable or recyclable food service ware.

8.60.020    Enforcement and notice of violation.

8.60.022    Penalties and fines for violations.


8.60.010 Findings and declaration of intent.

The city finds and declares that:

A. The city borders the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a federal preserve that supports one of the most diverse and delicate ecosystems in the world. This sanctuary provides habitat for at least thirty-three mammals, ninety-four species of seabirds, three hundred forty-five species of fish, and contains the largest kelp forest in the nation. The impact of an environmentally damaged Monterey Bay or the pollution of our rivers and lakes would be felt area wide.

B. Food and beverage packaging constitutes a significant and growing portion of the waste in the city. Laws, policies and regulations pertaining to disposable food service ware is a component in the city’s efforts to reduce the amount of disposed waste.

C. Food service ware made from polystyrene foam is not biodegradable, returnable, or practically recyclable. Polystyrene foam breaks into smaller pieces and, because it is lightweight, may be picked up by the wind even when it has been placed in a waste receptacle.

D. A prevalence of polystyrene foam packaging, which is highly durable and persists longer than any other type of refuse, litters parks and public places, streets and roads, waterways, storm drains and beaches. This litter ultimately floats or is blown into the Monterey Bay, adversely impacting our environment.

E. Mistaking it for food, marine animals and birds often ingest polystyrene foam, which can damage their digestive tracts, often leading to death.

F. Polystyrene foam is manufactured from petroleum, a nonrenewable resource.

G. Scientific evidence indicates that styrene leaches from polystyrene foam containers into food and drink. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that there are short- and long-term adverse health effects associated with exposure to styrene.

H. It is not economically feasible at this time to recycle polystyrene foam in or near the city. When products are recycled, natural resources are conserved, less energy is used for the production of new products, and valuable landfill space is preserved. When biodegradable products are turned into compost they can reduce water use and reduce the need for chemical fertilizer. Takeout food packaging that is biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable is the most responsible and sustainable choice for the tourist economy, the citizenry and the environment.

I. Biodegradable takeout packaging (such as cups, plates, clamshell containers and cutlery) made from paper, sugarcane, corn byproducts and potato starch is available locally. As these products degrade, they do not harm the environment and are not a permanent blight on the landscape.

J. Eliminating the use of polystyrene foam and other nonbiodegradable, noncompostable, nonreturnable and nonrecyclable food packaging material from all establishments within the city will help protect the local environment, including the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, from contamination and degradation, helping to safeguard this area as a tourist destination and a safe and healthy living community. It will also support the city’s goal of reducing waste and protecting the environment for generations to come.

K. Taking the aforementioned action also will be cost-effective, helping to maximize the operating life of landfills and reducing the economic and environmental expense of managing waste and litter. (Ord. 985 (Exh. A), 2010)


8.60.012 Definitions.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, whenever used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

A. All food providers within the city utilizing disposable food service ware shall use biodegradable, compostable or recyclable products, unless there is no affordable alternative available as determined by the designated official (see definition of “Affordable” and SMC 8.60.018, exemptions). Food providers may charge a “takeout fee” to cover the difference in cost.

B. All city facilities utilizing disposable food service ware shall use products that are biodegradable, compostable or recyclable.

C. City contractors and special events promoters utilizing disposable food service ware shall use biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable products while performing under a city contract or permit. (Ord. 985 (Exh. A), 2010)

Backflow prevention devices must be tested at least annually and immediately after installation, relocation or repair. The city may require a more frequent testing schedule if it is determined to be necessary. No device shall be placed back in service unless it is functioning as required. A report in a form acceptable to the city shall be filed with the city each time a device is tested, relocated or repaired. These devices shall be serviced, overhauled or replaced whenever they are found to be defective and all costs of testing, repair and maintenance shall be borne by the water user.

B. The city will supply affected water users with a list of persons acceptable to the city to test backflow prevention devices. The city will notify affected customers by mail when annual testing of a device is needed and also supply users with the necessary forms which must be filled out each time a device is tested or repaired.

C. Upon request the city will test a water user’s backflow prevention device to fulfill the requirements of this chapter. The water user will be charged for the test and any maintenance found necessary to keep the device in working order on the next regular water bill. (Ord. 752 § 1 (Exh. A), 1988)


13.12.130 Backflow prevention device removal.

Approval must be obtained from the city before a backflow prevention device is removed, relocated or replaced.

A. Removal. The use of a device may be discontinued and the device removed from service upon presentation of sufficient evidence to the city to verify that a hazard no longer exists or is not likely to be created in the future.

B. Relocation. A device may be relocated following confirmation by the city that the relocation will continue to provide the required protection and satisfy installation requirements. A retest will be required following the relocation of the device.

C. Repair. A device may be removed for repair; provided the water use is either discontinued until repair is completed and the device is returned to service, or the service connection is equipped with other backflow protection approved by the city. A retest will be required following the repair of the device.

D. Replacement. A device may be removed and replaced; provided the water use is discontinued until the replacement device is installed. All replacement devices must be approved by the city and must be commensurate with the degree of hazard involved. (Ord. 752 § 1 (Exh. A), 1988)


13.12.140 User supervisor.

At each premises where it is necessary, in the opinion of the city, a user supervisor shall be designated by and at the expense of the water user. This user supervisor shall be responsible for the monitoring of the backflow prevention devices and for avoidance of cross-connections. In the event of contamination or pollution of the drinking water system due to a cross-connection on the premises, the city shall be promptly notified by the user supervisor so that appropriate measures may be taken to overcome the contamination. The water user shall inform the city of the user supervisor’s identity on, as a minimum, an annual basis and whenever a change occurs. (Ord. 752 § 1 (Exh. A), 1988)


13.12.150 Administrative procedures – Water system survey.

A. The city shall review all requests for new services to determine if backflow protection is needed. Plans and specifications must be submitted to the city upon request for review of possible cross-connection hazards as a condition of service for new service connections. If it is determined that a backflow prevention device is necessary to protect the public water system, the required device must be installed before service will be granted.

B. The city may require an on-premises inspection to evaluate cross-connection hazards. The city will transmit a written notice requesting an inspection appointment to each affected water user. Any water user who cannot or will not allow an on-premises inspection of his piping system shall be required to install the backflow prevention device the city considers necessary.

C. The city may, at its discretion, require a reinspection for cross-connection hazards of any premises to which it serves water. The city will transmit a written notice requesting an inspection appointment to each affected water user. Any water user who cannot or will not allow an on-premises inspection of his piping shall be required to install the backflow prevention device the city considers necessary. (Ord. 752 § 1 (Exh. A), 1988)


13.12.160 Customer notification.

A. Device Installation.

1. The city will notify the water user of the survey findings, listing the corrective actions to be taken if any are required. A period of sixty days will be given to complete all corrective actions required, including installation of backflow prevention devices.

2. A second notice will be sent to each water user who does not take the required corrective actions prescribed in the first notice within the sixty-day period allowed. The second notice will give the water user a two-week period to take the required corrective action. If no action is taken within the two-week period, the city may terminate water service to the affected water user until the required corrective actions are taken.

B. Testing and Maintenance.

1. The city will notify each affected water user when it is time for the backflow prevention device installed on their service connection to be tested. This written notice shall give the water user thirty days to have the device tested and supply the water user with the necessary form to be completed and resubmitted to the city.

2. A second notice shall be sent to each water user which does not have his/her backflow prevention device tested as prescribed in the first notice within the thirty-day period allowed. The second notice will give the water user a two-week period to have his/her backflow prevention device tested. If no action is taken within the two-week period, the city may terminate water service to the affected water user until the subject device is tested. (Ord. 752 § 1 (Exh. A), 1988)


13.12.170 Water service termination.

A. General. When the city encounters water uses that represent a clear and immediate hazard to the potable water supply that cannot be immediately abated, the city shall institute the procedure for discontinuing the city water service.

B. Basis for Termination. Conditions or water uses that create a basis for water service termination shall include, but are not limited to, the following items:

1. Refusal to install a required backflow prevention device;

2. Refusal to test a backflow prevention device;

3. Refusal to repair a faulty backflow prevention device;

4. Refusal to replace a faulty backflow prevention device;

5. Direct or indirect connection between the public water system and a sewer line;

6. Unprotected direct or indirect connection between the public water system and a system or equipment containing contaminants;

7. Unprotected direct or indirect connection between the public water system and an auxiliary water system;

8. A situation which presents an immediate health hazard to the public water system.

C. Water Service Termination Procedures.

1. For conditions designated in subsection (B)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section, the city will terminate service to a customer’s premises after two written notices have been sent specifying the corrective action needed and the time period in which it must be done. If no action is taken within the allowed time period, water service may be terminated.

2. For conditions designated in subsection (B)(5), (6), (7) or (8) of this section, the city will take the following steps:

a. Make reasonable effort to advise water user of intent to terminate water service;

b. Terminate water supply and lock service valve. The water service will remain inactive until correction of violations has been approved by the city. (Ord. 752 § 1 (Exh. A), 1988)

13.16.010 Findings and intent.

On April 24, 1989, the MRWPCA released the city’s final one-third allocation of housing units and sewer flow capacity. It is therefore appropriate to modify the restrictions on residential development imposed by Ordinances 730 and 748. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to maintain compliance with the allocation plans of the MRWPCA and the MPWMD as they affect residential and commercial development in the city. In order to ensure the availability of sewer connection permits for the future development of vacant legal lots of record, as well as to ensure an adequate supply of sewer and water for existing and future development, it is necessary for the public health, safety and welfare to regulate project approvals as provided in this chapter. (Ord. 759 § 1, 1989)


13.16.020 Residential subdivisions.

Notwithstanding any other ordinance, regulation or policy of the city, no application for a permit or other applicable entitlement for use which has as its result the approval or allowance of a residential subdivision in excess of four lots or otherwise results in the creation of more than four lots, shall be accepted, processed, acted upon, granted or approved by any employee, department or commission of the city. Applications for a permit or other discretionary entitlement for use that would result directly or indirectly in a residential subdivision in excess of four lots or the creation of more than four lots are exempt from the provisions of this section if filed with the city on or before May 5, 1989. (Ord. 759 § 2, 1989)


13.16.030 Authorization for residential sewer connection permits.

MRWPCA Ordinance 87-6 provides that the agency will issue sewer connection permits only with the prior written approval (preapproval) of the affected city. Pursuant to said provision, the city adopts the following regulations with reference to the preapproval of residential sewer connection permits.

A. Permitted Projects. With the exception of those applications for residential projects pending in the city as of May 5, 1989, only dwellings of four units or less may be granted preapproval authorization for the issuance of a sewer connection permit.

B. Procedure. Concurrent with the filing of an application for a residential project, or within ten days from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whichever date is later, the applicant may reserve with the community development department a preapproval for a sewer connection permit. Said preapproval reservation will be held for the applicant as follows: (1) For those residential projects requiring either a zoning or use permit, a reservation will be held for a period not to exceed ninety days; (2) For those residential projects which require extensive environmental review, and/or involve a proposed subdivision, a reservation will be held for a period not to exceed one year. Prior to the expiration of the above-stated time periods, the building official may grant an extension of time to the applicant upon a showing of good faith and factors beyond the control of the applicant.

C. Preapproval Authorization. Prior to obtaining city authorization (preapproval) for the issuance of a MRWPCA residential sewer connection permit, the applicant shall file a properly completed building permit application with the building division. If the building official finds that the work described in the building permit application and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to city standards and ordinances, and that the required fees have been paid, the official shall authorize issuance of the sewer connection permit. Following the issuance of a MRWPCA sewer connection permit, the city shall issue a building permit to the applicant.

D. Cancellation of Reservation. Failure to secure preapproval authorization or an extension thereto within the prescribed time shall result in the cancellation of said reservation.

E. Expiration of Building Permit. Within one hundred eighty days after the applicant has secured city preapproval, the applicant shall secure a MRWPCA sewer connection permit, a city building permit, and commence construction. Unless an extension has been granted as provided in subsection B of this section, applicant’s failure to secure the required permits and commence construction, and/or suspension or abandonment of the work once commenced, shall result in one or all of the following: (1) revocation of preapproval authorization, (2) cancellation of the MRWPCA sewer connection permit, (3) expiration of the building permit, which shall become null and void. (Ord. 759 § 3, 1989)


13.16.040 Requests for residential projects after exhaustion of allocation.

Requests for residential projects received after the MRWPCA housing units allocation is depleted, and/or requests for projects unable to be accommodated under the present allocation and pursuant to this chapter, including applications for multifamily dwellings in excess of four units and/or residential subdivisions creating in excess of four lots, shall be maintained by the community development department and applicants shall have the right to any future allocation of sewer capacity in the order received. (Ord. 759 § 4, 1989)


13.16.050 Water intensive uses.

A. Swimming Pools. No permit shall issue during the term of the ordinance codified in this chapter for the construction, installation, or enlargement of any swimming pool whether for public or private use.

B. Commercial Projects. With the exception of water intensive uses, as defined herein, applications for commercial projects shall be considered on a first come, first served basis within the limits of the city’s sewer allocation. No application for a permit, license or other entitlement for use which either directly or indirectly has as its result the approval or allowance of a commercial water intensive use shall be accepted, processed, acted upon or approved by an employee, department or commission of the city. As used herein, “commercial” means all uses permitted by the zoning ordinance, except residential uses. “Commercial water intensive uses” includes laundromats, restaurants, bars, and other commercial uses with a yearly water use factor, as defined by the WMD, greater than 0.0003 acre feet per square feet of building area. (Ord. 759 § 5, 1989)


13.16.060 Expansion or rehabilitation of existing commercial uses.

No application for a permit, license or other entitlement for use which has as its result the approval or allowance of an expansion or rehabilitation of an existing commercial use shall be accepted, processed, acted upon or approved by any employee, department or commission of the city, if it is determined that said expansion or rehabilitation will increase the use of water on the site by more than twenty-five percent over that level of use of water existing prior to the expansion of rehabilitation. (Ord. 759 § 6, 1989)


13.16.070 Sewer intensive commercial projects.

No application for a permit, license or other entitlement for use which either directly or indirectly has as its result the approval or allowance of a commercial use which represents ten percent or more of the city’s total remaining commercial sewer flow allocation shall be accepted, processed, acted upon or approved by any employee, department or commission of the city. (Ord. 759 § 7, 1989)


13.16.080 Current remaining allocation.

Upon the issuance of each preapproval authorization for a MRWPCA commercial sewer connection permit, the community development department shall deduct the estimated sewer flow for the project from the allocation remaining. The amount of allocation remaining shall be public information. (Ord. 759 § 8, 1989)


13.16.090 Preapproval authorization – Commercial.

Preapproval authorization for a MRWPCA commercial sewer connection permit shall be in accordance with the provisions of SMC 13.16.030(C), entitled “Preapproval Authorization.” (Ord. 759 § 9, 1989)


13.16.100 Redevelopment agency projects.

Redevelopment projects undertaken pursuant to a development agreement between the redevelopment agency of the city and a redeveloper are exempt from the provisions of this chapter as they relate to commercial development. (Ord. 759 § 10, 1989)


13.16.110 Determinations and appeals.

All determinations of sewer flow and water usage required under this chapter shall be made by the community development department using the same facts, figures, estimates and assumptions as those used by the MRWPCA and MPWMD in allocating sewer capacity and water in the city. Any applicant may appeal said determination by filing a written appeal within ten days after notice of the determination by the community development department. The chief of planning shall place said appeal on the planning commission agenda for hearing as soon as possible. Notice of said hearing shall be given to the applicant by mailing notice of the time and place of said hearing at least ten days before the hearing. No other notice need be given. (Ord. 759 § 11, 1989)


13.16.120 Exceptions.

Application of the strict terms of this chapter may be modified or waived when it is demonstrated that the intent and effect of the provisions hereof have been or shall be satisfied by use of equivalent measures or devices. (Ord. 759 § 12, 1989)

“Change of use” means, in the case of commercial, industrial or public authority structures, a change in the use to which the structure was previously devoted, to a substantially different use.

“Drip irrigation system” means any landscape irrigation system that disperses water in a controlled fashion to the extent necessary to provide sufficient water to sustain the growth of specific vegetation.

“Existing residential building” means any structure built and intended primarily for the shelter, or housing, of any person.

The building inspector of the city shall defer the retrofit requirement of this section for any plumbing fixture for which present technology is not available to cause the required flow reduction, such as in flushometer-style toilet fixtures, or where retrofitting is not otherwise practicable. (Ord. 725 § 1, 1987)

The transferor/seller shall submit proof of compliance to the building inspector, prior to obtaining a real property certification pursuant to Chapter 2.50 SMC.

2. The building inspector may waive the proof of retrofit before close of escrow requirement of this section where the seller and buyer certify that the structure will begin to be remodeled or modified within one hundred twenty days of the close of escrow, that the structure will be exclusively retrofitted with low water-use fixtures upon completion of construction, and the new owner shall allow inspection of the property by the city building inspector.

3. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any buyer or seller to instruct an escrow agent to close escrow for any sale of property in the city which does not comply with subsection (A)(1) of this section.

The owner(s) of the property, as revealed by the assessment roll, on which the violation is situated and any other person responsible for the violation shall be notified of the recordation, if their address is known to the building inspector or is otherwise reasonably available. The building inspector shall cause a notice of correction to be recorded at such time as the property owner has established full compliance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 725 § 1, 1987)


13.18.100 Discretionary exemptions.

The building inspector may, in his discretion, exempt facilities from the provisions of this chapter, or impose reasonable conditions in lieu of compliance therewith, if he determines that any of the following conditions exist:

A. The requirements herein would cause an unnecessary and undue hardship upon the owner or purchaser of the building or the public. Undue hardship may include:

1. Plumbing in an existing building or structure which does not match connections with low water-using plumbing fixtures and would, therefore, require partial replumbing of the building or structure, for example, different rough-in dimensions;

2. Unavailability of low water-using plumbing fixtures to match a well-defined historic architectural style (Victorian, Mission Revival), in an historic building (pre-1920);

B. The requirements in this chapter would create an emergency condition affecting the health, sanitation, fire protection or safety of the structure or the public;

C. The granting of the exemption or imposition of reasonable conditions in lieu of compliance with the requirements in this chapter would not increase the quantity of water consumed by the structure or otherwise adversely affect service to other existing water consumers. (Ord. 725 § 1, 1987)


13.18.110 Appeals.

A. Who May Appeal – Time for Appeal.

Chapter 13.24 WATER ALLOCATION PROGRAM

Sections:

13.24.010    Findings and declaration of intent.

13.24.020    Adoption of water allocation program.

13.24.030    Determinations.

13.24.040    Appeals.


13.24.010 Findings and declaration of intent.

Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (MPWMD) regulations allow for an intensification of water use. As a result, certain commercial and institutional projects which will result in an increase of water use continue to be eligible for permits from the MPWMD. The water used will be deducted from the city of Seaside’s current water allocation. All applications for permits must have written approval of the affected jurisdiction.

The potential for new water sources on the Monterey Peninsula are extremely limited and that demand for water in the city of Seaside may well exceed capacity within a very short period of time. As a result of the limited availability of water, the need for planned development, and the continuing number of applications for commercial and institutional projects, the city finds it necessary to develop criteria for evaluation of water allocation release requests for commercial and institutional properties. (Ord. 892 § 1, 2001)


13.24.020 Adoption of water allocation program.

Notwithstanding any other ordinance, rule, or policy of the city of Seaside, no application for a commercial or institutional project which would result in an increase in water use shall be accepted, processed, acted upon, granted, or approved by any officer or employee of the city of Seaside except in conformance with this water allocation program, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Exhibit “A” and incorporated herein by this reference thereto. Approval of the water allocation does not imply recommendations for or approval of any other applications which may be required for the project by the city of Seaside or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction over the project. Projects are required to obtain all other necessary approvals required by the city of Seaside and/or other governmental agencies. (Ord. 892 § 2, 2001)


13.24.030 Determinations.

All determinations of increased or intensified water usage required under this chapter shall be made by the committee referenced in Exhibit “A,” using the same facts, figures, estimates, and assumptions as those used by the MPWMD in evaluating and issuing permits. (Ord. 892 § 3, 2001)


13.24.040 Appeals.

An applicant may appeal a determination of water usage or the denial of a permit by filing a written appeal within ten days after notice of the determination or denial by the committee on a form prescribed for that purpose by the city of Seaside. All required plans, drawings, photos, reductions and other information shall be submitted to the planning division before the appeal form is accepted as complete. A list of required information shall be available in the planning division. The filing fee for an appeal shall be five hundred twelve dollars.

A complete appeal application shall be filed at least three weeks prior to the proposed date of public hearing. Upon filing a complete written appeal application and payment of fees, the community development director or his/her designee shall place said appeal on the agenda of the city of Seaside city council for hearing. Notice of said hearing shall be given to the applicant by mail at least ten days prior to the hearing date. No other notice need be given.

At the scheduled public hearing, the city council shall affirm, reverse or modify the decision being appealed. The city council may also remand the matter for reconsideration and further hearings because of a desire for additional information, or due to the submission of new material or evidence not previously considered. (Ord. 892 § 4, 2001)

B. Requirements. Rehabilitation financed in whole or in part by a Section 312 loan must comply with the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4801) and 24 C.F.R. Part 35, as amended. The LPA must ensure that immediate lead-based paint hazards are identified and treated as part of the required work under an approved Section 312 loan. Specifically, the applicable lead-based paint rules require:

1. That the treatment of identified immediate lead-based paint hazards in residential structures will be in accordance with 24 C.F.R. 35.24(b)(3);

2. That the LPA notify all owners and tenants of pre-1950 residential structures of the possible existence and potential hazards of lead-based paint poisoning, and of the precautions to be taken to avoid lead-based paint poisoning;

3. That the borrower’s agreement to comply with this section will be a condition of receiving a Section 312 loan. The locality is responsible for identifying and assuring the treatment of immediate lead-based paint hazards as part of the required work under an approved Section 312 loan.

C. Rehabilitation Contract – Lead-Based Paint Requirements. The LPA must require that all rehabilitation contracts and subcontracts between contractors and the borrowers, and all self-help agreements, include provisions for work necessary to eliminate existing lead-based paint hazards on applicable surfaces and for the prohibition of the use of lead-based paint on applicable surfaces, as required by the department’s final lead-based paint regulations. The construction contract between the contractor and the borrower or, if applicable, the self-help agreement between LPA and the borrower must contain the necessary provisions.

D. Information Available. Brochures on the hazards of lead-based paint and methods for eliminating such hazards are available from the HUD Field Office for distribution to applicants. (Ord. 796 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991)


15.08.200 Asbestos.

A. Applicable Statutes and Regulations. The applicable federal regulations are United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS); Asbestos Regulation (40 C.F.R. 61, Subpart M); and the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) Asbestos Regulations (29 C.F.R. 1910.1001). In addition, state and local authorities may have asbestos regulations and codes.

B. Requirements.

1. Federal.

a. OSHA. OSHA regulations apply to all private sector workplaces where there is an employee/employer relationship (for example, between a contractor and his workers), where asbestos is present.

b. USEPA. USEPA standards and NESHAPS regulations apply to all commercial, institutional and industrial structures, and residential properties of five or more units. EPC regulations and standards apply in two cases:

i. Renovation, where two hundred sixty linear feet of pipe wrap or one hundred sixty square feet of asbestos materials from other surfaces are to be removed from the premises; and

ii. Demolition, where any asbestos is to be removed. “Demolition” is defined as the wrecking or taking out of any load supporting structural member of a facility together with any related handling operations. In such cases, EPA must be notified immediately and removal regulations apply.

2. State and Local. States, counties and cities may also have asbestos regulations and codes. These codes may be different or more stringent than the federal regulations, and the LPA should also check with the various appropriate local and state authorities regarding rules and regulations relative to the identification and removal of such asbestos materials.

C. Identification of Asbestos and LPA Training. Asbestos is found frequently in older buildings which are to undergo rehabilitation. The LPA should provide training to its personnel in the identification and hazards of asbestos, and/or the LPA should obtain an independent inspection if asbestos is suspected. The cost of such and independent inspection is an eligible loan cost.

D. Notification to Borrowers. Where asbestos materials are identified by LPA personnel, or LPA personnel suspect the presence of asbestos materials, they should so notify the borrower and inform the borrower of the potential hazards, of the borrower’s responsibilities, and of the responsibilities of the contractor. Care should be taken that only qualified contractors experienced in asbestos removal be allowed to work on the project.

E. LPA Contract with OSHA and EPA. The LPA should contact the regional OSHA Office and the regional EPA Office for complete information regarding OSHA and EPA standards and regulations and requirements with regard to asbestos.

F. Information and Guidance. The Environmental Protection Agency publication, Guidance for Controlling Asbestos-Containing Materials in Buildings, contains the USEPA standards, NESHAPS regulations and OSHA regulations, and lists the regional NESHAPS contacts and regional asbestos coordinators. The document also contains a checklist for hiring experienced contractors, and contains information on asbestos. Copies are available from the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 20460. The OSHA publication, No. 3040, Health Hazards of Asbestos, provides a summary of OSHA regulations and requirements. The EPA publication, Asbestos Fact Book, is a useful booklet for public distribution. Copies can be secured from the Office of Public Affairs (A-107), Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 20460. Tel: (800) 424-9065 or (202) 554-1404. (Ord. 796 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991)


15.08.210 Accessibility standards.

A. Applicable Statutes and Regulations. The applicable statute and regulations are the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 and 24 C.F.R. Part 41).

B. Requirements. The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151) requires that certain buildings financed with federal funds be designed and constructed so as to be accessible to persons with disabilities. Since Section 312 loans are made only on privately owned properties, only nonresidential and the nonresidential portions of mixed-use properties assisted under Section 312 are directly subject to Architectural Barriers Act requirements.

C. Information. For further information contact the HUD Field Office Rehabilitation Management Specialist. (Ord. 1044 § 2 (Att. D), 2017; Ord. 796 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991)


15.08.220 Cost effective energy standards.

A. Applicable Statutes and Regulations. The applicable statutes and regulations are Section 312(i) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1964, as amended in 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1452b) and 24 C.F.R. 39, Cost Effective Energy Conservation and Efficiency Standards for Rehabilitation of Residential Properties (42 U.S.C. 1425b), et seq., Pub. L. 95-557.

B. Requirements. Residential rehabilitation work financed by a Section 312 loan must meet the cost effective energy conservation and efficiency standards. In determining the kind and extent of energy conservation measures required for any particular property or element, the LPA should, as a general rule, follow a common sense cost effectiveness approach. At a minimum, caulking and weatherstripping of all openings to the exterior must be accomplished. For mid-rise, high-rise and many low-rise multifamily projects, an energy audit must be carried out to identify and specify the energy and cost savings which are estimated to result from installing energy conservation measures. The energy audit can be completed by trained LPA staff or a private firm, in which case the fee for the service is an eligible loan cost.

C. Additional Information. The implementation of cost effective energy conservation and efficiency measures is discussed in detail in the publication entitled Applying the Cost Effective Energy Standards in Rehabilitation, Office of Urban Rehabilitation, Community Planning and Development, HUD. Copies are available from the Field Area Office. (Ord. 796 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991)


15.08.380 Smoke detectors.

All residential construction work which exceeds one thousand dollars, materials and labor, requires the installation of approved smoke detectors in each bedroom of the structure. (Ord. 823 § 2, 1993)

Article I. General Standards


15.10.010 Purpose.

A. The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings. Such buildings have been widely recognized for sustaining life-hazardous damage, including partial or complete collapse during moderate to strong earthquakes.

B. The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or injury. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated buildings. This chapter does not require analysis or alteration of existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire safety systems unless they constitute a hazard to life or property.

C. This chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings based on their present use. Priorities, time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed. (Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.020 Scope of chapter.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings which have been inspected by the building official and are presumed to have unreinforced masonry bearing walls, and/or present external hazards as defined herein. Said buildings are identified in Appendix A, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and kept on file in the office of the city clerk, and/or are the subject of an order by the building official issued pursuant to this chapter. This chapter shall not apply to detached one-family or two-family dwellings and detached multifamily dwellings containing less than five dwelling units and used solely for residential purposes. (Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.030 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the applicable definitions set forth in Sections 2302 and 2312 of the California Building Code, current edition (“CBC”), and the following definitions, shall apply:

“Building,” for the purpose of determining occupant load, means any contiguous or interconnected structure; for purposes of engineering valuation, means the entire structure or a portion thereof which will respond to seismic forces as a unit.

“Capacity for transfer” means the maximum allowable capacity of a structural system or connection to resist in a ductile manner the lateral forces it would encounter due to earthquake forces.

“Essential building” means any building housing a hospital or other medical facility having surgery or emergency treatment areas; fire or police stations; municipal government disaster operations and communication centers.

“External hazard” means an object attached to or forming the exterior facade of a building which may fall onto pedestrians or occupants of adjacent buildings. Examples of this type of hazard include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Nonstructural exterior wall panels, such as masonry infill or decorative precast concrete;

2. Parapets;

3. Marquees, awnings or other roof-like projections from a building;

4. Unreinforced concrete walls;

5. Masonry or stone wall veneer and wall ornamentation, including cornices or other decorative appendages;

6. Masonry chimneys;

7. Tile roofing;

8. Wall signs and exterior lighting fixtures hung from a building exterior;

9. Fire escapes or balconies.

“Geometry” means a building’s shape or configuration, including setbacks of wall/column lines, reentrant corners, discontinuities in vertical and horizontal lateral force diaphragms, open storefront and building stiffness variations due to the distribution of resisting elements or the use of materials of differing properties within the same structural element, or other irregularities in plan or elevation.

“High risk building” means any building, not classified as an essential building, having an occupant load of fifty or more, as determined by CBC Section 3302(a), or the building official, where applicable. Exceptions to this category shall include the following:

1. Any building having exterior walls braced with masonry crosswalls or wood frame crosswalls spaced less than forty feet apart in each story. Crosswalls shall be full story height with a minimum length one and one-half times the story height; or

2. Any building used for its intended purpose, as determined by the building official, for less than twenty hours per week.

“Historical building” means any building designated as a historical building by an appropriate federal, state or city jurisdiction.

“Low risk building” shall mean any building, not classified as an essential building, having an occupant load of fewer than ten occupants, as determined by CBC Section 3302(a), or the building official, where applicable.

“Medium risk building” shall mean any building, not classified as a high risk building or an essential building, having an occupant load of at least ten but fewer than fifty occupants, as determined by U.S.C. Section 3302(a), or the building official, where applicable.

“Occupant load” means the total occupant load of a building as determined by CBC Section 3302(a), or the actual maximum number of occupants in a building if that number is less than seventy-five percent of the number determined by reference to the CBC. The number of actual occupants may be documented by counting actual seating capacity if permanent seating is provided in the occupancy, or by employee and client counts which can be substantiated as a practical maximum use of the space in the building. The building official shall be responsible for determining occupancy loads.

“Solution” means any justifiable method that will provide for the transfer of lateral forces through a system or connection to a degree which will substantially eliminate a potential collapse failure. A general description of the methods and materials proposed to be used shall be included in sufficient detail to allow for a cost estimate of the solution to be made (i.e., adding shear walls, overlaying horizontal diaphragms, strengthening critical connections, etc.).

“Unreinforced masonry bearing wall” means any wall supporting a floor or roof where the total superimposed load exceeds one hundred pounds per linear foot and the area of reinforcing steel is less than fifty percent of that required by U.S.C. Section 2407(h), or any unreinforced masonry wall supporting its own weight when over six feet in height.

“Unreinforced masonry (URM) building” means any building containing walls constructed wholly or partially with any of the following materials:

1. Unreinforced brick masonry;

2. Unreinforced concrete masonry;

3. Hollow clay tile;

4. Adobe or unburned clay masonry;

5. External hazards. (Ord. 1044 § 2 (Att. D), 2017; Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.040 Rating classifications.

The rating classifications, Essential Building (I), High Risk Building (II), Medium Risk Building (III) and Low Risk Building (IV), as exhibited in Table No. 15.10-A, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and kept on file in the office of the city clerk, are hereby established, and each building within the scope of this chapter shall be placed in one such rating classification by the building official. The total occupant load of the entire building shall be used to determine the rating classification.

Exception: For the purposes of this chapter, portions of buildings constructed to act independently when resisting seismic forces may be placed in separate rating classifications. (Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.050 General requirements.

The owner of each building within the scope of this chapter shall cause a structural analysis to be made of the building by a licensed civil or structural engineer or architect licensed by the state, and shall be responsible for submitting said structural analysis to the building official in the form of an engineering report within two hundred seventy days after the service of an order. Such analysis, which shall be subject to approval by the building official, shall demonstrate that the building meets the minimum requirements of this chapter, or shall recommend an appropriate solution as specified in SMC 15.10.070. Adequate plans or drawings appropriate to the calculations shall be prepared and provided to the building official along with the engineering report. (Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.060 Administration.

A. Service of Order. The building official shall issue an order, as provided in subsection B of this section, to the owner of each URM building within sixty days after the effective date of this section. This order shall be final after the period allowed for objection if no such objection shall be filed, or on the date of final determination by the building official in the event a timely objection is filed.

B. Contents of Orders. The order of the building official shall be in writing and shall be served either personally or by certified or registered mail upon the owner, as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, or upon the person, if any, in apparent charge or control of the building. The order shall specify that the building has been determined by the building official to be an unreinforced masonry building subject to the provisions of this chapter. The order shall specify the rating classification of the building and shall be accompanied by a copy of this chapter.

C. Objection to Order. The owner or person in charge or control of the building may object to the building official’s initial determination that the building is within the scope of this chapter. Such objection shall be filed in writing with the building official within thirty days from the service date of the order and set forth the grounds for consideration. Any such objection shall be reviewed and decided by the building official within sixty days of its receipt.

D. Recordation and Posting. Once the order is final, the building official shall file with the office of the county recorder a certificate stating that the subject building is within the scope of this chapter. The certificate shall also state that the owner thereof has been ordered to structurally analyze the building. Notice shall also be posted on the premises in a form to be provided by the building official.

If the building is subsequently found not to be within the scope of this chapter, or as a result of structural alterations or an analysis is found to be structurally capable of resisting minimum seismic forces required by this chapter, or is demolished, the building official shall file with the office of the county recorder a certificate terminating the status of the subject building as being classified within the scope of this chapter.

E. Unoccupied Buildings. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or this code, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued to any unoccupied building or part thereof until the building official determines that the building is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.070 Structural analysis – Engineering reports.

A. General. Each building shall be evaluated on an individual basis without prejudice or comparison to similar type or age buildings which may have greater or lesser earthquake resistance. Generalities or stereotypes are to be avoided in the evaluation process by focusing on the specifics of the structural systems of the building in question and the local geology of the land on which the building is constructed.

B. Level of Investigation. Some buildings will require extensive testing and field investigation to uncover potential structural deficiencies while others will allow the same level of overall evaluation by a less complicated process due to simplicity of design or the availability of original or subsequent alteration design and construction documents. It is the responsibility of the engineer performing the evaluation to choose the appropriate level of investigation which will produce a report that is complete and can serve as a sound basis for a conclusion on the collapse hazard the building may present.

C. Format for the Report. The following is a basic outline of the format each engineering report should follow. This outline is not to be construed as a constraint on the professional preparing the report, but rather as a skeletal framework within which individual approaches to assembling the information required by this chapter may be accomplished. It also will serve as a means for the building official to evaluate the completeness of each report. No report shall be deemed complete without a recommendation addressing an appropriate solution to identified deficiencies. All reports shall be accompanied by adequate plans or drawings appropriate to the required calculations and recommendations.

1. General Information. A description of the building including: (a) the street address; (b) the type of occupancy use within the building, with separate uses that generate different occupant loads indicated on a plan showing the square footage of each different use; (c) plans and elevations showing the location, type and extent of lateral force resisting elements in the building (both horizontal and vertical elements); (d) a description of the construction materials used in the structural elements and information regarding their present condition; 

(e) the date of original construction, if known, and the date, if known, of any subsequent additions or substantial structural alterations of the building; and (f) the name and address of the original designer and contractor, if known, and the name and address of the designer and contractor, if known, for any subsequent additions or substantial structural alterations.

2. Investigation and Evaluation of Structural Systems. The report shall refer to the information contained in the URM Building Standards, on file in the building division, with respect to all items to be investigated and the methods of investigation for each type of building.

3. Test Reports. All field and laboratory test results shall be included in the report. Evaluation of the significance of these test results shall be made with regard to each structural system or typical connection being evaluated. This evaluation may be limited to a statement of the adequacy or inadequacy of the system or connection based on the lateral load demand it would be required to resist by calculation. If tests reveal inadequacy, a conceptual solution must be included in the report.

4. Conclusions. Based on the demand/capacity ratio and the specific evaluation items contained in the URM Building Standards, on file in the building division, a statement shall be provided explaining the overall significance of the deficiencies found to exist in the building’s lateral force resisting system regarding potential collapse or partial collapse failure.

5. Recommendations. An appropriate solution, which could be used to strengthen the structure to alleviate any collapse or partial collapse threat, shall be specified.

D. Exceptions and Alternatives. Exceptions to the specific items required to be included in an engineering report may be granted by the building official upon review of a written request from the engineer preparing the report. Such a request shall provide evidence that adequate information concerning the required item(s) can be determined by alternate means or that a conclusion can be made about the item(s) without following the solution called for in the appropriate section of this chapter. The purpose of granting such exceptions shall be to reduce the costs or disruption that would result from taking required actions, when it can be shown that they are unnecessary to provide information available by other equivalent means. In no case will an exception be granted which would result in an item not being completely evaluated. The decision of the building official in granting exceptions is final. (Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.080 Review of reports.

A. The building official shall utilize the services of civil or structural engineers to assist in determining if the submitted engineering reports conform to the requirements of this chapter.

B. The cost of this review shall be recovered by a fee paid by the building owner, based on the time required for the review. This fee amount shall be deducted from the plan checking fee collected for any future construction work that deals directly with correcting any of the structural inadequacies specified in the engineering report.

C. Copies of the engineering reports shall be available to interested individuals for a standard copying fee or may be reviewed at the building division office. (Ord. 772 § 1 (Exh. A), 1990)


15.10.090 Responsibilities of building owners – Notification of building tenants.

A building owner shall notify all tenants, in writing, that a structural investigation has been performed and that the report is available at the building division office.

For the purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases shall be construed as set forth in this section, unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended. A “structure” or “building” is any house or other building or structure erected or constructed or in existence prior to the moving hereinafter referred to. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-101)


15.12.020 Permit – Required.

No person shall move any building or structure, or a portion thereof, to any location thereof, to any location within the city from any location outside the city, or from one location to another within the city, unless and until the building department of the city has first issued to the owner of the premises to which the building is to be moved, a permit to relocate the particular building upon those premises. Such permit shall be called a “relocation permit.” (Ord. 171, 1959; Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-102)


15.12.030 Permit – Application – Contents.

A separate application must be made for each building or structure, or portion of a building or structure. No permit shall be issued until an application has been filed as provided in this chapter. Every application to the city council for a relocation permit shall be in writing upon a form furnished by the city clerk, and shall set forth such information as may reasonably be required in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, including the following:

A. A complete description of the building or structure to be moved;

H. Such other relevant information as the city council may require. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-104)


15.12.040 Permit – Application – Fee.

A. Before any application for a relocation permit is accepted, a fee in accordance with the fee schedule on file in the City Hall shall be paid by the applicant to cover the cost to the city of the investigation of the conditions of the building to be moved and the inspection of the proposed new site.

B. An additional fee of fifteen cents per mile for all mileage over twenty-five miles shall be added. This application fee shall be in addition to the regular building permit fee. No part of the application fee shall be refunded. (Ord. 334, 1968; Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-103)


15.12.050 Permit – Application – Approval or rejection – Appeal procedure.

The city clerk, immediately upon receipt of any such application, shall deliver the same to the building inspector, who shall have the duty to consider the application and approve or reject the same based upon the requirements of the municipal code. In the event the application is approved, it shall not be placed on the agenda of the city council. In the event the application is not approved and the permit required in this chapter is not issued, notice in writing shall be given to the applicant and the applicant shall have the right to appeal to the city council for the permit; provided, such appeal is made within ten days after denial or rejection by the building inspector. All standards to be used by the city council in consideration of such appeal, as set out elsewhere in this code, shall be used and applied by the building inspector in making his initial determination. (Ord. 171, 1959; Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-105)


15.12.060 Permit – Issuance.

No permit shall be issued to relocate any building or structure which is so constructed or in such condition as to be dangerous; or which is infested with pests or unsanitary; or which, if it is a dwelling or habitation, is so dilapidated, defective, unsightly or in such condition of deterioration or disrepair that its location at the proposed site would cause appreciable harm to or be materially detrimental to the property or improvements in the district within a radius of one thousand feet from the proposed site; or if the proposed use is prohibited by the zoning laws of the city; or if the structure is of a type prohibited, at the proposed location, by any fire district regulations, or by any other law or ordinance; provided, however, that if the condition of the building or structure, in the judgment of the city council, admits of practicable and effective repair, the permit may be issued upon condition as provided in SMC 15.12.080. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-106)


15.12.070 Permit – Denial.

If the unlawful, dangerous, or defective condition of the building or structure proposed to be relocated is such that remedy or correction cannot practicably and effectively be made, the permit shall be denied.

15.12.080 Permit – Issuance subject to conditions.

A. If the city council deems it necessary or expedient so to do, it may, in granting any relocation permit, impose thereon such terms and conditions as it may deem reasonable and proper, including, but not limited to, the requirement of changes, alterations, additions or repairs to be made to or upon the building or structure, to the end that the relocation thereof will not be materially detrimental or injurious to public safety or to public welfare or to the property and improvements, or either, in the district, as hereinabove limited, to which it is to be moved. The terms and conditions upon which each permit is granted shall be written upon the permit or appended in writing thereto.

B. The building inspector, in granting any relocation permit, shall permit the retention of existing materials and methods of construction so long as the building complies with the provisions published in the State Building Standards Code and other rules and regulations of the commission, and also complies with the building standards for foundation applicable to new construction. (Ord. 589 § II(32), 1981; Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-108)


15.12.090 Permit – Bond – Required.

No relocation permit shall be issued unless the applicant therefor shall first post with the city council a bond executed by the owner of the premises where the building or structure is to be located, as principal, and by surety company authorized to do business in the state, as surety. The bond, which shall be in form joint and several, shall name the city as obligee, and shall be in an amount equal to the cost, plus ten percent of the work required to be done in order to comply with all of the conditions of such relocation permit, as estimated by the building inspector. In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may post a bond executed by the owner, as principal, and which is secured by a deposit of cash in the amount named above and conditioned as required in the case of a surety bond; such a bond, as so secured, is hereinafter called a “cash bond” for the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-109)


15.12.100 Permit – Bond – Exceptions.

No bond, however, need be posted in any case where the city council determines that the only relocation involved is that of moving a building temporarily to the regularly occupied business premises of a housemover, or that of moving a building to adjacent property of the same owner; but the exceptions made in this chapter shall not apply unless the council further finds that no such security is necessary in order to assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 612 § 1 (Appx. A (35)), 1982; Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-110)


15.12.110 Permit – Bond – Conditions.

Every bond posted pursuant to this chapter shall be conditioned as follows:

B. That all of the work required to be done pursuant to the conditions of the relocation permit shall be fully performed and completed within the time limit specified in the relocation permit; or, if no time limit is specified, within ninety days after the date of its issuance. The time limit specified in this section, or the time limit specified in any permit, may be extended for good and sufficient cause by the city council. No such extension of time shall be valid unless written, and no such extension shall release any surety upon any bond. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-111)


15.12.120 Permit – Bond – Term – Completion.

The term of each bond posted pursuant to this chapter shall begin upon the date of the posting thereof and shall end upon the completion, to the satisfaction of the city council, of the performance of all the terms and conditions of the relocation permit. Such completion shall be evidenced by a statement thereof, signed by the building inspector, a copy of which will be sent to any surety or principal upon request. When a cash bond has been posted, the cash shall be returned to the depositor, or to his successors or assigns, upon the termination of the bond, except any portion thereof that may have been used or deducted as elsewhere in this chapter provided. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-116)


15.12.130 Permit – Default in performance – Notice.

Whenever the city council finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any term or condition of any permit, written notice thereof shall be given to the principal and to the surety of the bond. Such notice shall state the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of time deemed by the city council to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-112)


15.12.140 Permit – Default in performance – Duty of surety.

After receipt of such notice the surety must, within the time therein specified, either cause the required work to be performed or, failing therein, must pay over to the city council the estimated cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice, plus an additional equal to ten percent of said estimated cost. Upon the receipt of such moneys, the city council shall proceed, by such mode as it deems convenient, to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred therein other than for the expenditure of the sum in hand therefor. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-113)


15.12.150 Permit – Default in performance – Use of bond by city council.

If a cash bond has been posted, notice of default, as provided in SMC 15.12.130, shall be given to the principal and, if compliance is not had within the time specified, the city council shall proceed without delay, and without further notice of proceedings whatever, to use the cash deposit, or any portion of such deposit, to cause the required work to be done, by contract, or otherwise, in the discretion of the city council. The balance, if any, of such cash deposit shall, upon completion of the work, be returned to the depositor, or to his successors or assigns, after deducting the cost of the work plus ten percent thereof. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-114)


15.12.160 Permit – Default in performance – Option to complete structure or clear site.

When any default has occurred, on the part of the principal under the preceding provisions, the surety shall have the option, in lieu of completing the work required, to demolish the building or structure, and to clear, clean, and restore the site. If the surety fails to complete the work or demolish the building or structure and to clear, clean, and restore the site as provided in this section, the city council shall have the same option. (Ord. 53, 1955; prior code § 12-115)


15.12.170 Right of entry upon premises.

The city council, the surety, and the duly authorized representatives of either shall have access to the premises described in the relocation permit for the purpose of inspecting the progress of the work. In the event of any default in the performance of any term or condition of the relocation permit, the surety, or any person employed or engaged on its behalf, shall have the right to go upon the premises to complete the required work or to remove or demolish the building or structure. No person shall interfere with or obstruct the ingress to or from any such premises of any authorized representative or agent of any surety or of the city engaged in the work of completing, demolishing, or removing any building or structure for which a relocation permit has been issued, after a default has occurred in the performance of the terms or conditions thereof.

Projects which remove security devices or fail to maintain systems (including security guard services) required as a condition to the permit or approval shall have their permits or approvals revoked upon findings of such failure made by the planning commission after a public hearing held before them. (Ord. 765 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989)


15.24.090 Alternative materials and methods of construction.

The provisions of this chapter are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this chapter, provided any such alternate has been approved by the enforcing authority as affording the same measure of protection as those prescribed by this chapter. Nor is it the intention of this chapter to exclude any such method of structural design or analysis not specifically provided for in this chapter. (Ord. 765 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989)


15.24.100 Tests.

Whenever there is evidence of insufficient compliance with the provisions of this chapter or evidence that any material or any construction does not conform to the requirements of this chapter or where it is necessary in order to substantiate claims for alternate materials or methods of construction, the enforcing authority may require tests as proof of compliance to be made at the expense of the owner or owner’s agent by an approved agency. All tests will be made as set forth in the International Conference of Building Officials Reports and Underwriters Laboratories Publications. (Ord. 765 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989)


15.24.110 Enforcement.

The enforcement officer shall be the building official with the assistance of the authorized representative of the police department and other appropriate departments in accordance with administrative procedures adopted with the approval of the city manager. (Ord. 765 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989)


15.24.120 Responsibility for security in nonresidential buildings.

The person owning the property, his designated agent, tenant, and the general contractor for the project in question shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance with this chapter. Security items that will remain on the premises after a tenant moves out are typically the responsibility of the property owner; systems that are removed upon the vacating of the premises, such as an alarm system, are generally the responsibility of the tenant. (Ord. 765 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989)


15.24.130 Occupancy.

No persons shall occupy buildings or portions of buildings covered by this chapter until occupancy inspection and approval has been provided by the enforcing authority. (Ord. 765 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989)


15.24.140 Violation – Penalties.

Any person constructing, enlarging or maintaining any building or structure in this city or who causes the same to be done in violation of this chapter shall be guilty of an infraction. (Ord. 765 § 1 (Exh. A), 1989)


15.24.150 Nuisances declared – Abatement and injunctions.

Any building or structure set up, erected, constructed, altered, enlarged, converted, moved or maintained contrary to the provisions of this chapter is declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance, and in addition to any other remedy available, including criminal prosecution as an infraction, the city attorney shall immediately commence action for the abatement and removal and enjoinment thereof in the manner prescribed by law, and shall take such other steps and shall apply to such courts as may have jurisdiction to grant such relief as will abate and remove such building or structure, and restrain and enjoin any person, firm, or corporation from setting up, erecting, building, maintaining, or using any such building or structure contrary to the provisions of this title.

Article I. Purpose and Methods


15.28.010 Statutory authorization.

The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council ordains the provisions set out in this chapter. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 1.1)), 1988)


15.28.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 1.2)), 1988)


15.28.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A. To protect human life and health;

B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 1.3)), 1988)


15.28.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood-waters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 1.4)), 1988)

Article II. Definitions


15.28.050 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO, AH or VO zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident.

“Area of special flood-related erosion hazard” is the area subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area is designated as Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).

“Area of special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard” means and is the area subject to severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as Zone M on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).

Areas of Special Flood Hazard. See “Special flood hazard area.”

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “one-hundred-year flood”).

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

“Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic, or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood waters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

“Coastal high hazard area” means and is the area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as Zone V1 – V30 (VE or V).

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) the overflow of flood waters, (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any source, and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition.

“Flood Boundary and Floodway Map” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of flood hazard and the floodway.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the FIRM, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”).

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain management regulations” means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinances, grading ordinances and erosion control ordinances) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days.

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

“Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

“Sand dunes” means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area having special flood or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHEM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1 – 30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V1 – V3, VE or V.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include the installation of streets and/or walkways nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

“Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either:

1. Before the improvement or repair is started; or

2. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 2.0)), 1988)

Article III. General Provisions


15.28.060 Lands to which this chapter applies.

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 3.1)), 1988)


15.28.070 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

The areas of special flood hazard, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “Flood Insurance Study for the City of Seaside” dated August 19, 1988, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map and all subsequent revisions or updates to these documents, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This Flood Insurance Study is on file at City Hall, 440 Harcourt Avenue, Seaside, CA. This Flood Insurance Study is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city by the floodplain administrator. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 3.2)), 1988)


15.28.080 Compliance required.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 3.3)), 1988)


15.28.090 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 3.4)), 1988)


15.28.100 Interpretation.

In the interpretation of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 3.5)), 1988)


15.28.110 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 3.6)), 1988)

Article IV. Administration


15.28.120 Establishment of development permit.

A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards or areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) established in SMC 15.28.070.

4. Required within Zones AH, AO or VO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

C. Elevation and Flooding.

1. New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in subsection (C)(3) of this section. Upon the completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

2. New construction and substantial improvement of any structure in Zone AO or VO shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in subsection (C)(3) of this section. Upon the completion of the structure the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

3. Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance with subsection (C)(1) or (2) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:

a. Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the floodplain administrator.

4. Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

a. Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters; or

b. Be certified to comply with a local floodproofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 5.1)), 1988)


15.28.160 Standards for utilities.

A. All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from systems into flood waters.

B. Be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 5.4)), 1988)


15.28.190 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in SMC 15.28.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. (Ord. 744 § 2 (Exh. A (§ 5.5)), 1988)


15.28.200 Coastal high hazard areas.

Within coastal high hazard areas established in SMC 15.28.070, the following standards shall apply:

C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

E. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Monterey County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may file a cash bond or instrument of credit with the city engineer in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond. (Ord. 595 § 8, 1981)


15.32.140 Design standards – Cut and excavation.

A. General. Unless otherwise recommended in the soil engineering and/or engineering geology reports approved by the city engineer, cuts and excavations shall conform to the provisions of this section.

B. Slope. The slope of cut surface shall be no steeper than is safe for the intended use. Cut slopes shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and shall not exceed twenty feet in vertical height or exceed seventy-five feet slope (horizontal) distance without a bench or terrace break. Due to individual site soils and geology, flatter and shorter slope lengths may be required, or steeper and longer slope lengths may be allowed upon review by the city engineer when he finds this consistent with the building and safety. Cut slopes shall be rounded off so as to blend in with natural terrain (see Figure 2).


[IMAGE]


C. Stockpiles. Stockpile material for trenches and pits will be put upslope of the excavation to be promptly backfilled and compacted into trenches and pits. Excavated material not needed at the site will be removed or disposed of at a location approved by the city engineer.

D. Vegetative Protection. All earth cuts shall be planted or otherwise protected from the storm runoff erosion within thirty days of the completion of final erosion control and grading work. Planting shall be irrigated to establish a root system before the rainy season, if necessary in the opinion of the city engineer. (Ord. 595 § 9, 1981)


15.32.150 Design standards – Fill.

A. General. Unless otherwise recommended in the soil engineering and/or engineering geology reports approved by the city engineer, fill shall conform to the provisions of this section.

B. Fill Location. Fill shall not be constructed on natural slopes steeper than 2:1 unless an engineer devises a method of placement which will ensure the fill will remain in place. The toe of the fill shall be no closer than twelve feet horizontally to the top of existing or planned cut slopes. The area beyond the toe of the fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a drain shall be provided (see Figure 3).

C. Fill Slopes. The slope of fill surfaces can be no steeper than is safe for the intended use. Fill slopes shall be no steeper than 2:1 and shall not exceed twenty feet vertical height or seventy-five feet slope (horizontal) distance without a terrace break. Due to individual soil properties, shorter and flatter slopes may be required or steeper and longer slopes may be allowed upon review by the city engineer if he finds the deviations consistent with stability and safety. Fill slopes shall be rounded off so as to blend with the natural terrain (see Figure 3).


[IMAGE]


D. Ground Preparation. Natural ground surface over which fills are planned shall first be cleaned of all trash, vegetation, stumps, debris, noncomplying fill, top soil and other unsuitable materials and shall be scarified prior to the placement of the fill. Where slopes are 5:1 or steeper, a key, ten feet wide minimum, shall be dug into undisturbed, solid competent soil or bedrock beneath the toe of the proposed fill. The key must be cut and approved as a suitable foundation for fill before placing any fill (see Figures 1 and 3).

E. Materials Permitted. Only earth material free from tree stumps, detrimental amounts of organic matter, trash, garbage, sod, peat and/or similar materials shall be used. Rocks and/or broken concrete larger than six inches in greatest dimension shall not be used unless the method of placement is approved by the city engineer. Topsoil may be used in the top twelve-inch surface layer to aid in planting and landscaping.

F. Compaction of Fill. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum relative dry density of ninety-five percent as determined by ASTM D-1557-78 or CALTRANS test method under California 216. Field density verification must be submitted for any fill twelve inches or more in depth where such fill may support the foundation for a structure. A higher relative dry density and/or additional compaction tests may be required at any time by the city engineer.

G. Vegetative Protection. All earth fill shall be planted or otherwise protected from the effects of storm runoff within thirty days of the completion of final grading, and planting shall be irrigated to establish a root system, if necessary in the opinion of the city engineer. (Ord. 595 § 10, 1981)


15.32.160 Design standards – Cut and fill setbacks.

A. General. Unless otherwise recommended in the approved soil engineering and/or engineering geology reports and shown on the approved grading plan, setbacks shall conform to this section and be no less than as shown in Figure 4.


[IMAGE]


B. Minimum Setbacks. Tops and toes of cut and filled slopes shall be set back from property boundaries and structures as far as necessary for the safety of the adjacent properties and to prevent damage resulting from water runoff, by flooding, erosion of the slopes, or by sediment deposition (see Figure 4).

C. Stream and Riparian Setbacks. Tops and toes of cut and/or filled slopes shall be set back far enough to prevent encroachment upon streams, floodplains, channels, or bodies of standing water and to provide and maintain an undisturbed protective strip between the grading and the riparian corridor. This strip shall have sufficient filter capacity as determined by the city engineer to prevent degradation of water quality. If it is determined that the filter capacity of the protective strip is insufficient, additional erosion control may be required by increasing the width of the protective strip or with structural measures and/or by seeding, planting, mulching of bare soil areas.

D. Retaining Walls. Retaining walls, when keyed into stable foundations and capable of sustaining the design loads, may be used to reduce the required cut and fill setbacks when recommended by the civil or soil engineers, or geologist and approved by the city engineer. Other restrictions and/or minimums may be increased or related upon review by the city engineer if he finds the deviations consistent with safety and stability and to provide access for slope maintenance and drainageways. (Ord. 595 § 11, 1981)


15.32.170 Design standards – Drainage and terraces.

A. General. Drainage facilities and terraces shall conform to the provisions of this section unless otherwise indicated on the approved permit and plans. To the greatest extent possible, peak storm drainage runoff and sediment rates may not exceed predevelopment rates. A pro rata share of the cost of off-site erosion sediment, and flood control improvements and/or for maintenance to the principal drainageway, may be required by the city engineer to handle the increased peak runoff and/or sediment generated by the development if greater than predevelopment rates.

B. Runoff Calculations. Plans and specifications prepared for subdivisions, projects and/or developments, shall show, by table and/or calculations, the peak rates of storm runoff both before and after development. A combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff may be required.

C. Drainage Facilities.

1. Disturbance of natural drainageways shall be kept to a minimum and existing drainage courses shall not be obstructed or obliterated without mitigating measures installed that have been approved by the city engineer.

2. Whenever a grading operation obstructs or impairs the flow of runoff in an existing drainage course, a culvert, bridge or other suitable drainage facility designed and acceptable to the city engineer shall be installed to convey the flow past the point of impairment. No construction materials or construction byproducts shall be discarded in any drainageway or riparian zone.

3. Drainage facilities shall be culverts, pipe drains, paved, rock, or vegetative channels designed to safely carry existing and potential off-site runoff from a fully developed area upstream as well as local on-site surface and subsurface waters to the nearest adequate drainage course designated for such purposes by the city engineer. Properly designed energy dissipators are required at the point of discharge.

4. Culvert size and industry standard materials shall be used in accordance with city standard design criteria and as approved by the city engineer. Minimum diameter shall be twelve inches.

5. Cuts, fills, and retaining walls shall have subsurface drainage facilities as necessary for stability.

6. Berms, ditches, interceptor drains, or swales, may be constructed at the top of cut and fill slopes when necessary for protection against water runoff. Minimum size interceptor drains above cut slopes with a tributary drainage area greater than forty feet measured horizontally or an area larger than one-third acre shall be paved with three inches of reinforced concrete or gunite and shall be twelve inches deep with thirty-six-inch paved width and discharge into downdrain. Energy dissipators may be required by the city engineer.

7. At least a one percent grade will be required toward an improved storm drainage facility, either existing or planned, from all building sites, pads, yards, roof drains, driveways, etc.

8. Grading equipment shall not disturb or cross flowing streams unless absolutely necessary and only with prior approval from the city engineer.

D. Terraces.

1. Terraces at least six feet in width shall be established at not more than twenty-foot vertical intervals or seventy-five-foot slope horizontal intervals. Suitable access shall be provided to permit proper grading and maintenance of these terraces. Where only one terrace is required, it shall be at mid height (see Figure 4).

2. Swales or interceptor pipes or drains, ditches, on terraces and on the top of cut slopes, shall be designed to carry water and sediment to safe disposal structures and areas and shall have a minimum gradient of one percent and must be paved with concrete or gunite not less than three inches in thickness or other paved or vegetative approved nonerodible surface. They shall have a minimum depth of one foot and a minimum paved or protected area of five feet (see Figure 4). A revegetation and maintenance plan may be required by the city engineer. (Ord. 595 § 12, 1981)


15.32.180 Design standards – Erosion and sediment control.

A. General. Buildings and access envelopes shall be delineated on the development plans when necessary to keep disturbance out of particularly erodible areas. New lots shall not be created which will require access road and driveways to cross slopes exceeding fifty percent (2:1) for distances greater than fifty feet. Exposed soil shall be protected from erosion by temporary and/or permanent measures. Such protection may consist of mulching, plastic sheeting, and/or vegetation.

B. Slope. Structures on existing slopes exceeding thirty percent shall utilize pole, step or other such foundation that does not require major excavations or fillings (see Figure 3), unless otherwise approved by the city engineer.

C. Runoff Control. Where concentrated runoff will occur, it will be carried in pipe or culvert conduits or over a nonerodible surface (paved, rocked, or vegetated) with discharge points clearly shown on the development plans. All conduits must have proper energy dissipators at the point of discharge when necessary to prevent erosion.

D. Building Site Runoff. Runoff from buildings, roads, driveways and the total site area shall be controlled by berms, swales, ditches, structures, vegetative filter strips and/or catch basins to prevent the escape of sediment from the site.

E. Vegetative Removal. Development plans shall indicate the areas where vegetation is to be removed and replaced within the building and access envelopes. Vegetation removal shall be limited to that amount necessary and as indicated on the approved development plan. The method and time shall be such that the erosive effects are minimized.

F. Vegetative Disposal. Vegetation removed during clearing operations shall be disposed of by chipping, used as mulch, compost, and/or by burning. Burning shall comply with local air quality standards and no long branches or charred pieces shall be permitted to remain.

G. Topsoil. To promote regrowth of vegetation, the topsoil shall be stockpiled and reapplied upon completion of grading on slopes of less than 5:1 (twenty percent). Soil stockpiles and exposed soil shall be protected from erosion at all times.

H. Temporary Vegetation. Temporary vegetation sufficient to stabilize the soil as permanent vegetation cover is maturing shall be established on all disturbed areas as needed and as each stage of grade is completed.

I. Winter Operations. (October 15th to April 15th).

1. Land disturbance or development operations may be restricted or temporarily halted between October 15th and April 15th (the normal rainy season), and/or other times whenever the city engineer determines that the weather, soil, slope and general site conditions may cause serious accelerated erosion or sediment damage either on site or downstream. When work is allowed, native ground cover shall not be cleared, destroyed, burned or disturbed more than fifteen days prior to grading or construction work unless approved in advance by the city engineer.

2. When land development work is allowed during the normal, rainy winter season, adequate erosion and sediment control measures must be in place during any land disturbance, and temporary erosion control measures must be applied to all soils bared at the end of each day.

3. During winter, sufficient erosion control materials of straw, plastic, netting, etc., shall be kept on the site at all times to be installed immediately by the permittee upon advent of any rainfall or wind that may be expected to cause accelerated erosion.

4. All cut and fill slopes without established vegetation between October 15th and April 15th shall be mulched. The mulching shall be anchored by punching or tacking into the soil or by the use of netting. A minimum of one thousand pounds of straw, or equivalent, per each ten thousand square feet of slope surface will be required to be anchored. An additional amount may be required by the city engineer.

5. Within ten working days after seeding, fertilizing and/or mulching, the permittee will commence irrigation of the seeded areas or slopes and shall continue until the rains come and/or the ground cover is fully developed. Berms, diversion catch basins, etc., shall be installed prior to seeding and mulching.

6. All erosion control plantings and mulching shall be closely monitored throughout the winter and runoff problems corrected promptly. All erosion and/or slippage of banks shall be repaired by the permittee at his expense.

J. Dust. Dust from grading operations must be controlled. The permittee may be required to keep adequate equipment on the grading site to prevent dust problems.

K. Erosion Control Coordination with Project Installation.

1. All vegetative and/or structural measures required to safely discharge any accelerated runoff generated by the project shall be installed during the first or initial construction phase of the project.

2. Land shall be developed in increments of workable size which can be completed in a single construction season. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be coordinated with a sequence of grading, development, and construction operations and all necessary erosion control measures shall be put in effect prior to the commencement of the next work increment and/or winter rainy season.

3. Prior to completion and final acceptance of the project, all erosion control measures must be in place and all exposed bare soil shall be mulched, fertilized and otherwise prepared so that it is planted to a permanent vegetative cover. Native or naturalized vegetation should be used. The city engineer may require watering of planted areas to initiate and assure growth.

L. Livestock. Where necessary to assure that water quality is not affected by the keeping of livestock, vegetative buffer and/or filter strips shall be established on all downhill sides of areas where livestock are kept. The width of the buffer strip shall be determined by the city engineer. Also, additional erosion control measures, such as diversion, dissipators and sediment basins may be required to control runoff from these areas where livestock have destroyed and torn up protective vegetation.

M. Maintenance. All on-site erosion control facilities shall be properly maintained by the owners for the life of the project so that they do not become nuisances with stagnant water, heavy algae growth, insect breeding, odors, discarded debris, and/or safety hazards. Vegetative maintenance required may include mowing, fertilization, irrigation and/or reseeding. (Ord. 595 § 13, 1981)


15.32.190 Inspections and compliance required.

Excavation, grading, filling, clearing and erosion control work requiring a permit shall be subject to inspection by the city engineer. In lieu of inspection by city staff employees, the city engineer may require supervision, regular inspection, and special testing be performed and certified by the licensed professional who prepared the approved plan, or the city engineer may require supervision, inspection, and testing be done by an independent approved testing agency to ensure compliance with this chapter and the permittee’s permit conditions. (Ord. 595 § 14(1), 1981)


15.32.200 Required inspections.

The following inspections shall be required, but not limited to:

A. Presite inspection to determine the suitability of the proposed project and the existing and potential erosion and sediment hazards;

B. Periodic ongoing inspection during project progress, including compaction and special testing as may be required by the approved plan;

C. Final inspection determining compliance with terms and conditions of this chapter and permit. (Ord. 595 § 14(2), 1981)


15.32.210 Notification of city engineer by permittee.

The permittee shall notify the city engineer two working days prior to the beginning of the operation authorized by the permit, and one complete working day prior to any inspection or testing requested by the permittee. (Ord. 595 § 14(3), 1981)


15.32.220 Right of entry of city.

Filing of an application for a permit under this chapter constitutes a grant of permission for the city to enter the permit area for the purpose of administering this chapter from the date of the application to the termination of the erosion control maintenance period. If necessary, the city engineer shall be supplied with a key or lock combination, or permitted to install a city lock. (Ord. 595 § 14(4), 1981)


15.32.230 Conflict with other codes.

All previous codes are superseded by this chapter and repealed insofar as they conflict with this chapter. The city engineer shall have the authority to make interpretations of the sections of this chapter, and shall have the authority to determine which of the conflicting requirements shall govern.

15.34.010 Citation and authority.

The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted to establish a regulatory framework for subsequent agreements between the city of Seaside (“city”), the redevelopment agency of the city of Seaside (“city RDA”), the Fort Ord Reuse Authority (“FORA”) and the California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Toxic Substances Control (“DTSC”), related to digging and excavation on approximately one thousand five hundred eighty-one acres of the former Fort Ord military installation (“Fort Ord”) that are known or suspected to be contaminated with ordnance and explosives (“OE”) (Exhibit “A” attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter). This chapter may be cited as the “ordnance remediation district regulations of the city.” (Ord. 924 (Exh. A), 2004)


15.34.020 Purpose and intent.

The United States Army (“Army”) is in the process of transferring portions of the former Fort Ord to the city. Some parcels of the former Fort Ord were contaminated with OE, which is a hazardous waste. The Army will not transfer those parcels until it has cleared those parcels of OE to its standard. Even following the Army’s completion of OE response activities, it is possible that some OE materials may remain on those parcels. The DTSC has statutory responsibility to oversee cleanup of releases of hazardous substances, which includes hazardous waste. DTSC cannot certify that all OE has been cleared and it will require a land use covenant to be recorded with the Monterey County recorder on these parcels to provide additional controls and restrictions to protect the public health and safety. The city will also enter into an agreement with DTSC to provide additional safety measures, reporting, etc. (Ord. 924 (Exh. A), 2004)


15.34.030 General.

The city council finds and determines that those properties formerly included within the Fort Ord military installation which are suspected of containing OE require special standards and procedures for digging and excavation in addition to those contained in the Building and Construction Code, to ensure that:

A. Neither digging or excavation nor development of such properties occurs until ordnance or explosive remediation thereon is completed;

B. Potential purchasers or developers of sites which may contain OE and those persons whose work at such sites includes disturbing soil are aware of the potential that OE may be located on these properties and are aware of the requirements for OE precautions prior to any digging, excavation or ground disturbance thereon; and

C. DTSC should be continuously involved in the establishment of controls for those properties because it has statutory oversight responsibility with respect to hazardous substance response actions. (Ord. 924 (Exh. A), 2004)


15.34.040 Designation and applicability.

The city council, with the concurrence of DTSC, designates all real property within the city’s land use jurisdiction which was formerly part of Fort Ord and which has been identified in the archives search report and supplement, dated 1997, or otherwise identified, as the possible location of unexploded ordnance or explosives as an “ordnance remediation district” (“district”). Such district is depicted on the map included as Exhibit “A” to the ordinance codified in this chapter and includes all areas on the map that are within map legend designations “OE sites in Seaside” and “first tee boundary,” except those OE areas located within map legend designation “parcels retained by DOD.”

A. Such district shall be depicted on the city zoning map by an “ORD” suffix to indicate the existence of ordnance precaution remediation obligations on such property. The city shall notify DTSC of any change in the permitted land uses in the district within thirty days after it adopts any change.

B. The regulations in this chapter shall apply throughout the district and shall be in addition and subject to all provisions of the municipal code including SMC Title 17, Zoning, SMC Title 15, Buildings and Construction, and Chapter 15.32 SMC, Standards to Control Excavation, Grading, Clearing and Erosion. (Ord. 924 (Exh. A), 2004)


15.34.050 Excavation and digging restrictions.

b. Within forty days after receiving such an application, the city council shall hold a public hearing duly advertised following procedures set forth by this title to determine whether to grant a stay for up to five years or deny the requested stay.

B. Extensions. Upon written application of the subdivider filed not less than forty-five days prior to the expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map, the time at which such map expires may be extended by the city council for a period or periods not exceeding a total of two years. The chief of planning shall review the request and submit the application for extension, together with a report, to the city council for approval, conditional approval or denial. A copy of the chief of planning’s report shall be forwarded to the subdivider prior to the city council meeting on the extension. The city council shall specify the new expiration date of the tentative subdivision map. Consideration of the following shall be made in determining whether or not an extension should be granted:

1. Does the approved tentative map still comply with the zoning ordinance, general plan, and/or specific area plans?

2. Has the subdivider demonstrated significant progress in the conditions of approval?

3. Have there been significant changes whereby the tentative map will now have significant adverse effects on the neighborhood and/or community?

4. What is a reasonable period of time in which to complete the outstanding conditions of approval?

As a condition of the extension of the tentative subdivision map, the city council may impose new conditions or revise existing conditions on the approved tentative map as recommended by the chief of planning in his report or as the city council may find necessary. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. IV § 302(D)), 1983)

Chapter 16.20 SUBDIVISIONS – DESIGN STANDARDS

Sections:

16.20.010    Generally.

16.20.020    Energy conservation.

16.20.030    Access – Minor subdivisions.

16.20.040    Access – Tandem lot subdivisions.

16.20.050    Access – Major subdivisions.


16.20.010 Generally.

The design and layout of proposed lots in a tentative subdivision map shall comply with the requirements for lot size dimensions, densities, etc., as set forth in the Seaside zoning ordinance, general plan and/or specific area plans. Further, the location and provision of water hydrants and water mains and the provision and the design of primary and emergency access routes shall comply with the standards set forth in the current edition of the Uniform Fire Code. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. III § 303(A)), 1983)


16.20.020 Energy conservation.

A. The design of a major subdivision shall provide to the extent feasible for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision. Examples of passive or natural heating opportunities in subdivision design include design of lot size and configuration to permit orientation of a structure for southern exposure. Examples of passive or natural cooling opportunities in subdivision design include design of lot size and configuration to permit orientation of a structure to take advantage of shade or prevailing breezes.

B. In providing for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the design of a subdivision, consideration shall be given to local climate, to contour, to configuration of the parcel to be divided, and to other design and improvement requirements, and such provision shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building or structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time the tentative map is filed. The requirements of this section do not apply to condominium projects which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building when no new structures are added.

C. For the purpose of this section, “feasible” means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social and technological factors. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. III § 303(B)), 1983)


16.20.030 Access – Minor subdivisions.

Each lot within a minor subdivision shall front a public street and shall contain minimum lot frontage as specified by the Seaside zoning ordinance, except where a common interest subdivision provides access to the lots with one commonly owned and maintained driveway. Where access is provided to lots by a commonly owned and maintained driveway, the following design criteria and requirements shall be followed:

A. The common driveway shall be owned and maintained by all of the property owners being served.

B. Where possible, the common driveway shall provide automobile access to all lots contiguous to the common driveway.

C. A minimum driveway width shall be as follows:

1. A common driveway serving two or fewer parcels shall have a minimum width of ten feet;

2. A common driveway serving three or four parcels shall have a minimum width of sixteen feet.

Where appropriate, possible and necessary, a minimum of an additional three feet shall be reserved for landscaping along the entire length of the common driveway.

D. The common driveway shall extend away from a public street a maximum length of one hundred feet unless the subdivider provides on-site improvements to include an on-site fire hydrant installed according to the adopted city fire code and any other improvements deemed necessary by the fire chief or the city engineer.

E. The square footage required by the common driveway shall not be counted when computing density and minimum lot sizes.

F. The subdivider shall submit with the tentative map a maintenance agreement and a common ownership agreement acceptable to the chief of planning, the city engineer and the city attorney.

G. Where feasible, the common access driveway shall be located so that all dwelling units shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from the driveway. (Ord. 661 § 1, 1984; Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. III § 303(C)(1)), 1983)


16.20.040 Access – Tandem lot subdivisions.

Tandem lot subdivisions are an appropriate method of subdividing parcels of land which, while adequate in size and shape for use, are otherwise lacking in accessibility, or are land remnants remaining from previous subdivisions, or which, due to topographical or other natural barriers or to outmoded subdivision practice or the like, have heretofore been either impractical or uneconomical to subdivide. Since certain of the lots being created may not have full access to public streets, they must therefore be particularly reviewed as to accessibility and serviceability. The following provisions relating to such subdivisions shall apply:

D. That in the event of litigation occasioned by any default of the owner, his successors or assigns, the owner, his successors or assigns agree to pay all costs involved, including reasonable attorney’s fees, and that the same shall become a part of the lien against the real property.

E. That the term “owner” shall include not only the present owner but also his heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns, it being the intent of the parties hereto that the obligations herein undertaken shall run with the property and constitute a lien there against.

This agreement shall not relieve the owner from any other requirements specified herein. The construction of deferred improvements shall conform to the provisions of this title and all other applicable ordinances in effect at the time of construction. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. III § 304(D)(2)(a)), 1983)

The improvements shall be at the developer’s expense. In the absence of such an agreement, the city may require fulfillment of such construction requirements within a reasonable time following approval of the map, upon a finding that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for reasons of:

A. The public health and safety; or

B. The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. III § 304(D)(2)(b)), 1983)

Any unused fees or deposits previously made pursuant to this division of the property shall be credited pro rata towards any requirements for the same purposes which are applicable at the time of resubdivision.

Any street or easements to be left in effect after the resubdivision shall be adequately delineated on the map. After approval of the merger and resubdivision by the city council, the map shall be delivered to the county recorder. The filing of the map shall constitute legal merger and resubdivision of the land affected thereby, and shall also constitute abandonment of all streets and easements not shown on the map.

A. No person shall sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property or commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon, except for model homes, or allow occupancy thereof, for which a final or parcel map is required by this title, until such map thereof in full compliance with the provisions of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act has been filed for record in the county recorder’s office.

B. Conveyance of any part of a division of real property for which a final or parcel map is required by this title or the state Subdivision Map Act shall not be made by parcel or block number, initial or other designation, unless and until such map has been filed for record by the county recorder.

C. This section does not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or exempt from any law (including a local ordinance), regulating the design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established.

D. Nothing contained in subsection A of this section shall be deemed to prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease or finance real property or to construct improvements thereon where such sale, lease, or financing, or the commencement of such construction, is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final subdivision map or parcel map, as required by this title.

E. Any person who violates any provision of this title shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. VIII § 801), 1983)


16.44.020 Remedies.

A. Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or of the state Subdivision Map Act, is voidable at the sale option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, his heirs, personal representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy within one year after the date of discovery of the violation, but the deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his assignee, heir or devisee.

B. Any grantee, or his successor in interest, of real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title or of the state Subdivision Map Act, may, within one year of the date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the Superior Court to recover any damages he has suffered by reason of such division of property. The action may be brought against the person who divided the property in violation and against any successors in interest who have actual or constructive knowledge of such division of property.

C. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the conveyance of any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed pursuant to SMC 16.44.030 or identified in a recorded final map or parcel map, from and after the date of recording. The provisions of this section shall not limit or affect in any way the rights of a grantee or his successor in interest under any other provision of law.

D. This section does not bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which the city or other public agency or any person, firm or corporation may otherwise be entitled, and the city, other public agency, or such person, firm or corporation may file suit in the superior court of Monterey County to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision for sale, lease or financing in violation of this title.

E. The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is either the current owner of record or a vendee of the current owner of record pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of his interest in such real property. If the city issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any such real property, it may impose only those conditions that would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his interest in such real property, and which has been established at such time by this title or the state Subdivision Map Act, except that where the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation who, by a grant of the real property, created a parcel or parcels in violation of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act, and such person is the current owner of record of one or more of the parcels which were created as a result of the grant in violation, then the local agency may impose such conditions as would be applicable to a current division of the property, and except that if a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record under the provisions of SMC 16.44.030 only such conditions stipulated in that certificate shall be applicable. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. VIII § 802), 1983)


16.44.030 Certificate of compliance.

A. Any person owning real property within the city or a vendee of such person pursuant to a contract of sale of such real property may request, and the city shall determine, whether such real property complies with the provisions of this title.

B. Upon making such a determination, the city engineer shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division thereof complies with applicable provisions of this title and of the state Subdivision Map Act.

C. If the city engineer determines that such real property does not comply with the provisions of this title or of the state Subdivision Map Act, he may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose such conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his or her interest therein, and which had been established at such time by this title or the state Subdivision Map Act, except that where the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation who by a grant of the real property created a parcel or parcels in violation of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act, and such person is the current owner of record of one or more of the parcels which were created as a result of the grant in violation, then the local agency may impose such conditions as would be applicable to a current division of the property. Upon making such a determination and establishing such conditions, the city engineer shall cause a conditional certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. Such certificate shall serve as notice to the property owner or vendee who has applied for the certificate pursuant to this section, a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property that the fulfillment and implementation of such conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property. Compliance with such conditions shall not be required until such time as a permit or other grant of approval for development of such property is issued by the local agency.

D. A certificate of compliance shall be issued for any real property which has been approved for development pursuant to SMC 16.44.020(E).

E. A recorded final map or parcel map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein.

F. A fee to be charged at actual cost shall be charged to the applicant for making the determination and processing the certificate of compliance. A deposit may be required to be applied toward this fee. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. VIII § 803), 1983)


16.44.040 Certificate of noncompliance.

Whenever the city engineer has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the provisions of this title or the state Subdivision Map Act, he shall cause to be filed for record with the county recorder a tentative notice of violation (certificate of noncompliance) describing the real property in detail, naming the owners thereof, and describing the violation and stating that an opportunity will be given to the owner to present evidence. At least thirty days prior to the recording of a final notice, the owner of the real property shall be advised in writing of the intention to record a final notice specifying a time, date and place at which the owner may present evidence as to why such notice should not be recorded. If, after the owner has presented evidence, it is determined that there has been no violation, the local agency shall record a release of the notice of intention to record a notice of violation with the county recorder. If, however, after the owner has presented evidence, the city council determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, or if within sixty days of receipt of such copy the owner of such real property fails to inform the city engineer of his objection to recording the notice of violation, the city council shall record the notice of violation with the county recorder. The notice of intention to record a notice of violation and the notice of violation, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of violation to all successors in interest in such property. The county recorder shall index the names of the fee owners in the general index. (Ord. 626 § 1 (Art. VIII § 804), 1983)


16.44.050 Judicial review.

There shall be a ninety-day appeal period commencing at the tentative map approval during which time a person may take any action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void or annul the decision of the subdivision committee, the planning commission or the city council concerning a subdivision, or of any of the proceedings, acts or determinations taken, done or made prior to such decision, or to determine the reasonableness, legality or validity of any condition attached thereto. Thereafter, all persons are barred from any such action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or unreasonableness of such decision or of such proceedings, acts or determinations. Any such proceeding shall take precedence over all matters of the calendar of the court except criminal, probate, eminent domain and forcible entry and unlawful detainer proceedings.

17.02.010 Purposes of Zoning Ordinance

Title 17 of the Seaside Municipal Code constitutes the City of Seaside Zoning Ordinance, hereafter referred to as “this Zoning Ordinance.” This Zoning Ordinance carries out the policies of the Seaside General Plan by classifying and regulating the uses of land and structures within the City, consistent with the General Plan. This Zoning Ordinance is adopted to protect and to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare of residents, and businesses in the City. More specifically, the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance are to:

A.    Provide standards and guidelines for the continuing orderly growth and development of the City that will assist in protecting the character and community identity of Seaside;

B.    Conserve and protect the City’s natural beauty and setting, including waterways, hills and trees, scenic vistas, and historic and environmental resources;

C.    Create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land uses upon which to plan transportation, water supply, sewerage, energy, and other public facilities and utilities;

D.    Minimize automobile congestion by promoting pedestrian-oriented development, safe and effective traffic circulation, and adequate off-street parking facilities; and

E.    Insure compatibility between different types of development and land use.


17.02.020 Authority, Relationship to General Plan

A.    Authority. The regulations within this Zoning Ordinance are enacted based on the authority vested in the City of Seaside by the state of California, including but not limited to: the California Constitution; the Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Section 65000 et seq.); the Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Section 66410 et seq.); and the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.).

B.    Consistency with General Plan. This Zoning Ordinance is a primary tool used by the City to carry out the goals, objectives, and policies of the Seaside General Plan. The Seaside City Council intends that all provisions of this Zoning Ordinance be consistent with the General Plan, and that any land use, subdivision, or development approved in compliance with these regulations will also be consistent with the General Plan.


17.02.030 Responsibility for Administration

A.    Responsible bodies and individuals. This Zoning Ordinance shall be administered by: the Seaside City Council, hereafter referred to as the “Council”; the Planning Commission, referred to as the “Commission”; the Resource Management Services Director, referred to as the “Director”; the Zoning Administrator and the Resource Management Services Department, hereafter referred to as the “Department.”

B.    Exercise of discretion. In the event that a provision of this Zoning Ordinance allows the review authority for a permit or other decision to exercise discretion in the application of a specific standard or requirement to a project, but does not identify specific criteria for a decision, discretion shall be based on the following criteria:

1.    The proposed project complies with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance;

2.    The exercise of discretion will act to improve the compatibility of the proposed project with its site, surrounding properties, and the community, to a greater extent than if discretion were not exercised;

3.    The manner in which discretion is exercised will result in a more practical application of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance given specific characteristics of the site and its surroundings than if discretion were not exercised; and

4.    The decision is consistent with the General Plan and any other applicable regulation or standard.


17.02.040 Applicability of the Zoning Ordinance

This Zoning Ordinance applies to all land uses, subdivisions, and development within the City of Seaside, as follows:

A.    New land uses or structures, changes to land uses or structures. It shall be unlawful, and a violation of this Zoning Ordinance for any person to establish, construct, reconstruct, alter, or replace any use of land or structure, except in compliance with the requirements of Section 17.10.020 (General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses), and Chapter 17.72 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels). No Building Permit or Grading Permit shall be issued by the City unless the proposed construction complies with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.

B.    Subdivisions. Any subdivision of land proposed within the City after the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall be consistent with the minimum parcel size requirements of Article 2 (Zones, Permitted Land Uses, and Zoning Standards), the City’s Subdivision Ordinance, and all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.

C.    Continuation of an existing land use. An existing land use is lawful and not in violation of this Zoning Ordinance only when operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, including Chapter 17.72 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels). However, the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance are not retroactive in their effect on a land use that was lawfully established before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or any applicable amendment, except as otherwise provided by Chapter 17.72.

D.    Effect of Zoning Ordinance changes on projects in progress.

1.    A project that is under construction on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment, need not be changed to satisfy any new or different requirements of this Zoning Ordinance; provided, that the approved use of the site shall be established, including the completion of all structures and other features of the project as shown on the approved permit, before the expiration of the permit, or applicable time extension.

E.    Minimum requirements. The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. When this Zoning Ordinance provides for discretion on the part of a review authority (designated City official or body), that discretion may be exercised to impose more stringent requirements than set forth in this Zoning Ordinance, as may be determined by the applicable review authority to be necessary to promote orderly land use and development, environmental resource protection, and the other purposes of this Zoning Ordinance.

F.    Conflicting requirements.

1.    Zoning Ordinance and Municipal Code provisions. If conflicts occur between requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, or between this Zoning Ordinance and the Seaside Municipal Code, or other regulations of the City, the most restrictive shall apply.

2.    Development agreements or specific plans. If conflicts occur between the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and standards adopted as part of any development agreement or applicable specific plan, the requirements of the development agreement or specific plan shall apply.

a.    A development agreement vests on approval, but it shall not change otherwise applicable Zoning Ordinance requirements.

b.    In the event of a conflict between the provisions of an adopted specific plan and this Zoning Ordinance, this Zoning Ordinance should be amended to be consistent with the specific plan.

3.    Private agreements. This Zoning Ordinance applies to all land uses and development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser restriction on the development or use of structures or land than a private agreement or restriction (for example, CC&Rs), without affecting the applicability of any agreement or restriction. The City shall not enforce any private covenant or agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement, or a portion thereof.

G.    Federal lands. Federal agencies are not subject to the provisions and permit requirements of these regulations. Non-federal development on federal lands may be subject to the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.

H.    State, county, local agency, and school district sites and facilities. The requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall apply to all sites and facilities of the state of California, county of Monterey, and any school district or other local agency within the City to the maximum extent allowed by law.

I.    Other requirements may apply. Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance eliminates the need for obtaining any other permits required by the City, or any permit, approval or entitlement required by any other applicable special district or agency, and/or the regulations of any state or federal agency.

This chapter describes the City’s requirements for the approval of proposed development and new land uses. The permit requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance for specific land uses are in Chapters 17.12 through 17.24.


17.10.020 General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses

Each land use and/or structure within the City shall be established, constructed, reconstructed, altered, moved or replaced in compliance with the following requirements:

A.    Permitted uses. The land use shall be allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in the zone designated to the site. The basis for determining whether a use is allowable is described in Section 17.10.030 (Permitted Land Uses and Planning Permit Requirements).

B.    Planning permit and approval requirements. Any planning permit or other approval required by Section 17.10.030 (Permitted Land Uses and Planning Permit Requirements) shall be obtained before the issuance of any required grading, building, or other construction permit, and before the proposed use is constructed, otherwise established or put into operation, unless the proposed use is listed in Section 17.10.040 (Exemptions from Planning Permit Requirements).

C.    Development standards, conditions of approval. Each land use and structure shall comply with the development standards of this chapter, applicable standards and requirements in Articles 3 (Site Planning, Design, and Operational Standards), and 4 (Standards for Specific Land Uses), and any applicable conditions imposed by a previously granted planning permit, except where any of these are superseded by the standards and requirements of an adopted and current redevelopment plan.

D.    Legal parcel. The site of a proposed development or new land use shall be a parcel that was legally created in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act and the City’s Subdivision Ordinance.


17.10.030 Permitted Land Uses and Planning Permit Requirements

A.    Permitted land uses. The uses of land allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each zone are listed in tables in Chapters 17.12, 17.18, and 17.24, together with the type of planning permit required for each use. Each listed land use is defined in Article 7 (Glossary).

1.    Establishment of a permitted use.

a.    Any one or more land uses identified as being permitted within a specific zone may be established on any parcel within that zone, subject to the planning permit requirements of Subsection B of this section, and compliance with all applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.

b.    Where a single parcel is proposed for development with two or more of the land uses listed in the tables at the same time, the overall project shall be subject to the highest permit level required by Subsection B of this section for any individual use.

2.    Use not listed.

a.    A land use that is not listed and is determined by the Director to not be included in Article 7 (Glossary) under the definition of a listed land use, is not allowed within the City, except as otherwise provided in Subsection A.3 of this section, or Section 17.10.040 (Exemptions from Planning Permit Requirements).

b.    A land use that is not listed in the tables within a particular zone is not allowed within that zone, except as otherwise provided in Subsection A.3 of this section, or Section 17.10.040.

3.    Similar and compatible use may be allowed. The Director may determine that a proposed use not listed in this article is allowable as follows:

a.    Required findings. The Director may determine that a proposed use is similar to and compatible with a listed use and may be allowed, only after first making all of the following findings with the determination:

(1)    The characteristics of, and activities associated with the use are similar to one or more of the listed uses, and will not involve a greater intensity than the uses listed in the zone;

(2)    The use will be consistent with the purposes of the applicable zone;

(3)    The use will be consistent with the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan;

(4)    The use will be compatible with the other uses allowed in the zone; and

(5)    The use is not listed as allowable in another zone.

A determination that a use qualifies as a similar and compatible use, and the findings supporting the determination shall be in writing.

b.    Applicable standards and permit requirements. When the Director determines that a proposed, but unlisted use is similar and compatible to a listed use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use in determining where it is allowed, what permits are required, and what other standards and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance apply. Once such a determination is made, the Director shall, at the next earliest opportunity, process a text amendment to the Zoning Ordinance in accordance with Chapter 17.74 (Amendments) in order to reflect the determination.

c.    Referral for determination. The Director may refer the question of whether a proposed use qualifies as a similar and compatible use directly to the Commission for a determination at a public meeting.

d.    Appeal. A determination of similar and compatible use may be appealed in compliance with Chapter 17.76 (Appeals).

B.    Permit requirements. Tables 2-1, 2-4, and 2-7 within Chapters 17.12 through 17.14 provide for land uses that are:

1.    Permitted subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, subject to first obtaining a Zoning Clearance (Section 17.62.020). These are shown as “P” uses in the tables;

2.    Allowed subject to the approval of a Minor Use Permit (Section 17.62.070), and shown as “MUP” uses in the tables;

3.    Allowed subject to the approval of a Use Permit (Section 17.62.070), and shown as “UP” uses in the tables;

4.    Allowed subject to specific standards and/or City approvals of Chapter 17.52 (Standards for Specific Land Uses), noted with the specific code section in as Tables 2-1, 2-4, and 2-7;

5.    Not allowed in particular zones, and shown as “–” in the tables.

17.12.020 Purposes of the Residential Zones

The purposes of the individual residential zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows:

A.    RS (Single-Family Residential) zone. The RS zone is applied to areas of the City that are appropriate for neighborhoods of detached single-family dwellings, surrounding the more densely developed core of the City. The maximum allowable residential density within the RS zone is up to eight dwelling units per acre in areas designated Low Density Single-Family Residential (RLS) by the General Plan and shown on the Zoning Map as RS-8, and up to 12 dwelling units per acre in areas designated Medium Density Single-Family Residential (RMS) by the General Plan and shown on the Zoning Map as RS-12. The RS zone implements and is consistent with the Low Density Single-Family Residential (RLS) and Medium Density Single-Family Residential (RMS) land use designations of the General Plan, with maximum allowable density indicated on the Zoning Map by either a numerical suffix to the RS designation (e.g., RS-12).

B.    RM (Medium Density Residential) zone. The RM zone is applied to areas of the City that are appropriate for neighborhoods with a variety of housing types including attached and detached single-family dwellings, duplexes and triplexes, and some condominiums. The maximum allowable residential density within the RM zone is 15 dwelling units per acre. The RM zone implements and is consistent with the Medium Density Residential (RM) land use designation of the General Plan.

C.    RH (High Density Residential) zone. The RH zone is applied to areas of the City that are appropriate for a mixture of multi-family housing, including apartments, townhomes, and condominiums, and professional offices, convalescent homes, and care facilities. The maximum allowable residential density within the RH zone is 25 dwelling units per acre. The RH zone implements and is consistent with the High Density Residential (RH) land use designation of the General Plan.


17.12.030 Residential Zone Permitted Land Uses and Permit Requirements

A.    General permit requirements. Table 2-1 identifies the land uses allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each residential zone, and the planning permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section 17.10.030 (Permitted Land Uses and Planning Permit Requirements).

B.    Architectural Review. A land use that is identified by this chapter as permitted, or allowed with a Use Permit or Minor Use Permit approval may also require Architectural Review. See Section 17.62.030 for Architectural Review requirements.

C.    Requirements for certain specific land uses. Where the last column in Table 2-1 (“Specific Use Regulations”) includes a section number, the referenced section may affect whether the use requires a Zoning Clearance, Minor Use Permit, or Use Permit, and/or may establish other requirements and standards applicable to the use.

17.14.010 Purpose

This chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the commercial zones established by Section 17.06.020 (Zoning Map and Zones), determines the type of planning permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.


17.14.020 Purposes of Commercial Zones

The purposes of the individual commercial zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows:

A.    CMX (Commercial-Mixed Use) zone. The CMX zone is applied to areas of the City identified by the General Plan as appropriate for pedestrian- and transit-oriented activity centers. The CMX zone is intended to accommodate retail stores, offices, theaters, restaurants, and other similar and related uses together with residential units in the context of mixed use, pedestrian-oriented development, although mixed use development is not required. The maximum allowable residential density within the CMX zone for the residential component of a mixed use project is 25 dwelling units per acre; the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 2.0. The CMX zone implements and is consistent with the Mixed Use (MX) land use designation of the General Plan.

B.    CC (Community Commercial) zone. The CC zone is applied to areas of the City that are intended for retail and service-oriented business activities primarily serving the local community or neighborhood. Permitted land uses may include restaurants, supermarkets, health clubs, offices, retail sales, services, personal services, and neighborhood-oriented retail uses. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 0.50; except that a maximum FAR of 2.0 is allowed within the Broadway Corridor Specific Plan area designated by the General Plan. The CC zone implements and is consistent with the Community Commercial (CC) land use designation of the General Plan.

C.    CRG (Regional Commercial) zone. The CRG zone is applied to areas of the City that are appropriate for large-scale commercial development with retail, entertainment, and/or service uses, or business parks of a scale and function to serve a regional market. Permitted land uses may include hotels, “big-box” retail, movie theaters, and business parks in the North Seaside area only. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 1.0; except that hotels are allowed a maximum FAR of 3.0. The CRG zone implements and is consistent with the Regional Commercial (RCC) land use designation of the General Plan.

D.    CA (Automotive Regional Commercial) zone. The CA zone is applied to the area covered by the Gateway Auto Center Area Plan, to provide a consolidated area for new automotive dealerships and related and compatible uses. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 1.0. The CA zone is consistent with and implements the Regional Commercial (RGC) land use designation of the General Plan.

E.    CH (Heavy Commercial) zone. The CH zone is applied to areas of the City suitable for wholesale, heavy commercial, and light industrial uses that which are best suited away from areas regularly generating large amounts of pedestrian traffic. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 0.5. The CH zone implements and is consistent with the Heavy Commercial (HC) land use designation of the General Plan.


17.14.030 Commercial Zone Land Uses and Permit Requirements

A.    General permit requirements. Table 2-4 identifies the uses of land allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each commercial zone, and the planning permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section 17.10.030 (Permitted Land Uses and Planning Permit Requirements).

B.    Requirements for certain specific land uses. Where the last column in Table 2-4 (“Specific Use Regulations”) includes a section number, the referenced section may affect whether the use requires a Zoning Clearance, Minor Use Permit, or Use Permit, and/or may establish other requirements and standards applicable to the use.

A.    Purpose. The requirements of this section are intended to provide for pedestrian orientation and traditional building form in the CMX zones. A principal design objective of this section is for the street frontages in this zone to have continuous building facades with as few interruptions as possible in the progression of stores and other buildings, creating attractive, pedestrian oriented streetscapes.

B.    Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to proposed development within the CMX (Commercial Mixed Use) zone. Each new nonresidential structure, and all alterations to existing structures involving any change in the facade at the street frontage, shall comply with the standards of this section. The review authority may approve minor variations to these standards as deemed appropriate; provided, that the review authority also first finds that the minor variation will still produce a new or altered building that complies with the intent of this section.

C.    Building placement. Each building shall be designed so that its front facade occupies 100 percent of its front property line. The review authority may grant exceptions to this requirement for:

1.    A driveway that is necessary because no side street, alley, or easement can provide access to required parking on the rear of the lot;

2.    The initial phases of a multi-phased building project that will occupy the entire frontage upon completion;

3.    A multiple building project proposed with a pedestrian-only plaza occupying a portion of the street frontage;

4.    A pedestrian corridor; or

5.    A view corridor to on- or off-site natural features, or pedestrian areas on the rear portions of the site.

D.    Building design and architectural elements. Each building shall be designed to comply with the following requirements:

1.    Formula design prohibited. The architectural style and exterior materials of each proposed structure shall be designed based upon the architectural traditions of Monterey County, the architectural styles prevalent in the site vicinity, and the characteristics of the site, as determined by the review authority. The review authority shall not approve a building proposed with architectural features substantially similar to those found in other communities on buildings operated by the same corporate or franchise entity, unless the review authority determines that the similar features are also reflective of local architectural traditions and styles.

2.    Facade articulation. To encourage visual continuity and pedestrian activity, at least 60 percent of the total street frontage ground floor length of any new or reconstructed building shall be differentiated architecturally by recessed windows and entries, display windows, offset surfaces, differentiated piers and columns, offset planes, textured materials, awnings, or other details or displays of interest to pedestrians.

3.    Windows. Clear, untinted glass shall occupy at least 80 percent of the ground-floor street-fronting facades of each building, to allow maximum visual interaction between sidewalk areas and the interior of buildings. Mirrored, reflective glass or tinted glass shall not be used except as an architectural or decorative accent. After installation, clear glass windows shall not later be treated or so as to become opaque, or to be blocked so as to prevent visibility of the ground floor interior from the sidewalk.

4.    Railings and decorative grilles. Any decorative railing or grille work that is placed behind street level windows shall be at least 75 percent open to perpendicular view and no more than six feet in height above grade. No security gate or grille shall be installed on the exterior of any structure.

5.    Upper story design features. A minimum of 50 percent of the building frontage width above the first story shall be differentiated by recessed windows, balconies, offset planes, or other architectural details that provide dimensional relief.

E.    Pedestrian access to buildings. The primary entrance of each ground floor use shall be located within the primary building frontage, and shall be recessed a minimum of three feet when accessed from the public right-of-way. Walk-up facilities and entries shall be recessed and provide adequate queuing space to avoid interruption of pedestrian flow.

Proposed development and new land uses within the CA (Automotive Regional Commercial) zone shall comply with the standards and guidelines as established under Chapter 17.16 (Automotive Regional Commercial (CA) Zone Standards), where applicable, in addition to the requirements of Section 17.14.050 (Commercial Zone Site Planning and Building Standards).


Chapter 17.16 AUTOMOTIVE REGIONAL COMMERCIAL (CA) ZONE STANDARDS

Sections:

17.16.010    Purpose

17.16.020    Applicability

17.16.030    Submittal Requirements

17.16.040    Architectural Design Requirements

17.16.050    Sign Requirements

17.16.060    Landscape Design Requirements

17.16.070    Screening, Fences/Walls/Gates, and Outdoor Storage Areas

17.16.080    Lighting Design Requirements


17.16.010 Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to establish development standards for all uses within the CA (Automotive Regional Commercial) zoning district by ensuring that the character of the area is presented with integrity and creativity while maintaining a congruent appearance throughout the CA zone. These standards will ensure consistency and compatibility between the exterior appearances of buildings while providing flexibility for tenants to identify themselves through innovative design. The landscaping standards will result in well designed and maintained sites while the lighting standards will provide for safety of pedestrians and motorists and well as protection of adjacent properties from glare and light spillover.


17.16.020 Applicability

All uses within the CA (Automotive Regional Commercial) zone, with the exception of public safety facilities and automated teller machines, shall be subject to the standards set forth in this chapter (See Figure 2-1, Automotive Regional Commercial Zone).
[IMAGE]


Figure 2-1 – Automotive Regional Commercial Zone


17.16.030 Submittal Requirements

Elements regulated by Sections 17.16.040 through 17.16.080 must receive design approval from the Board of Architectural Review. At the time a project application is filed, all plans and information, along with any necessary forms and fees, shall be submitted to the City as outlined in the Automotive Regional Commercial Submittal Guidelines (available from the Planning Department).


17.16.040 Architectural Design Requirements

A.    Purpose. The requirements of this section are intended to provide for pedestrian- and customer-oriented design and encourage modern and contemporary building styles in the CA zone. The primary design objectives of this section are to create a unified CA zone district and attractive streetscapes. The intent of these standards is not to limit innovative design approaches, nor is it to have all dealerships look exactly alike. Manufacturer image programs are acceptable. The Board of Architectural Review may grant exceptions to the requirements of this section that are not otherwise subject to Subsection 17.62.080.C.2 (Minor Variance).

B.    Building design requirements.

1.    Colors. The color palette used on the exterior of the main showroom building shall be used on each subsequent building located on the property and shall work to integrate all architectural elements of the building.

2.    Facade articulation.

a.    To encourage visual continuity, at least 60 percent of the total length of any new or reconstructed building wall/facade shall be differentiated architecturally by using a combination of recessed windows and entries, display windows, offset surfaces, differentiated piers and columns, offset planes, textured materials, or other details or displays of interest to pedestrians (see Figure 2-2 – Facade Articulation).

b.    Facade elements (e.g., windows, doors, bays, joints) shall display a logical rhythm and order. Articulation shall be simple in form, avoiding overly articulated and random features, which can be visually confusing. Articulation and detailing shall not consist solely of color changes without changes in material or planes, as color change alone does not create a feeling of permanence, variety, or interest (see Figure 2-2 – Facade Articulation).
[IMAGE]


Figure 2-2 – Facade Articulation

c.    Building facades shall be articulated at the street level to provide visual interest through the use of materials, colors, and architectural detailing.

d.    All sides of a building visible from the public right-of-way shall have a consistent style and use of materials. While the primary frontage may utilize special architectural treatments, a common theme of basic primary exterior finish materials and colors shall be used on all building facades.

e.    In no case shall any facade consist of unarticulated blank walls visible from the public right-of-way, exterior vehicle display areas, or other areas accessible to the public.

3.    Windows.

a.    Clear glass on the ground floor of each building shall be used to facilitate maximum visual interaction between exterior vehicle display areas and the interior of buildings. “Clear glass” means glass that is generally transparent (e.g., less than 50 percent tinting). The use of mirrored, reflective, tinted, or smoked glass is strictly prohibited (see Subsection C of this section, Prohibited building materials).

b.    After installation, clear glass windows shall not be treated to become mirrored, reflective, tinted, or smoked or prevent visibility of the building’s interior from public spaces or the public right-of-way in any other manner.

4.    Upper story design features. A minimum of 50 percent of the length of each building facade above the first story shall be differentiated by architectural details that provide dimensional relief (see Figure 2-3 – Upper Story Design Features).
[IMAGE]


Figure 2-3 – Upper Story Design Features

5.    Screening.

a.    Roof mounted mechanical equipment, ductwork, vents, access ladders, and any other equipment located on any roof visible from public rights-of-way, pedestrian walkways and areas accessible to the public shall be screened. The equipment shall be screened through the use of architectural elements (parapets, roofs, etc.) (see Subsection 17.16.070.B.7, Screening Requirements – ground-mounted equipment).

b.    Individual equipment screens are not permitted unless they are determined by the Board of Architectural Review to be consistent with the overall building design.

6.    Building orientation.

a.    Service bays and required parking spaces shall be oriented, and located at, the rear of the property or in a location that limits visibility of the bays from the public right-of-way (see Section 17.26.060, Landscape Design Requirements).

b.    Buildings and exterior vehicle display areas shall be sited to complement the existing topography, site configuration, and adjacent uses.

c.    No building shall be closer than 15 feet from the back of the public rights-of-way along Fremont and Del Monte Boulevards. Exception: The setback requirement along Fremont and Del Monte Boulevards may be reduced for the following use (as listed in Table 2-4 – Allowed Land Uses and Permit Requirements for Commercial Zones): Auto and vehicle sales, new vehicles, with accessory used sales which include showroom, administrative offices and work bays when screened.

C.    Prohibited building materials. The following building materials are prohibited (also see Subsection 17.16.070.D.1, Prohibited materials):

17.16.060 Landscape Design Requirements

A.    Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to improve the appearance of the CA zone by providing on-site landscaping that is visible from public rights-of-way, adjacent properties and to conserve water through the use of drought-tolerant plant species.

B.    Definitions. See Chapter 17.98 (Definitions).

C.    Approvals.

1.    Statement of surety. The Zoning Administrator may require statements of surety for phased development projects, a legitimate delay in landscape installation due to seasonal requirements (including adverse weather conditions) and similar circumstances where it may not be advisable or desirable to install all approved landscaping before occupancy of the site. When required by the Zoning Administrator, security in the form of cash, performance bond, letter of credit, or instrument of credit, in an amount equal to 150 percent of the total value of all plant materials, irrigation, installation, and maintenance shall be posted with the City for a two-year period in compliance with Section 17.64.070 (Performance Guarantees).

2.    Installation and inspection. All landscaping shall be installed and inspected by a representative of the Planning Department before the City will perform a final building inspection or authorize the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.

3.    Maintenance agreement. Before final inspection or occupancy, and before the recordation of a final subdivision map where applicable, the applicant shall enter into a landscape maintenance agreement with the City to guarantee proper maintenance in compliance with the above regulations. The City Attorney and the Zoning Administrator shall approve the form and content of the agreement.

D.    Landscape design. Landscaping shall be provided in the locations, consistent with the provided design standards listed below:

1.    Required landscaping.

a.    “Landscaping” includes berms, decorative fences and walls, perennials, lawn/turf, ground cover, hedges, shrubs, and trees within a designated area.

(1)    Permeable pavers or stamped concrete may be used to satisfy the landscape requirement only if used in combination with at least one of the items defined above as “landscaping.”

(2)    The landscaping shall be incorporated with the pavers and shall occupy a minimum of 50 percent of the proposed area and shall be dispersed along the entire length of the paved surface.

b.    A minimum five percent of the total site area shall be landscaped. Landscape materials shall be selected from the approved plant lists available from the Planning Department.

2.    Minimum dimensions.

a.    Wherever this section requires a landscape area of a specified width, the width shall be measured within any curb or wall bordering the landscape area.

b.    Each landscape area shall have a minimum interior length of eight feet and a width of three feet.

c.    Lawn areas require minimum dimensions of 10 feet or greater.

d.    The requirement may be reduced if the Board of Architectural Review determines the minimum dimensions are infeasible due to site constraints such as limited site area and manufacturer-required exterior display area. Alternatives such as container planting and permeable paving without “landscaping” elements shall be required if the minimum dimensions are reduced by the Board of Architectural Review.

3.    Planting requirements.

a.    In order to achieve a more immediate effect, all trees planted on the street sides of a newly developed parcel shall be transplanted from a minimum 24-inch box size container.

b.    A tree proposed to replace an existing mature specimen tree shall be transplanted from a minimum 24-inch box size container.

c.    All trees shall be adequately supported when planted. The supports shall be maintained until the trees are capable of withstanding the force of wind on their own.

d.    Nonbiodegradable root barriers shall be installed around new trees planted within five feet of, and in, the public right-of-way to direct tree root growth downward and away from adjacent sidewalks, curbs, gutters, driveways, and other public improvements. Root barriers may be eliminated where the combination of tree species, soil type, soil area, and drainage conditions can be shown to afford equivalent protection against tree root damage to public improvements.

e.    Organic amendments shall be added to the soil to improve soil structure and other physical properties of the soil. Examples of organic amendments include compost, composted sawdust, peat moss, and redwood soil conditioner.

f.    Woody groundcovers shall be planted from containers or liners and the area between plants shall be covered with a two-inch bark mulch layer or herbaceous groundcovers.

g.    Porous mulch shall be applied to the soil surface at a minimum of a two-inch layer to reduce evaporation and retard weed growth. One of the following materials will be used: compost, decomposed granite, or wood chips.

(3)    A concentration of landscape elements shall be provided at primary building entrances, and shall include specimen trees, flowering plants, and enhanced paving.

(4)    Landscaping shall be located so that pedestrians are not required to cross unpaved landscaped areas to reach building entrances from parked cars. This shall be achieved through proper orientation of the landscaped fingers and islands, and by providing pedestrian access through landscaped areas that would otherwise block direct pedestrian routes.

8.    Perimeter landscaping. Landscaping shall be located to create separation between on-site structures and customer and employee parking spaces.

a.    Adjacent to structures. When customer and employee parking areas are located adjacent to a structure, a landscape strip with a minimum depth of three feet that spans the entire length of the adjacent parking stalls shall be provided immediately adjacent to the structure, exclusive of any building entries, or areas immediately adjacent to the wall of the structure that serve as pedestrian access ways. The required dimensions of the landscape strip may be reduced by the Board of Architectural Review where it determines that overall site area is insufficient to accommodate allowable structures and required parking along with a landscape strip of the otherwise required width.

E.    Irrigation system requirements. All landscaped areas shall include an automatic irrigation system. The design of the irrigation system shall be consistent with the following requirements:

Soil moisture-sensing devices and rain sensors shall be used on larger projects (50,000 plus square feet of landscaped area) to minimize or eliminate overwatering.

6.    The irrigation system shall deliver water efficiently and uniformly and shall be appropriate to the needs of the plant materials.

7.    Watering shall be scheduled at times of minimal wind conflict and evaporation loss.

8.    Sprinkler heads shall have matched precipitation rates within each valve zone.

9.    Check valves are required where elevation differential may cause low head drainage.

10.    Sprinkler heads located within 12 inches of a walkway or parking area shall be pop-up type.

11.    The irrigation system will be equipped with an automatic rain shut-off device.

F.    Landscape lighting. The use of landscape lighting to highlight the unique design features and surrounding landscape design may be approved by the Board of Architectural Review, in accordance with the following standards:

1.    The lighting will illuminate a landscape feature that is unique to the particular project due to the use of materials, colors, or design characteristics which are not commonly found within the CA zone. 

2.    The landscape lighting proposal will enhance the design of a project and is not solely used as an attention-getting device. 

3.    Highlighting fixtures shall be located on the adjacent ground. These fixtures are to be arranged such that they are not generally visible from the public right-of-way. 

4.    Highlighting fixtures shall be located and designed in such a manner that the actual lamp and reflector are shielded or louvered so that it is not seen from a normal public viewing area. It is especially important in areas where there is considerable vehicle and pedestrian traffic that direct glare be avoided.

G.    Landscape maintenance criteria. The following maintenance criteria shall apply to all site landscaping and irrigation:

1.    Landscaping.

a.    The developer, his successor and/or subsequent owners and their agents shall be responsible for continued landscape maintenance.

All landscaping will be subject to periodic inspection by City personnel as designated by the Zoning Administrator.

c.    Regular maintenance shall include aerating and de-thatching lawn areas; adding/replenishing mulch, fertilizer, and soil amendments; and mowing, pruning, trimming, and watering all landscaped areas. In addition, the landscaping shall regularly be kept free of weeds and debris.

d.    Plants shall be pruned in accordance with professional trimming standards to maintain their intended shapes and sizes, and to ensure the health of the specimen and the safety of the public. “Topping” is not permitted because it causes severe injury to trees. Any trees that are topped shall be removed and replaced with a specimen one size larger than what is specified on the approved plans.

e.    Plants shall be pruned to avoid blocking walks, passageways, visibility areas and sight distance views for vehicular traffic.

f.    Shrubs and vines used for screening trash enclosures and service areas shall be pruned to maximize screening while allowing access to the storage/service areas.

g.    All fences and walls that have been incorporated into an approved landscaping plan shall regularly be maintained in an attractive and safe manner.

h.    Shrubs, trees, and vines for screening adjacent properties shall be kept pruned so they do not interfere with pedestrian traffic and do not encroach excessively onto the adjacent property.

i.    Trees shall be watered deeply to promote deeper rooting and shall be fertilized as required by sound horticultural practices.

j.    Tree guys and stake ties shall be inspected and adjusted periodically, and removed when necessary, to ensure that they are adequately surrounding the tree without girdling trunks or branches.

k.    Trees selected shall grow to maturity without impacts to sidewalks, curbs, and other public improvements.

l.    Any required plant material that dies after installation shall be replaced within 30 calendar days of plant death with the same size and species of plant material shown on the approved plan. Required plant material that dies after three years or more after installation, or is not maintained in accordance with the maintenance criteria, shall be replaced with a gallon or box size specimen one size larger than what is specified on the approved plans (shrubs: one-gallon, five-gallon, 15-gallon; trees: 15-gallon, 24-inch box, 30-inch box, 36-inch box, 42-inch box, 48-inch box).

m.    Dead plants shall be replaced with those materials specified in the original approval, damaged branches shall be removed, and overgrown areas shall be thinned by the selective removal of excessive growth.

n.    Required landscaped areas including those installed and dedicated by the City shall not be reduced in area or planting.

2.    Irrigation systems.

a.    Water waste resulting from inefficient landscape irrigation leading to excessive runoff, low head drainage, overspray, and other similar conditions where water flows onto adjacent property, nonirrigated areas, public right-of-way, walks, roadways, or structures is prohibited.

b.    The irrigation system will be checked, as part of scheduled maintenance, to prevent overspray outside of the desired planting area, especially water that wets adjacent hard surfaces (e.g., patios, sidewalks, and streets).

c.    The irrigation system will be checked, as part of scheduled maintenance, to prevent runoff. If runoff occurs, then the water application rate will be reduced so it is not greater than the infiltration rate of the soil.

d.    Regular maintenance shall include checking, adjusting, and repairing irrigation equipment, resetting automatic controllers, and watering all landscaped areas after maintenance is performed in order to verify proper working condition.

3.    Enforcement. Should landscaping not be installed, maintained and replaced as specified in the maintenance criteria, the owner and his agent or agents shall be considered in violation of the terms of the Building or Occupancy Permit. The Zoning Administrator is empowered to enforce the requirements of the CA zone standards Chapter 17.80 (Enforcement and Penalties).

(2)    When installed to illuminate a second-story entry eave, balcony, or outside stairway or door, the installation height shall be no higher than eight feet above the finished floor elevation of the second story.

c.    Architectural lighting. The use of architectural lighting to highlight the unique features of a building may be approved by the Board of Architectural Review in accordance with the following standards:

(1)    The lighting will illuminate an architectural feature that is unique to the particular project due to the use of materials, colors, or design characteristics which are not commonly found within the CA zone.

(2)    The architectural lighting proposal will enhance the design of a project and is not solely used as an attraction-seeking device.

(3)    Highlighting fixtures shall be located either on the building or on adjacent ground. These fixtures are to be arranged such that they are not generally visible from the public right-of-way. 

(4)    Highlighting fixtures shall be located and designed in such a manner that the actual lamp and reflector are shielded or louvered so that it is not seen from a normal public viewing area. It is especially important in areas where there is considerable vehicle and pedestrian traffic and direct glare be avoided.

d.    Freestanding light fixture height.

(1)    Allowable heights of light fixtures shall be measured from finished grade to the bottom of the light-emitting surface.

(2)    Pole mounted fixtures shall not exceed 26 feet in height as measured from the finished grade, adjacent to the base of concrete pedestal (limited to a maximum height of two feet) on which the light pole is located, to bottom of the light emitting surface.

(3)    Concrete light fixture pedestals located within the vehicle display area shall not exceed two feet by two feet. 

F.    Levels of illumination. Outdoor lighting illuminations shall be designed to illuminate at the minimum level necessary for safety and security, and to avoid the harsh contrasts in lighting levels between the project site and adjacent properties. Lighting shall not be of a high intensity so as to cause a traffic hazard, be used as an advertising element, or adversely affect adjacent properties. Illumination standards are as follows:

1.    The average level of illuminance for the display areas shall not exceed an average of 50 foot-candles with a maximum level of 65 foot-candles.

2.    The average level of illuminance for lighting within service areas shall not exceed an average of five foot-candles with a maximum level of 10 foot-candles.

G.    Energy conservation. The regulation of outdoor light fixtures can result in conservation of electrical energy and thus reduce the use of fossil fuel. Light fixtures shall be subject to the following standards:

1.    Fixtures shall have good optical control to distribute light in the most effective and efficient manner.

2.    Fixtures shall use the minimum amount of light necessary for display and security purposes.

3.    Fixtures shall have full cut-off, down-lit fixtures.

4.    Energizing light fixtures only when necessary by means of automatic timing devices.

5.    Preservation of night skies: Comply with City’s General Plan policies. The sky is an important aspect of our environment, and it is necessary for the City to regulate the use of outdoor light fixtures to minimize light pollution, which has a detrimental effect on the environment, astronomical research, amateur astronomy, enjoyment of the night sky, and causes unnecessary illumination of adjacent properties.

H.    Security lighting.

1.    Security lighting shall be provided and shall be limited to the following: all on-site pedestrian walkway lighting, a maximum one-third of the parking lot lights, lights over all building entries, and motion detector lights.

b.    Motion detector lights shall not be disabled to allow for continuous illumination.

I.    Automatic timing devices. Timing devices enhance the flexibility of the design by providing the right amount of light at the right time. Turning lights off in noncritical areas will eliminate nuisance light on adjacent areas at night. Controls can adjust lighting levels based on the level of activity at different times during the evening. The energy savings achieved by incorporating lighting controls can be much more effective in saving energy than the selection of the light source.

1.    Parking lot lights shall be equipped with a photocell so they automatically turn on at dusk.

2.    All outdoor light fixtures shall be turned off no later than 11:00 p.m. or one-half hour after close of business, whichever is earlier. The exception to this standard shall be for one-third of the parking lot lights, which, for security purposes, shall be reduced to less than half the illumination level used during business hours.

J.    Monitoring. The City may decide to restrict lighting to a level less than that specified in the approved photometric plans if it is determined that the lighting levels of individual dealership, in combination with surrounding City-installed lighting, has the potential for creating traffic hazards and/or is not consistent with the intent of the CA zone lighting standards.

17.30.040 Landscaping Standards

A.    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to improve the physical appearance of property within the City, and to provide appropriate landscape buffers where necessary.

B.    Landscaping required. All parts of a parcel not devoted to decks, patios, structures, and similar improvements, driveway and/or parking improvements, lighting, sidewalks, signs, and solid waste/recyclable materials collection and storage shall be landscaped in compliance with this section and this Zoning Ordinance. For purposes of this chapter, landscaped area shall be defined under the “Landscaping Standards” definitions of Article 7 (Glossary).

1.    To conserve water, the installation of water-efficient and/or drought-tolerant landscape materials is strongly encouraged. Where projects are subject to the state Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance (Title 23 California Code of Regulations Section 490 et seq.), drought-tolerant and water-efficient landscaping and irrigation systems shall be installed in compliance with the provisions of the model ordinance.

2.    New hardscapes installed on a site as part of a development project not included as pervious site landscaping should be designed as semi-impervious hardscape or direct stormwater runoff to retention or infiltration points on the site.

C.    Landscaping standards.

1.    Minimum dimensions. Each area of landscaping shall have a minimum interior width of five feet within the residential and commercial zones.

a.    These dimensions may be reduced where the review authority determines they are infeasible because of limited site area.

b.    Wherever this Zoning Ordinance requires a landscaped area of a specified width, the width shall be measured within any curb or wall bordering the landscaping area.

2.    Protective curbing. Required landscaping shall be protected with a minimum six-inch-high concrete curb, except where adjacent to sidewalks, unimproved paths, bioswales or other low-impact development features, bicycle paths, or where otherwise deemed unnecessary by the Zoning Administrator to allow for stormwater discharge into landscaping areas.

3.    Safety requirements. Landscape materials shall be located so that at maturity they do not:

a.    Interfere with safe sight distances for bicycle, pedestrian, or vehicular traffic;

b.    Conflict with overhead lights, utility lines, or walkway lights; or

c.    Block bicycle or pedestrian ways.

4.    Lawns. Lawns shall be limited to 50 percent of the total landscaped area on the site except where the applicant provides evidence, approved by the Board of Architectural Review, which demonstrates that the irrigation requirements of a larger lawn area will not exceed standard low water usage as established by the designated water district regulations for the site.

a.    Lawns shall be prohibited:

(1)    In any area of five feet or less in width; or

(2)    On any slope exceeding 10 percent (25 percent, where other project water-saving techniques compensate for the increased runoff). A level buffer zone of 18 inches shall be provided between bermed lawn areas and any hardscape (e.g., any street, walkway, or similar feature).

b.    The Board of Architectural Review may modify these requirements when it finds that water-saving techniques are applied or modifications to these standards would not cause excessive water use or increased runoff.

5.    Water features. Decorative water features (e.g., fountains, ponds, waterfalls) shall have recirculating water systems.

6.     Parking lots. See Section 17.34.110 (landscaping of parking lots).

7.    Trees.

a.    All trees shall be adequately supported when planted. The supports shall be maintained until the trees are capable of withstanding the force of wind on their own and removed before damage could potentially occur to the tree trunk.

b.    Tree root barriers shall be installed, as required by the City Engineer, where trees are placed within five feet of public improvements including walks, curbs, or street pavement or where new public improvements are placed adjacent to existing trees. The Board of Architectural Review may waive this requirement where the combination of soil conditions, root zone area, adjacent improvements, and selected tree species can be demonstrated to provide conditions for healthy tree growth that will not damage public improvements.

D.    Screening requirements. See Subsection 17.30.020.G (Screening requirements).

E.    Visual obstructions.

1.    Landscaping that is primarily intended or designed for fencing purposes within a required front setback area or is located within a traffic safety visibility area (see Subsection 17.30.030.E, Height limit within traffic safety visibility areas) shall not be allowed to exceed the maximum height within the traffic safety visibility area as established under Tables 3-1 and 3-2, as measured from the top of the existing or proposed street curb. See also height limits for hedges and screening under Section 17.30.020 for additional standards.

F.    Street tree requirements. The installation of street trees in the public right-of-way or on private streets may be required as a condition of approval by the Planning Commission or Board of Architectural Review in compliance with the following standards:

1.    Location.

a.    Street trees shall be planted in the public right-of-way where street trees are planned for installation under the City’s current Capital Improvement Program or an adopted specific plan or Master Plan on a private street between the street curb and abutting property line or as otherwise directed by the City Engineer.

b.    Exception: Where site conditions do not allow the installation of the street trees as established by this section, trees may be located on private property within 10 feet of the property line along the street frontage.

2.    Quantity.

a.    The number of required street trees shall be calculated at the rate of one 15-gallon tree for every 30 feet of street frontage.

b.    The installed tree spacing may be varied to accommodate site conditions or design considerations; however, the number of trees required for each street frontage on a lot bounded by more than one street shall be planted along the corresponding street frontage.

c.    Where palm trees are proposed to satisfy this requirement, they shall be planted at a rate of one 10-foot brown trunk height palm for each 20 feet of street frontage.

d.    The City Engineer may modify the number of required street trees for a project on a case-by-case basis.

3.    A tree proposed, or required, to replace an existing mature specimen tree shall be transplanted from a minimum 24-inch box.

4.    Protection.

a.    All trees shall be adequately supported when planted. The supports shall be maintained until the trees are capable of withstanding the force of wind on their own.

b.    Where existing trees are required to be preserved, protective fencing shall be in place prior to the issuance of a Building Permit, and all new development shall be designed in a manner which respects the current drip lines.

5.    Solar access. When trees are incorporated into an approved landscaping plan, they shall be planted in a manner which maximizes the provision of sunlight to nearby windows and/or solar collectors situated on site or on an adjoining property.

G.    Irrigation system requirements.

1.    All landscaped areas except those approved for maintenance with intentionally unirrigated native plants shall include an automatic irrigation system.

2.    Water-efficient systems (e.g., bubbler-type, drip, mini-spray, or similar system) shall be used unless infeasible. Low-flow sprinkler heads with matched precipitation rates shall be used when spray or rotor-type heads are specified for watering shrubs and ground cover areas. Lawn areas shall be sized and shaped so they can be efficiently irrigated. Spray or runoff onto paved areas shall be avoided.

3.    Dual or multi-program controllers with separated valves and circuits shall be used when the project contains more than one type of landscape treatment (e.g., ground cover, lawn, shrub, tree areas) or a variety of solar aspects. Soil moisture-sensing devices and rain sensors shall be used on larger projects (50,000 plus square feet of landscaped area) to minimize or eliminate overwatering.

4.    Watering shall be scheduled at times of minimal wind conflict and evaporation loss.

5.    Sprinkler heads shall have matched precipitation rates within each valve zone.

6.    Check valves are required where elevation differential may cause low head drainage.

H.    Responsibility of the Board of Architectural Review.

1.    The Board of Architectural Review shall be primarily responsible for the review and approval of landscape plans and improvements within the City in compliance with Subsection 17.62.030.B (Applicability).

2.    Prior to Building Permit issuance, all projects that require approval of landscape and/or irrigation plans shall receive Board of Architectural Review approval.

I.    Changes to approved landscape plans. The Director may authorize minor changes to Board of Architectural Review approved landscape and irrigation plans where the Director can make the findings outlined in Section 17.64.090 (Changes to an approved project).

1.    For purposes of this section, minor changes shall be defined as changes to the landscaping plans that are not visible and do not affect the theme or character established for the subject development project.

2.    If the Director determines that a requested change does not comply with the definition of minor in Subsection J.1 of this section, the requested change may only be approved by the review authority that originally approved the landscaping plans, in accordance with Section 17.64.090 (Changes to an approved project).

J.    Statement of surety. When required by the Zoning Administrator, security in the form of cash, performance bond, letter of credit, or instrument of credit, in an amount equal to 150 percent of the total value of all plant materials, irrigation, installation, and maintenance shall be posted with the City for a two-year period in compliance with Section 17.64.070 (Performance guarantees). The Zoning Administrator may require statements of surety for phased development projects, a legitimate delay in landscape installation due to seasonal requirements (including adverse weather conditions), and similar circumstances where it may not be advisable or desirable to install all approved landscaping before occupancy of the site.

K.    Installation and inspection before occupancy. All landscaping approved by the Board of Architectural Review, in accordance with the applicability of Section 17.62.030 (Architectural review), shall be installed and inspected by a representative of the Planning Division before the City will allow occupancy of any structure or authorize the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.

L.    Maintenance.

1.    Landscape maintenance.

a.    All landscaping (e.g., ground cover, hedges, lawns, shrubs, and trees) shall be maintained in a healthful and thriving condition at all times, and free of weeds, debris, and deceased plants.

b.    Landscaping located in a traffic safety visibility area shall be maintained in accordance with Subsection 17.30.030.E (Height limit within traffic safety visibility areas).

c.    Trees required by this section shall be maintained so that all branches over pedestrian walkways are six feet above the walkway grade and so that all branches over vehicular travel ways are 16 feet above the grade of the travelway. All pruning shall comply with the standards of the National Arborist Association.

d.    Deceased plant materials must be removed and replaced within one month with the same species and size specified in the Board of Architectural Review approved plans.

Exceptions: Trees that die three years or more after installation, or trees that are “topped,” shall be replaced by a minimum 24-inch box size container of the same species specified on the approved plans. Other types of plants that die three years or more after installation shall be replaced with a specimen two container sizes larger than that specified on the approved plans.

e.    All fences and walls which have been incorporated into an approved landscaping plan shall regularly be maintained in an attractive and safe manner.

2.    Irrigation system maintenance.

a.    Irrigation systems and their components shall be maintained in a fully functional manner consistent with the originally approved design and the provisions of this section.

b.    Regular maintenance shall include checking, adjusting, and repairing irrigation equipment; resetting automatic controllers; aerating and dethatching lawn areas; adding/replenishing mulch, fertilizer, and soil amendments; and mowing, pruning, trimming, and watering all landscaped areas.

c.    Watering shall be scheduled at times of minimal wind conflict and evaporation loss.

d.    All fences and walls which have been incorporated into an approved landscaping plan shall regularly be maintained in an attractive and safe manner.

3.    Maintenance agreement required. Before final inspection or occupancy, and before the recordation of a final subdivision map where applicable, the applicant shall enter into a landscape maintenance agreement with the City to guarantee proper maintenance in compliance with Subsection L.1 of this section. The form and content of the agreement shall be approved by the City Attorney and the Zoning Administrator.

4.    Water waste prohibited. Water waste in existing developments resulting from inefficient landscape irrigation leading to excessive runoff, low head drainage, overspray, and other similar conditions where water flows onto adjacent property, nonirrigated areas, walks, roadways, or structures is prohibited.

5.    Enforcement. Failure to maintain landscape areas in compliance with this section shall be deemed a public nuisance, and shall be subject to abatement in compliance with the Municipal Code, and/or the applicable planning permit may be revoked in compliance with Chapter 17.80 (Enforcement and Penalties). (Ord. 1025 §§ 10, 11, 2015)


17.30.050 Moved Structures

A.    Minimum standards. No structure, whether in use or formerly used for residential, commercial or industrial purposes, shall be physically moved from a parcel within the City, or from a parcel outside the City to a parcel within the City, unless the structure and its placement on a parcel of record complies with all minimum requirements of the applicable zone.

B.    Permit requirements.

1.    A Minor Use Permit application, filed in compliance with Section 17.62.070, shall be required to move a structure within the City.

2.    Upon the filing of an application to move a structure, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the application to the City’s Building Official.

3.    The Building Official shall request an inspection of the structure to be moved by a qualified individual who will prepare a report at the expense of the applicant for the moved structure concerning the integrity of the structure and any improvements which will be required to be made.

4.    The Building Official may recommend denial of a Minor Use Permit if, in the Building Official’s opinion, the age, condition, or construction of the structure to be moved raises doubts as to its structural integrity or if the proposed structure to be moved is sufficiently heavy to cause damage to any street or pavement within the City.

C.    Findings required for approval. The approval of a Minor Use Permit for a moved structure shall require that the Zoning Administrator first find, in addition to the findings required by Section 17.62.070, that moving the structure will have no detrimental effect on the living environment of the surrounding neighborhood or upon property values within the neighborhood. In making this determination, the Zoning Administrator may choose to refer any architectural plans for the structure to the Board of Architectural Review for review and comment.


17.30.060 Noise Standards

A.    Purpose. This section implements the policies of the Noise Element of the General Plan, and provides noise mitigation standards that are intended to protect the community health, safety, and general welfare by limiting exposure to the unhealthful effects of noise.

B.    Applicability. No use, activity, or process shall exceed the maximum allowable noise levels established by this section, except for the following noise sources:

1.    Emergencies. Public safety warning devices (e.g., ambulance, fire, and police sirens), sound for alerting persons to the existence of an emergency, or the performance of authorized emergency work;

2.    Parks. Public agency sanctioned recreational activities and programs conducted in public parks;

3.    Public health and safety activities. Construction, maintenance, and/or repair operations by public agencies and/or utility companies or their contractors that are serving public interests and/or protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare;

4.    State or federal preempted activities. Any activity regulated by state or federal law; and

5.    Solid waste collection. The authorized collection of solid waste and recyclable materials.

C.    General standard. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly make, continue, or cause to be made or continued, any excessive, unnecessary, or unusually loud noise. More specifically, and in compliance with Section 9.12.030 (Specific prohibitions) of the Municipal Code, loud noise shall be prohibited before 7:00 a.m. or after 7:00 p.m. daily (except Saturday, Sunday, and holidays when the prohibited time shall be before 9:00 a.m. and after 7:00 p.m.).

D.    Municipal Code compliance required. Chapter 9.12 (Noise Regulations) of the Municipal Code shall also regulate the noise generated from all uses, activities, and processes conducted within the City.

E.    Noise source standards.

1.    Stationary and transportation source noise level limitations.

a.    No use, activity, or process within the City shall generate noise in excess of the levels identified by Tables 3-3 (Maximum Interior and Exterior Noise Standards) and 3-4 (Noise/Land Use Compatibility Matrix), as the noise is measured at the property line of a noise sensitive land use identified in Tables 3-3 and 3-4 at a height where a person is reasonably expected to be (e.g., ground level, upper floor balcony).

(1)    If the measured ambient noise level exceeds the applicable noise level standard in any category shown in the tables, the applicable standards shall be deemed to equal the ambient noise level.

(2)    If the noise source being evaluated is continuous and cannot reasonably be discontinued or stopped to allow measurement of the ambient noise level, the noise level measured while the source is in operation shall be compared directly to the applicable noise level standards identified in the tables.

b.    Notwithstanding the above requirements, no person shall allow or cause the generation of any noise of a duration, pitch, repetition, tone, type, or volume that would be found to be a nuisance by a reasonable person beyond the boundaries of the property where the noise is generated.

Notes:

A =    Normally Acceptable – Specified land use is satisfactory based on the assumption that any structures involved are normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.

B =    Conditionally Acceptable – New construction or development may be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise requirements is made and needed noise insulation features as included in the design. Conventional construction, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.

C =    Normally Unacceptable – New construction or development shall generally be discouraged. If it does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements shall be made and needed noise insulation features included in the design.

– =    Clearly Unacceptable – New construction or development shall generally not be undertaken.

2.    Intrusive noise. When intrusive noise sources have been identified through project review, the review authority shall require that the detrimental effects (sleep interference or the potential for annoyance) be disclosed to neighboring receptor properties.

3.    Rhythmic, recurring, or impulsive noise sources. When noise sources have been identified to be rhythmic, reoccurring, or impulsive in nature or comprised mainly of music or speech, they may comply with applicable noise level criteria and still be annoying to individuals. These types of noise sources have been identified, they may be subject to additional mitigation or mediation, and shall be subject to the criteria in Table 3-3, with a –5 dB penalty applied to the criteria.

F.    Standards for sensitive receptors. New noise-sensitive land uses as identified in Table 3-3 (Maximum Interior and Exterior Noise Standards) shall not be allowed where the noise level from existing nontransportation noise generators will exceed the noise level standards in Table 3-4, or where projected levels of transportation noise will exceed the levels specified in Table 3-4, unless effective noise mitigation measures are incorporated into project design to maintain outdoor and indoor noise levels on the receptor site in compliance with Tables 3-3 and 3-4.

1.    New noise-sensitive uses. New construction and retrofits at existing structures shall include appropriate insulation, glazing, and other sound attenuation measures so that they comply with the standards in Table 3-3 (Maximum Interior and Exterior Noise Standards).

2.    Mitigation required. Noise that may affect a proposed noise-sensitive land use shall be mitigated to not exceed the noise level standards in Table 3-3 (Maximum Interior and Exterior Noise Standards) at the property line of any noise-sensitive land use identified in Table 3-3. Appropriate mitigation measures include:

a.    Noise attenuation measures, and stationary noise source controls shall include the use of baffles, barriers, enclosures, setbacks, silencers, site design, and improved facade construction techniques.

b.    Where noise mitigation measures are required, mitigation shall occur primarily through site planning and project design, where feasible. The use of noise barriers shall be considered a means of achieving the noise standards only after all other practical design-related noise mitigation measures have been integrated into the project.

G.    Acoustical analysis. Where the Zoning Administrator determines that a proposed project is a noise-sensitive land use, or may generate noise in excess of any limit established by Tables 3-3 (Maximum Interior and Exterior Noise Standards) or 3-4 (Noise/Land Use Compatibility Matrix) and/or where the use may generate noise in outdoor areas in excess of 60 dBA, the planning permit application for the use shall include an acoustical analysis, which shall:

1.    Be the financial responsibility of the applicant;

2.    Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment and architectural acoustics;

3.    Include noise level measurements, with sufficient sampling periods and locations, to adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources;

4.    Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20-year) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or the standards of Table 3-3 (Maximum Interior and Exterior Noise Standards) and compare those levels to the requirements of this section and the policies of the Noise Element;

5.    Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with this section and the policies and standards of the Noise Element, giving preference to proper site planning and design over mitigation measures which require the construction of noise barriers or structural modifications to structures that contain noise-sensitive land uses;

6.    Estimate noise exposure after prescribed mitigation measures are implemented; and

7.    Describe a post-project assessment program that may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures.

H.    Noise measurement. Exterior noise levels shall be measured at the property line of the noise-sensitive land use receiving the noise. Noise measurement shall be made with a sound level meter using the A- weighted scale at slow meter response. Fast meter response shall be used only for an impulsive noise.


17.30.070 Outdoor Lighting

Outdoor lighting on the site of a multi-family or nonresidential structure or use shall comply with the following requirements:

A.    Maximum height. A freestanding outdoor light fixture shall be limited to a maximum height of 16 feet, measured from adjacent normal grade to the top of the fixture(s). The fixture shall be considered to be the highest portion of the light structure. When not located adjacent to a single-family residential zone, the Board of Architectural Review may grant exceptions to the maximum height of freestanding outdoor light fixture(s) with the finding that the proposed height is consistent with surrounding land uses and is compatible with the existing or proposed surrounding structures. Exceptions to the maximum height should not be made by the Board for proposed freestanding lights that are adjacent to single-family residential zones.

B.    Energy efficiency. Outdoor lighting shall utilize energy-efficient (high pressure sodium, low pressure sodium, hard-wired compact fluorescent, LED, or other lighting technology that is of equal or greater energy efficiency) fixtures and lamps.

C.    Position of light fixtures. All lighting fixtures shall be properly directed, recessed, and fully shielded (e.g., downward and away from adjoining properties) to reduce light bleed and glare onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way, by:

1.    Ensuring that the light source (e.g., bulb, etc.) is not visible from off the site; and

2.    Confining glare and reflections within the boundaries of the subject site to the maximum extent feasible.

D.    Maximum illumination. No lighting on private property shall produce an illumination level greater than one foot-candle on any property within a residential zone except on the site of the light source.

E.    Backlighting, Uplighting and Glare (BUG) rating. All outdoor light fixtures are subject to the BUG rating limits established by the California Energy Code (CALGreen 5.106.8) prior to the issuance of an electrical permit.

F.    No blinking, flashing, or high intensity. No permanently installed lighting shall blink, flash, flutter, or be of unusually high intensity or brightness, or change light brightness, color, or intensity, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.

G.    New light fixtures on commercial buildings. Installation of new light fixtures on commercial buildings shall be subject to review and approval by the Board of Architectural Review.

17.30.090 Public Improvement Requirements

The development of an approved project shall include the construction of improvements to each public street frontage of the site as required by the review authority in accordance with approved City Engineering Standards and as approved by the City Engineer. These on-site and/or off-site improvements may include the widening of an existing street and/or the installation or reinstallation of curb, gutter, and sidewalk; the installation of street trees and other landscaping within the public right-of-way; the installation of traffic control devices; the installation of drainage facilities as required by the City Engineer, and/or other improvements determined by the review authority to be reasonably related to the needs for pedestrian and vehicle circulation, and community infrastructure demands created by the project. See also Section 17.30.120 (Underground Utilities).


17.30.100 Setback Requirements and Exceptions

A.    Purpose. This section provides standards for the location, required size, and allowable uses of setbacks. Setback standards provide open areas around structures for access to and around structures; access to natural light, ventilation and direct sunlight; separation between potentially conflicting activities; space for privacy, landscaping and recreation; and visibility and traffic safety.

B.    Setback requirements.

1.    Minimum setbacks for all structures.

a.    Each structure shall comply with the front, interior side, street side, and rear setback requirements of the applicable zone, except:

(1)    Where a different setback requirement is established for a specific land use by Article 4 (Standards for Specific Land Uses); or

(2)    As otherwise provided by this section.

b.    No portion of any structure, including eaves or roof overhangs, shall extend beyond a property line, or into an access easement or street right-of-way, except as provided by this section.

2.    Exemptions from setback requirements. The minimum setback requirements of this Zoning Ordinance do not apply to the following:

a.    An architectural projection into a required setback allowed by Subsection E of this section (Allowed projections into setbacks).

b.    A fence or wall six feet or less in height, when located outside of a front, street side setback, or traffic safety visibility area.

c.    Any detached deck, earthwork, step, terrace, and other site design element that is placed directly upon grade and does not exceed a height of 18 inches above the surrounding grade at any point; with the exception of encroachments into the front setback (see Subsection F.2.a of this section). See also Section 17.52.220 (Residential Accessory Buildings, Structures, and Uses) for accessory structure standards.

d.    A sign in compliance with Chapter 17.40 (Signs).

e.    A retaining wall less than 30 inches in height above finished grade. Refer to Subsection D.3 of this section (Retaining Walls) for retaining wall height requirements.

C.    Measurement of setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured and applied as follows, except that the Zoning Administrator may require different setback measurement methods where the Zoning Administrator determines that unusual parcel configuration makes the following infeasible or ineffective (see Figure 3-8):


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-8 – Location & Measurement of Setbacks

1.    Front setback. A front setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the front property line of the parcel (or edge of access easement on a private street) to the nearest point of the wall of the structure, except as modified below. The front property line shall be determined from the street frontage from which the property takes its street address and/or the property line to which the primary building entry faces. The Zoning Administrator, in consultation with the Building Official, shall determine the location of the front property line when in question.

a.    Mapped street with plan line. If the City has established a plan line that identifies a right-of-way for the future construction of a new street or the widening of an existing street, a required front or street side setback shall be measured from the plan line.

b.    Infill development within previously approved project. Where the City has established specific setback requirements for individual vacant parcels through the approval of a specific plan, subdivision map, or other entitlement, those setbacks shall apply to development within the approved project instead of the setbacks required by this Zoning Ordinance.

c.    Flag lot. For a parcel with a fee ownership strip extending from a street or right-of-way to the building area of the parcel, the front setback shall be measured from the nearest point of the wall of the structure to the point where the access strip meets the bulk of the parcel, establishing a setback line parallel to the lot line nearest to the public street or right-of-way.

2.    Side setback. The side setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the side property line of the parcel to the nearest point of the wall of the structure, establishing a setback line parallel to the side property line, which extends between the front and rear setbacks.

3.    Street side setback. The side setback on the street side of a corner parcel shall be measured from the nearest point on the side property line bounding the street, or the edge of an easement for a private road, edge of a right-of-way, or the inside edge of the sidewalk, or a plan line established as described in Subsection C.1.b of this section, whichever results in the greatest setback from the existing or future roadway.

4.    Rear setback. The rear setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the rear property line opposite the front property line, to the nearest line of the structure, establishing a setback line parallel to the rear property line.

a.    The Zoning Administrator shall determine the location of the required rear setback on a double-frontage parcel.

b.    Where a parcel has no rear lot line because its side lot lines converge to a point, an assumed line five feet long within the parcel, parallel to, and at a maximum distance from the front lot line, shall be deemed to be the rear lot line for the purpose of determining the depth of the required rear setback.

D.    Limitations on the use of setbacks.

1.    Mechanical and utility equipment. See Subsection F.4 of this section (Setback requirements for specific structures).

2.    Parking. Required covered and uncovered residential parking spaces shall not be located within required front or street side setback areas. Temporary (overnight) parking is allowable within required front and street side setback areas only on paved, concrete, or hard permeable surface driveways. See also Subsection 17.33.090.C (Location of parking).

a.    Required residential parking spaces may be located within a required side or rear setback area, provided they are separated from the side or rear property line by a minimum three-foot-wide landscaped buffer other than the side used for vehicle access and are not located within any traffic safety visibility area in accordance with Subsection 17.30.030.E (Height limit within traffic safety visibility areas); the three-foot-wide landscape buffer shall not apply to an uncovered parking space located within a rear setback area which abuts an alley and is screened from the alley with a six-foot fence.

b.    Parking spaces located within a detached garage or carport shall be subject to the minimum setback for an accessory structure in compliance with Section 17.52.220 (Residential Accessory Buildings, Structures, and Uses).

c.    Parking of other than passenger vehicles shall comply with the setback requirements of Section 17.34.150 (Parking of Other Than Passenger Vehicles).

3.    Storage. No front or street side setback shall be used for the accumulation, placement, or storage of automobiles or other motor vehicles, storage containers/metal boxes, building materials, junk, machinery, or scrap, except for the following:

a.    Automobiles and trucks, not in excess of one-ton capacity, regularly in use, that are parked on a designated driveway composed of concrete, asphalt, pavers or other surface approved by the Zoning Administrator.

b.    A single recreational vehicle or boat may be allowed when stored in the rear yard or outside of a required front, side, or street side setback, and when screened by a six-foot-tall fence and/or landscaping element. See also Section 17.34.150 (Parking of Other than Passenger Vehicles).

c.    Building materials required for construction on the parcel immediately before and during a construction project which has a valid Building Permit in force.

4.    Storage of trailers in nonresidential zones prohibited. No trailer shall be stored or parked within any required front or street side setback area in any nonresidential zoning district except where limited display areas are authorized through Minor Use Permit approval in compliance with Section 17.62.070.

5.    Structures. A required setback area shall not be occupied by a structure other than those identified by Subsection B.2 of this section, and as specified under Chapter 17.52 (Standards for Specific Land Uses).

E.    Allowed architectural projections into setbacks. Where allowed in the applicable zone by Article 2 (Zones, Permitted Land Uses, and Zoning Standards), an architectural feature attached to a primary structure may extend beyond the wall of the structure and into a required front, side, street side, or rear setback in compliance with Table 3-5. See also Figure 3-8. These requirements do not apply to residential second units, which are instead regulated by Section 17.52.220 (Residential Accessory Buildings, Structures, and Uses), or accessory structures, which are regulated by Section 17.52.220 (Residential Accessory Buildings, Structures, and Uses).

17.32.100    Adjustments, Waivers

17.32.110    Enforcement


17.32.010 Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to:

A.    Encourage the development and availability of housing affordable to a broad range of households with varying income levels within City as mandated by Government Code Section 65580 et seq.;

B.    Offset the demand for affordable housing created by new development, and mitigate environmental and other impacts that accompany new development by protecting the economic diversity of the City’s housing stock, reducing traffic, transit and related air quality impacts, promoting jobs/housing balance, and reducing the demands placed on transportation infrastructure in the region;

C.    Implement the policies of the Housing Element of the General Plan.


17.32.020 Applicability

A.    Inclusionary requirement. Each residential development, including a condominium conversion, shall be designed and constructed to provide at least 20 percent of the total units as inclusionary units restricted for occupancy by moderate-, low- or very low-income households. The number of inclusionary units required for a particular project will be determined only once, at the time of Tentative Map or Parcel Map approval, or for developments not processing a map at the time of Use Permit approval, or prior to issuance of a Building Permit. If a change in the subdivision design changes the total number of units, the number of inclusionary units required will be recalculated to coincide with the final approved project.

1.    Calculation. For purposes of calculating the number of affordable units required by this section, any additional units authorized as a density bonus in compliance with Chapter 17.33 (Affordable Housing Incentives) will not be counted in determining the required number of inclusionary units. In determining the number of whole inclusionary units required, any decimal fraction less than 0.5 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and any decimal fraction of 0.5 or more shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

2.    Limitations on occupancy. The first one-third of the required inclusionary units shall be restricted to occupancy by low-income households. The second third of the inclusionary units shall be restricted to occupancy by very low-income households. To encourage additional development of low- and very low-income housing, the Council may authorize the use of the following equivalents:

a.    Each very low-income unit is equivalent to two units affordable to moderate-income households; and

b.    Each low-income unit is equivalent to 1.5 units affordable to moderate-income households.

B.    Minimum requirements. The requirements of this chapter are minimum and maximum requirements, although nothing in this chapter limits the ability of a person to waive their rights or voluntarily undertake greater obligations than those imposed by this chapter.


17.32.030 Exemptions

The requirements of this chapter do not apply to:

A.    The reconstruction of a structure that has been destroyed by fire, flood, earthquake or other act of nature; provided, that reconstruction does not increase the number of residential units; or

B.    A development that already has more units that qualify as affordable to moderate-, low- and very low-income households than this chapter requires; or

C.    Housing constructed by a government agency; or

D.    A second unit.


17.32.040 Standards for Inclusionary Units

Each inclusionary unit built in compliance with this chapter shall comply with the following standards:

A.    Location of inclusionary units. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, inclusionary units shall be dispersed throughout a residential development.

B.    Design. Inclusionary units shall be comparable in infrastructure (including sewer, water and other utilities), construction quality and exterior design to the market-rate units. Inclusionary units may be smaller in aggregate size and have different interior finishes and features than market-rate units so long as the interior features are durable, of good quality and consistent with contemporary standards for new housing. The number of bedrooms shall be the same as those in the market-rate units, except that if the market-rate units provide more than four bedrooms, the inclusionary units need not provide more than four bedrooms.

C.    Timing of construction. All required inclusionary units shall be constructed and occupied concurrently with or prior to the construction and occupancy of the associated market-rate units or development. In a phased development, the inclusionary units may be constructed and occupied in proportion to the number of units in each phase of the residential development; provided, that the last inclusionary unit in the project shall be constructed before the last market-rate unit.

D.    Duration of affordability requirement. Each inclusionary unit produced in compliance with this chapter shall be legally restricted to occupancy by households of the income levels for which the unit was designated, for a minimum of 40 years from the date of first occupancy for rental units, and for a minimum of 40 years from the date of each sale of any affordable unit for owner occupied units. (Additional affordability requirements may apply in compliance with state redevelopment law (Health and Safety Code Section 33413(c).)


17.32.050 Compliance Procedures

A.    General. Approval of an inclusionary housing plan and implementation of a City approved inclusionary housing agreement is a condition of any Tentative Map, Parcel Map, Use Permit, or Building Permit for any development for which this chapter applies. This section does not apply to an exempt project.

B.    Inclusionary Housing Plan. No application for a Tentative Map, Parcel Map, Use Permit, or Building Permit to which this chapter applies shall be deemed complete until an Inclusionary Housing Plan is submitted with the application. At any time during the review process, the City may require from the developer additional information reasonably necessary to clarify and supplement the application or determine the consistency of the proposed Inclusionary Housing Plan with the requirements of this chapter. The Inclusionary Housing Plan must include:

1.    The location, structure (attached, semi-attached, or detached), whether for sale or rental, size of the proposed market-rate and inclusionary units, and the basis for calculating the number of inclusionary units;

2.    A floor or site plan showing the location of the inclusionary units;

3.    The income levels to which each inclusionary unit will be made affordable;

4.    For phased development, a phasing plan that provides for the timely development of the number of inclusionary units proportionate to each proposed phase of development as required by Subsection 17.32.040.C (Standards for Inclusionary Units – Timing of construction).

5.    Any alternative means designated in Subsection 17.32.060.A (Alternatives – Developer proposal) proposed for the development along with information necessary to support the findings required by Subsection 17.32.060.B (Alternatives – Discretion) for approval of the alternatives; and

6.    Any other information reasonably requested by the City to assist with evaluation of the plan in compliance with the standards of this chapter.

C.    Inclusionary Housing Agreement. The Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall use the form provided by the City. The contents of the agreement may vary depending on the manner in which the provisions of this chapter are satisfied for a particular development. Each Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall include, at minimum, the following:

1.    Description of the development, including whether the inclusionary units will be rented or owner-occupied;

2.    The number, size and location of very low-, low- or moderate-income units;

3.    Provisions and/or documents for resale restrictions, deeds of trust, rights of first refusal or rental restrictions;

4.    Provisions for monitoring the ongoing affordability of the units, and the process for qualifying prospective resident households for income eligibility; and

5.    Any additional obligations relevant to the compliance with this chapter.

D.    Recording of agreement. Each Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall be recorded against owner-occupied inclusionary units and residential projects containing rental inclusionary units, as applicable. Additional rental or resale restrictions, deeds of trust, rights of first refusal, and/or other documents acceptable to the City shall also be recorded against owner-occupied inclusionary units. In cases where the requirements of this chapter are satisfied through the development of off-site units, the Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall simultaneously be recorded against the property where the off-site units are to be developed.


17.32.060 Alternatives

A.    Developer proposal. A developer may propose an alternative means of compliance in an Inclusionary Housing Plan as provided in Subsection 17.32.050.B as follows:

1.    Off-site construction. Units may be constructed off-site if the inclusionary units will be located in an area where, based on the availability of affordable housing, the review authority finds that the need for such units is greater than the need in the area of the proposed development.

2.    Land dedication. In lieu of building inclusionary units, a developer may choose to dedicate land to the City suitable for the construction of inclusionary units that the review authority reasonably determines to be of equivalent or greater value than is produced by applying the inclusionary obligation.

3.    Combination. The review authority may accept any combination of on-site construction, off-site construction, in-lieu fees and land dedication that at least equal the cost of providing inclusionary units on site as would otherwise be required by this chapter. The value of a proposed land dedication shall be determined by an appraiser appointed by the City.

B.    Discretion. The review authority may approve, conditionally approve, or reject any alternative proposed by a developer as part of an Inclusionary Housing Plan. Any approval or conditional approval shall be based on a finding that the purposes of this chapter would be better served by implementation of the proposed alternatives. In determining whether the purposes of this chapter would be better served under the proposed alternative, the review authority should consider:

1.    Whether implementation of an alternative would overly concentrate inclusionary units within any specific area and, if so, must reject the alternative unless the undesirable concentration of inclusionary units is offset by other identified benefits that flow from implementation of the alternative in issue; and

2.    The extent to which other factors affect the feasibility of prompt construction of the inclusionary units on the property, such as costs and delays, the need for an appraisal, site design, zoning, infrastructure, clear title, grading and environmental review.


17.32.070 Eligibility for Occupying Inclusionary Units

A.    General eligibility. No household may occupy an inclusionary unit unless the City or its designee has approved the household’s eligibility, or has failed to make a determination of eligibility within the time or other limits provided by an Inclusionary Housing Agreement or resale restriction. If the City or its designee maintains a list or identifies eligible households, initial and subsequent occupants will be selected first from the list of identified households, to the maximum extent possible, in compliance with any rules approved by the City.

B.    Occupancy. A household who occupies a rental inclusionary unit or purchases an inclusionary unit shall occupy the unit as a principal residence.


17.32.080 Owner-Occupied Units

A.    Initial sales price. The initial sales price of the inclusionary unit must be set so that the eligible household will pay an affordable ownership cost.

B.    Transfer. Renewed restrictions will be entered into on each change of ownership, with a 40-year renewal term, upon transfer of an owner-occupied inclusionary unit prior to the expiration of the 40-year affordability period.

C.    Resale. The maximum sales price permitted on resale of an inclusionary unit designated for owner occupancy shall be the lower of:

1.    Fair market value; or

2.    The seller’s lawful purchase price, increased by the lesser of:

a.    The rate of increase of area median income during the seller’s ownership; or

b.    The rate at which the consumer price index increased during the seller’s ownership.

To the extent authorized in any resale restrictions or operative Inclusionary Housing Agreement, sellers may recover at time of sale the market value of capital improvements made by the seller and the seller’s necessary and usual costs of sale, and may authorize an increase in the maximum allowable sales price to achieve such recovery.

D.    Change in title. The following requirements apply in the event of a change in circumstance, including death, marriage, and divorce, that may occur prior to the expiration of the required affordability period:

1.    Upon the death of one of the owners, title in the property may transfer to the surviving joint tenant, tenant in common, or community property holder, without respect to the income eligibility of the household.

2.    Upon the death of a sole owner or all owners, and inheritance of the inclusionary unit by a non-income-eligible inheritee, there will be a one year compassion period between the time when the estate is settled and the time when the property must be sold to an income-eligible household. A non-eligible inheritee may request and the Council may waive this requirement on the basis of hardships specified by the Council. Alternatively, the Council may authorize their continued ownership with the unit rented at an affordable rate to an eligible household.


17.32.090 Rental Units

A.    Eligibility of tenants. The owner of rental inclusionary units shall be responsible for certifying the income of the tenant to the Director at the time of initial rental, and annually thereafter. This shall be completed by viewing acceptable documentation, including income tax statements or a W-2 for the previous calendar year, and submitting, on a form approved by the City, a certification that the tenant qualifies as an income eligible household.

B.    Selection of tenants. The owner of rental inclusionary units shall fill vacant units by either:

1.    Selecting income-eligible households themselves as long as the owner complies with the publication requirements in Subsection C of this section (Publication of availability of units).

2.    Selecting income-eligible households from the City’s Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Waiting List available from the Department.

C.    Publication of availability of units. Whenever an inclusionary unit becomes available, the owner shall publish notices of the availability of the inclusionary unit in newspapers circulated widely in the City, including newspapers that reach minority communities. The notice should briefly explain what inclusionary housing is, state the applicable income requirements, indicate where applications are available, state when the application period opens and closes, and provide a telephone number for questions. Applications may require the name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; the number of persons to occupy the household; and any other information relevant to determine whether the applicant is eligible to occupy an inclusionary unit. The owner shall submit proof of publication to the Director.

D.    Notification to City. Whenever an inclusionary unit becomes available, the owner shall immediately notify the Director in writing.

E.    Subsequent rental to income-eligible tenant. The owner of rental inclusionary units shall apply the same rental terms and conditions to tenants of inclusionary units as are applied to all other tenants, except as otherwise required to comply with this chapter (i.e., rent levels, occupancy restrictions, and income requirements) and/or government subsidy programs. Discrimination based on subsidies received by the prospective tenant is prohibited.

F.    Changes in tenant income. If after moving into an inclusionary unit the tenant’s income eventually exceeds the income limit for that unit, the tenant may remain in the unit (the “original unit”) as long as his/her income does not exceed 140 percent of the income limit for the original unit. Once the tenant’s income exceeds 140 percent of the income limit for the original unit, the following shall apply:

1.    If the tenant’s income does not exceed the income limits of other inclusionary units in the residential development, the owner may, at the owner’s option, allow the tenant to remain in the original unit at the tenant’s new applicable affordable housing cost, as long as the next vacant unit is redesignated for the same lower-income category applicable to the original unit. If the owner does not want to redesignate the next vacant unit, the tenant shall be given one year’s notice to vacate the unit. If during the year, an inclusionary unit becomes available and the tenant meets the income eligibility for that unit, the owner shall provide the tenant with the opportunity to submit an application for that unit.

2.    If there are no units designated for a higher income category within the residential development that may be substituted for the original unit, the tenant shall be given one year’s notice to vacate the unit. If within that year, another unit in the residential development is vacated, the owner may, at the owner’s option, allow the tenant to remain in the original unit and raise the tenant’s rent to market rate and designate the newly vacated unit for the original unit at the applicable affordable housing cost. The newly vacated unit must be comparable in size (i.e., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.) and location (i.e., same floor, same view, etc.) as the original unit.


17.32.100 Adjustments, Waivers

The requirements of this chapter may be adjusted or waived in extreme cases if the developer demonstrates to the Council by the presentation of substantial evidence that applying the requirements of this chapter would take property in violation of the United States or California constitutions.

A.    Timing. To receive an adjustment or waiver, the developer must make a showing when applying for a first approval for the residential development, and/or as part of any appeal that the City provides as part of the process for the first approval.

B.    Considerations. In making a determination on an application to adjust or waive the requirements of this chapter, the Council may assume each of the following when applicable:

1.    That the developer is subject to the inclusionary housing requirement or in-lieu fee;

2.    The extent to which the developer will benefit from inclusionary incentives;

3.    That the developer will be obligated to provide the most economical inclusionary units feasible in terms of construction, design, location and tenure; and

4.    That the developer is likely to obtain other housing subsidies where such funds are reasonably available.

C.    Decision and further appeal. The Council, upon legal advice provided by or at the behest of the City Attorney, will determine the application and issue a written decision.

D.    Modification of plan. If the Council, upon legal advice provided by or at the behest of the City Attorney, determines that the application of the provisions of this chapter lacks a reasonable relationship between the impact of a proposed residential project and the requirements of this chapter, or that applying the requirement of this chapter would take property in violation of the United States or California constitutions, the inclusionary housing plan shall be modified, adjusted or waived to reduce the obligations under this chapter to the extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result. If the Council determines no violation of the United States or California constitutions would occur through application of this chapter, the requirements of this chapter remain applicable.


17.32.110 Enforcement

A.    Penalty for violation. It shall be a misdemeanor to violate any provision of this chapter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall also be a misdemeanor for any person to sell or rent to another person an affordable unit under this chapter at a price or rent exceeding the maximum allowed under this chapter or to sell or rent an affordable unit to a household not qualified under this chapter. It shall further be a misdemeanor for any person to provide false or materially incomplete information to the City or to a seller or lessor of an inclusionary unit to obtain occupancy of housing for which he or she is not eligible.

B.    Legal action. The City may institute any appropriate legal actions or proceedings necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter, including:

1.    Actions to revoke, deny or suspend any permit, including a Building Permit, Certificate of Occupancy, or discretionary approval;

2.    Actions to recover from any violator of this chapter civil fines, restitution to prevent unjust enrichment from a violation of this chapter, and/or enforcement costs, including attorneys fees;

3.    Eviction or foreclosure; and

4.    Any other appropriate action for injunctive relief or damages. Failure of any official or agency to fulfill the requirements of this chapter shall not excuse any person, owner, household or other party from the requirements of this chapter.

c.    Eligibility for increased bonus. An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density bonus provided by this subsection if all of the following conditions are met:

(1)    The applicant donates and transfers the land no later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application.

(2)    The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low-income households in an amount not less than 10 percent of the number of residential units of the proposed development.

(3)    The transferred land is at least one acre, or of sufficient size to permit development of at least 40 units, has the appropriate General Plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development as affordable housing, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure. The land shall have appropriate zoning and development standards to make the development of the affordable units feasible.

(4)    No later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development, the transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than Building Permits, necessary for the development of the very low-income housing units on the transferred land, except that the City may subject the proposed development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized by Government Code Section 65583.2(I) if the design is not reviewed by the City before the time of transfer.

(5)    The transferred land and the affordable units shall be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with Section 17.33.070 (Continued Availability), which shall be recorded on the property at the time of dedication.

(6)    The land is transferred to the City or to a housing developer approved by the City. The City may require the applicant to identify and transfer the land to the approved housing developer.

C.    Density bonus calculations. The calculation of a density bonus in compliance with this section that results in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number, as required by state law. For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the residential units do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels.

D.    Requirements for amendments or discretionary approval. The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary approval.

E.    Location of bonus units. The developer may locate density bonus units in the housing project in other than the areas where the units for the lower-income households are located.


17.33.040 Allowed Incentives or Concessions

A.    Applicant request and City approval. An applicant for a density bonus in compliance with this chapter may submit to the City a proposal for the specific incentives or concessions listed in Subsection C of this section (Type of incentives), that the applicant requests in compliance with this section, and may request a meeting with the Director. The applicant may file their request either prior to an application for City approval of the proposed project, or concurrently with the application for project approval. The Council shall grant an incentive or concession request that complies with this section unless the Council makes either of the following findings in writing, based upon substantial evidence:

1.    The incentive or concession is not required to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Subsection 17.33.070.B (Unit cost requirements); or

2.    The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and safety or the physical environment, or on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.

The applicant shall show that a waiver or modification of development standards is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.

B.    Number of incentives. The applicant shall receive the following number of incentives or concessions:

1.    One incentive or concession. One incentive or concession for a project that includes at least 10 percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least five percent for very low-income households, or at least 10 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.

2.    Two incentives or concessions. Two incentives or concessions for a project that includes at least 20 percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least 10 percent for very low-income households, or at least 20 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.

3.    Three incentives or concessions. Three incentives or concessions for a project that includes at least 30 percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least 15 percent for very low-income households, or at least 30 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development.

C.    Type of incentives. For the purposes of this chapter, concession or incentive means any of the following:

1.    A reduction in the site development standards of this Zoning Ordinance (e.g., site coverage limitations, setbacks, reduced parcel sizes, and/or parking requirements (see also Section 17.33.050 (Parking Requirements in Density Bonus Projects)), or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission in compliance with Health and Safety Code Section 18901 et seq., that would otherwise be required, that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions;

2.    Approval of mixed-use zoning not otherwise allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in conjunction with the housing development, if nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development, and the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development in the area where the project will be located;

3.    Other regulatory incentives proposed by the applicant or the City that will result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions; and/or

4.    In its sole and absolute discretion, a direct financial contribution granted by the Council, including writing down land costs, subsidizing the cost of construction, or participating in the cost of infrastructure.

D.    Effect of incentive or concession. The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary approval.


17.33.050 Parking Requirements in Density Bonus Projects

A.    Applicability. This section applies to a development that meets the requirements of Section 17.33.020 (Eligibility for Bonus, Incentives, and Concessions), but only at the request of the applicant. An applicant may request additional parking incentives or concessions beyond those provided in this section in compliance with Section 17.33.040 (Allowed Incentives and Concessions).

B.    Number of parking spaces required.

1.    At the request of the applicant, the City shall require the following vehicular parking ratios for a project that complies with the requirements of Section 17.33.020 (Eligibility for Bonus, Incentives, and Concessions), inclusive of handicapped and guest parking:

17.33.060 Bonus and Incentives for Housing with Child Care Facilities

A housing development that complies with the resident and project size requirements of Subsections 17.33.020.A and B, and also includes as part of that development a child care facility other than a large or small family day care home, that will be located on the site of, as part of, or adjacent to the development, shall be subject to the following additional bonus, incentives, and requirements:

A.    Additional bonus and incentives. The City shall grant a housing development that includes a child care facility in compliance with this section either of the following:

1.    An additional density bonus that is an amount of floor area in square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the floor area of the child care facility; or

1.    The City shall require, as a condition of approving the housing development, that:

a.    The child care facility shall remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the density bonus units are required to remain affordable in compliance with Section 17.33.070 (Continued Availability); and

b.    Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low-income households, lower-income households, or families of moderate income shall equal a percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are required for very low-income households, lower-income households, or families of moderate income in compliance with Subsection 17.33.020.A (Resident requirements).

2.    The City shall not be required to provide a density bonus for a child care facility in compliance with this section if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities.


17.33.070 Continued Availability

The units that qualified the housing development for a density bonus and other incentives and concessions shall continue to be available as affordable units in compliance with the following requirements, as required by Government Code Section 65915(c). See also Section 17.33.110 (Control of Resale).

A.    Duration of affordability. The applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure the continued availability of the units that qualified the housing development for a density bonus and other incentives and concessions, as follows:

2.    Moderate-income units in common interest development. The continued availability of moderate-income units in a common interest development shall be maintained for a minimum of 10 years.

B.    Unit cost requirements. The rents and owner-occupied costs charged for the housing units in the development that qualify the project for a density bonus and other incentives and concessions shall not exceed the following amounts during the period of continued availability required by this section:

1.    Lower-income units. Rents for the lower-income density bonus units shall be set at an affordable rent as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50053; and

2.    Owner-occupied units. Owner-occupied units shall be available at an affordable housing cost as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5.

C.    Occupancy and resale of moderate income common interest development units. An applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure that the initial occupant of moderate income units that are directly related to the receipt of the density bonus in a common interest development as defined in Civil Code Section 1351, are persons and families of moderate income, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50093, and that the units are offered at an affordable housing cost, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5. The City shall enforce an equity sharing agreement unless it is in conflict with the requirements of another public funding source or law. The following requirements apply to the equity sharing agreement:

1.    Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation.

2.    The City shall recapture any additional subsidy and its proportionate share of appreciation, which shall then be used within three years for any of the purposes described in Health and Safety Code Section 33334.2(e) that promote home ownership. For the purposes of this section:

a.    The City’s initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale, minus the initial sale price to the moderate income household, plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value.

b.    The City’s proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale. (Ord. 1025 § 13, 2015)


17.33.080 Location and Type of Designated Units

A.    Location/dispersal of units.

17.33.090 Processing of Bonus Requests

A.    Permit requirement. A request for a density bonus and other incentives and concessions shall be evaluated and decided through Use Permit approval in compliance with Section 17.62.070 (Use Permit and Minor Use Permit); provided, the decision of the Commission on a Use Permit application shall be a recommendation to the Council, and the density bonus and other incentives and concessions shall be approved by the Council.

B.    Findings for approval. In addition to the findings required by Section 17.62.070 for the approval of a Use Permit, the approval of a density bonus and other incentives and concessions shall require that the review authority first make all of the following additional findings:

17.33.110 Control of Resale

In order to maintain the availability of for-sale affordable housing units constructed in compliance with this chapter, the following resale conditions shall apply:

A.    Limits on resale price. The price received by the seller of an affordable unit shall be limited to the purchase price plus an increase based on the Monterey metropolitan area consumer price index, an amount consistent with the increase in the median income since the date of purchase, or the fair market value, whichever is less. Before offering an affordable housing unit for sale, the seller shall provide written notice to the City of their intent to sell. The notice shall be provided by certified mail to the Director.

B.    Units to be offered to the City. Home ownership affordable units constructed, offered for sale, or sold under the requirements of this section shall be offered to the City or its assignee for a period of at least 90 days from the date the notice of intent to sell is delivered to the City by the first purchaser or subsequent purchasers. Home ownership affordable units shall be sold and resold from the date of the original sale only to households as determined to be eligible for affordable units by the City in compliance with this section. The seller shall not levy or charge any additional fees nor shall any “finders fee” or other monetary consideration be allowed other than customary real estate commissions and closing costs.

C.    Declaration of restrictions. The owners of any affordable unit shall attach and legally reference in the grant deed conveying title of the affordable ownership unit a declaration of restrictions provided by the City, stating the restrictions imposed in compliance with this section.

B.    Waiver of standards preventing the use of bonuses, incentives, or concessions.

1.    As required by Government Code Section 65915(e), the City will not apply a development standard that will have the effect of precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of Subsection 17.33.020.A (Resident requirements), at the densities or with the concessions or incentives allowed by this chapter.

2.    An applicant may submit to the City a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development and zoning standards that would otherwise inhibit the utilization of a density bonus on a specific site, including minimum parcel size, side setbacks, and placement of public works improvements.

3.    The applicant shall show that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.

C.    City exemption. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections A and B of this section, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the City to:

1.    Grant a density bonus, incentive, or concession, or waive or reduce development standards, if the bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or reduction, would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact; or

The requirements of this chapter are intended to ensure that suitable off-street parking and loading facilities are provided for all uses and developments, and that the facilities are properly designed, attractive, and located to be unobtrusive while meeting the needs of the specific use.


17.34.020 Applicability

A.    Off-street parking and loading required. Each land use and structure, including a change or expansion of a land use or structure, shall provide suitable off-street parking and loading facilities in compliance with this chapter.

B.    Timing of improvements. A land use shall not be commenced and a structure shall not be occupied until the parking and loading improvements required by this chapter are completed and approved in accordance with the applicable development permit.

C.    Common, shared, or municipal provided parking. Where common or shared parking has been duly authorized or where parking can be provided through a municipal parking lot, the parking requirements required by this chapter shall not apply.

D.    Parking district. Upon recommendation of the Commission, the parking requirements required by this chapter shall not apply in those areas where a parking district has been duly established.


17.34.030 General Parking Regulations

A.    Parking and loading spaces to be permanent. Each parking and loading space shall be permanently available, marked, and maintained for parking or loading purposes for the use it is intended to serve; provided, that the approval of a Limited Term Permit (Section 17.62.040) may allow the temporary use of a parking or loading space for other purposes.

1.    Subdivision of property. No subdivision shall be approved that has the effect of reducing existing on-site parking below the minimum number of spaces required by this chapter.

2.    Lot restriping. A parking lot shall not be restriped to reduce the number of parking spaces below the minimum required by this chapter.

B.    Parking and loading to be unrestricted. A lessee, owner, tenant, or other person having control of the operation of the premises for which parking or loading spaces are required by this chapter shall not prevent, prohibit, or restrict authorized persons from using the spaces without the prior approval of the Zoning Administrator.

C.    Vehicles for sale. A vehicle may be parked or placed on private property for the purpose of displaying the vehicle for hire, rental, or sale as follows:

1.    In residential zones (single-family and multi-family), up to two vehicles are permitted to be on the property provided the registered owner of the vehicle must occupy the dwelling unit as their principal residence; and

2.    In nonresidential zones, a vendor may display vehicles for hire, sale, or rental on private property when said property is zoned and developed for such use and the vendor is licensed to transact such use at that location.

D.    Cargo/shipping containers. No cargo/shipping container (e.g., metal “Seatrain” or other similar cargo container) shall be stored within a designated parking space, loading area or residential driveway. (Ord. 1051 § 10, 2018)


17.34.040 Number of Parking Spaces Required

Each land use shall be provided the number of off-street parking spaces required by this section. See Sections 17.34.050, 17.34.060, 17.34.070, and 17.34.090 for off-street parking requirements for accessible vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, and recreational vehicles, respectively.

A.    Parking requirements by land use.

1.    Each land use shall provide the number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 3-8, except where a greater number of spaces are authorized through Minor Use Permit or Use Permit approval in compliance with Section 17.62.070 (Use Permit and Minor Use Permit) or where exceptions apply for legal nonconforming parking, in compliance with Subsection 17.72.030.C (Nonconforming Parking). Approval of excess parking spaces shall comply with Subsection F of this section (Excessive Parking).

2.    A land use not specifically listed in Table 3-8 shall provide parking as required by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall use the requirements in Table 3-8 as a guide in determining the appropriate number of off-street parking spaces required for the use.

3.    In any case where Table 3-8 expresses a parking requirement based on floor area in square feet (for example: one space for each 1,000 sf), “sf” shall mean square feet of gross interior leasable floor area, unless stated otherwise (e.g., ground area).

4.    When calculating a parking requirement for a residential use under Table 3-8, the area within an enclosed garage shall not be included as interior floor area for the purpose of establishing the parking requirement.

5.    A single land use with accessory components or a site with multiple land uses shall provide parking for each component. For example, a hotel with a gift shop shall provide the parking spaces required by Table 3-8 for a hotel (e.g., the guest rooms) and for a gift shop.

B.    Expansion of structure, change in use. When a structure is enlarged, or when a change in its use requires more off-street parking than the previous use, additional parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with this chapter. See also Chapter 17.72 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels) for any exceptions or exemptions regarding parking requirements for expanded structures or changes in use.

C.    Multi-tenant sites.

1.    A site with multiple tenants (e.g., two or more) shall provide the aggregate number of parking spaces required for each separate use (e.g., sum of the separate requirements for each use).

2.    When a multi-tenant center includes one or more uses that will need more parking than retail uses (e.g., a health/fitness facility, restaurant, or theater), additional parking shall be required for the non-retail use unless a parking reduction is approved in compliance with Section 17.34.100 (Reduction of Parking Requirements). 

D.    Alternate use of parking areas prohibited. Off-street parking areas shall not be used for the repair, servicing, or storage of vehicles or materials, the sale of any goods or services, or any other work area that is not specifically associated with an approved development permit on the site and/or retail center.

E.    No reduction of parking facility allowed. 

1.    Nonresidential use. No nonresidential off-street parking facility (covered or uncovered) shall be reduced in capacity or in area without sufficient additional capacity or additional area being provided in order to comply with the parking regulations of this chapter. See also Section 17.34.100 (Reduction of Parking Requirements) for reduced parking allowances.

2.    Residential use. No residential off-street parking facility, garage, carport, or uncovered parking space shall be reduced in capacity or in area, converted to habitable space, or modified to restrict or limit vehicle access unless additional parking of the same capacity is provided to replace the reduced area, converted garage, carport, or uncovered parking space in compliance with this Zoning Code.

F.    Excessive parking.

1.    The City discourages a land use being provided more off-street parking spaces than required by this chapter in order to avoid the inefficient use of land, unnecessary pavement, and excessive stormwater runoff from paved surfaces.

2.    The provision of off-street parking spaces in excess of 10 percent over the requirements in Table 3-8 is allowed only with Minor Use Permit approval in compliance with Section 17.62.070 (Use Permit and Minor Use Permit), and only when additional landscaping, pedestrian amenities, and necessary storm drain improvements are provided to the satisfaction of the review authority.

G.    Rounding of calculations. If a fractional number of required parking spaces is obtained in calculations performed in compliance with this chapter, one additional parking space shall be required for a fractional unit of 0.5 or above; no additional space shall be required for a fractional unit of less than 0.5.

H.    Bench or bleacher seating. Where fixed seating is provided as benches, bleachers, pews, or similar seating, a seat shall be defined as 24 inches of bench space for the purpose of calculating the number of parking spaces required by Table 3-8.

I.    Parking based on employees. Whenever parking requirements are based on the number of employees, calculations shall be based on the largest number of employees on duty at any one time.

J.    Use of on-street parking. Available on-street parking spaces cannot be used to meet the parking requirements identified in this chapter.

1.    An exception to this provision may be granted for a nonresidential use, licensed day care facility or a preschool, subject to Minor Use Permit approval, in compliance with Section 17.62.070.

2.    The Minor Use Permit for an exception may only be issued if it meets all of the following criteria, in addition to the findings identified in Section 17.62.070:

a.    The exception shall be granted only for uses in an existing structure. It shall not be granted for any expansion of gross interior floor area to a structure or for new construction.

b.    The maximum amount of parking which is feasible shall be provided on site.

c.    The exception shall only be granted in situations where the City Engineer has determined that the exception will not result in potentially unsafe conditions for vehicles or pedestrians.

3.    Each Minor Use Permit that grants an exception to off-street parking requirements shall be reviewed on an annual basis and, if it is found that the use of on-street parking spaces by the facility is creating a nuisance, the City may initiate proceedings to revoke the Minor Use Permit in compliance with Section 17.80.060 (Permit Revocation).

K.    Nonconforming parking. See Chapter 17.72 (Nonconforming Use, Structure, and Parcels) for nonconforming parking allowances.

b.    All grading plans relating to the loading facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer before any work can commence.


17.34.140 Parking In-Lieu Fees

A.    Monetary payment to the City. Where it is neither feasible nor desirable to provide some or all of the off-street parking spaces required by Section 17.34.030 (General Parking Regulations), an owner of commercial land shall be allowed, subject to the approval of the Commission, to make a monetary in-lieu payment to the City in an amount which is equal to the value of the required off-street parking on a per-parking-space basis. Projects within adopted specific plan areas or parking districts and previously approved redevelopment projects are exempt from Commission approval, when parking in-lieu fees are approved in conjunction with such projects.

B.    Criteria for determining amount of payment. In addition to the costs associated with land acquisition, the projected costs of providing all of the following services and improvements, based upon 350 square feet of site area for each parking space, shall be used in determining the amount of the required in-lieu payment:

1.    Asphalt surfacing;

2.    Drainage;

3.    Engineering, inspection, and contingencies;

4.    Grading;

5.    Landscaping/screening;

6.    Sand and grease traps;

7.    Striping and wheel stops; and

8.    The cost of maintaining the space for 10 years.

C.    Council establishment of value of off-street parking facilities. At least once every two years, the Council shall establish, by resolution, the value of off-street parking facilities in the City on a per-parking-space basis. Initially, the in-lieu fee shall be $3,000 for each parking space. Funds collected by the City from the payments shall be deposited into a special fund and shall be used by the City only for the purpose of acquiring and/or developing future off-street parking facilities.

D.    Municipal parking lot plan. A parking in-lieu fee may be accepted by the City only after it has been determined that payment of a fee will lead to the provision of conveniently located off-street parking facilities which are consistent with a currently adopted municipal parking lot plan. The plan shall determine, at a minimum, areas of need, potential parking lot locations, and proposed parking capacities.

E.    Parking facilities which are provided by the City.

17.40.060 General Requirements for All Signs

The following rules shall govern the computation of sign area:

A.    Sign area measurement. Sign area measurement to determine compliance with the sign area limitations of this chapter shall occur as follows:

1.    Surface area. The surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of all emblem, framing, logo, representation, writing, or other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles with no more than eight perimeter lines (see Figure 3-15).

2.    Sign structure. Supporting bracing or framework that is determined by the Zoning Administrator to be clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be included in the calculation of total sign area.

3.    Multi-faced signs. The area of a double-faced sign shall be calculated for one face only, unless the two faces are not back-to-back, parallel, and/or are separated by more than 12 inches.

4.    Three-dimensional objects. The area of a sign consisting of one or more three-dimensional objects (e.g., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statue-like trademarks), shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane (see Figure 3-17).

B.    Sign height measurement. The height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the lowest point of the base of the sign at normal grade, to the top of the highest attached component of the sign (see Figure 3-17). Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of either the:

1.    Existing grade before construction; or

2.    Newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any berming, filling, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.

Figure 3-17 – Sign Measurement

C.    Sign height limitations.

1.    Maximum height for freestanding signs. A freestanding sign shall not exceed a height of six feet above normal grade in residential zones. Freestanding signs shall be limited to 14 feet above normal grade in all other zones except as allowed under a Master Sign Program or specific plan.

2.    Maximum height for signs on structures. The top of a sign mounted on a structure shall not extend higher than the lesser of:

a.    The window sills of the second floor, except for hotel/motels;

b.    The top of the wall to which the sign is attached, in the case of a one-story structure; or

c.    Twenty feet above normal grade; or

d.    As approved in accordance with Master Sign Program.

D.    Sign location requirements. Each sign shall be located in compliance with the following requirements and all other applicable provisions of this chapter:

1.    Each sign shall be located on the same site as the subject of the sign, except as otherwise allowed by this chapter.

2.    No sign shall project over public property, or the public right-of-way, except where the City has granted an Encroachment Permit in addition to a Sign Permit.

3.    No sign shall be placed so as to interfere with the operation of a door, fire escape, or window.

4.    Signs shall not be located within traffic safety visibility areas (see Subsection 17.30.030.E), unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Department. Exception: Pole signs with a grade to bottom of sign cabinet clearance of at least six feet may be located within traffic safety visibility areas.

E.    Signs placed within the public right-of-way.

1.    No sign shall be allowed within the public right-of-way except for the following:

a.    Public signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental agency to convey public information, identify public property, post legal notices, or direct or regulate pedestrian or vehicular traffic;

b.    Bus stop signs installed by a public transit company;

c.    Informational signs of a public utility regarding its lines, pipes, poles, or other facilities; or

d.    Emergency warning signs erected by a governmental agency, a public utility company, or a contractor doing authorized work within the public right-of-way.

e.    Awnings, canopies, projecting signs, and marquees which are entirely supported on private property may extend up to four feet into the public right-of-way or no closer than three feet from the portion of the public right-of-way used for vehicular traffic (measured from the face of the curb). Portions of the awnings, canopies, projecting signs, and marquees extending into the public right-of-way or over a public sidewalk shall have a minimum vertical clearance of eight feet between the bottom of the structure and the surface of the ground, sidewalk, or paving.

2.    Any sign installed or placed within the public right-of-way other than in compliance with this section shall be forfeited to the public and be subject to confiscation.

3.    In addition to other remedies identified in Chapter 17.80 (Enforcement and Penalties), the City shall have the right to recover from the owner, or person placing the sign, the full costs for sign removal and disposal.

4.    A sign permit shall not be required for City, state, or federal signs placed within the public right-of-way.

F.    Design criteria for signs. The following design criteria shall be used in reviewing the design of individual signs. Substantial conformance with each of the following design criteria shall be required before a Sign Permit or Building Permit can be approved:

1.    Color. Colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious with one another and relate to the dominant colors of the other structures on the site. Contrasting colors may be utilized if the overall effect of the sign is still compatible with the structure colors and prevailing colors in the surrounding neighborhood (where a theme can be identified).

2.    Design and construction. The intent of this subsection is to ensure public safety, to achieve signs of careful construction, neat and readable copy, and durability, to reduce maintenance costs, and to prevent dilapidation.

a.    Each sign should be designed by a professional (e.g., architect, building designer, landscape architect, interior designer, or another whose principal business is the design, manufacture, or sale of signs) or others who are capable of producing professional results.

b.    Each permanent sign should be constructed by persons whose principal business is building construction or a related trade including sign manufacturing and installation businesses, or others capable of producing professional results.

c.    Raceways and other electrical or mechanical sign components not directly incorporated into the sign design shall be concealed within the sign structure or building facade.

3.    Materials and structure.

a.    Sign materials (including framing and supports) shall be representative of the type and scale of materials used on the primary on-site structure and on other on-site signs.

b.    Materials for permanent signs shall be high quality, durable, and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance. Signs shall not be constructed of exposed plywood or other composite wood material; all wood materials shall contain a vinyl- or paint-coated face or be treated with a sealant to withstand the outside elements. If a marine density overlay (MDO) board is used, edges shall be sealed with weatherproofed trim and flashing.

c.    The size of the structural members (e.g., braces, columns, and crossbeams) shall be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting. In general, fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports.

d.    The use of individual letters incorporated into the structure’s design is encouraged, rather than signs with background and framing other than the structure’s wall(s).

4.    Street address. The review authority may require that a sign include the site street address, where it determines that public safety and emergency vehicle response would be more effectively served than if the street address were displayed solely on one or more structures on the site.

G.    Copy design guidelines. The City does not regulate the message content (copy) of signs; however, the following are principles of copy design and layout that can enhance the readability and attractiveness of signs. Copy design and layout consistent with these principles is encouraged, but not required.

1.    Sign copy should relate only to the name and/or nature of the business or commercial center.

2.    Permanent signs that advertise continuous sales, special prices, or include phone numbers, etc., should be avoided.

3.    Information should be conveyed briefly or by logo, symbol, or other graphic manner. The intent should be to increase the readability of the sign and thereby enhance the identity of the business.

4.    The area of letters or symbols should not exceed 40 percent of the background area in commercial and industrial zones or 60 percent in residential zones.

5.    Freestanding signs should contain the street address of the parcel or the range of addresses for a multi-tenant center.

H.    Sign lighting. Sign lighting shall be designed to minimize light and glare on surrounding rights-of-way and properties in compliance with Section 17.30.070 (Outdoor Lighting) and the following:

1.    External light sources shall be directed and shielded so they do not produce glare on any object other than the sign.

2.    The light illuminating a sign shall not be of a brightness or intensity that will interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of residential properties.

3.    Sign illumination shall not blink, flash, flutter, or change light brightness, color, or intensity, except for electronic message display signs per Section 17.40.080.I, Electronic Message Display Signs.

4.    Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as to be confused or construed as traffic control devices.

5.    Neither the direct nor reflected light from primary light sources shall create hazards for pedestrians or operators of motor vehicles.

6.    Reflective-type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed 15 watts shall not be used so as to expose the face of the bulb or lamp to a public right-of-way or adjacent property.

7.    Light sources shall utilize hard-wired fluorescent or compact fluorescent lamps, or other lighting technology that is of equal or greater energy efficiency.

8.    Permanently installed illuminated panels, visible tubing, and strings of lights outlining all or a portion of a structure, other than lighting that is primarily for indirectly illuminating architectural features, signs, or landscaping, shall be deemed “signs” subject to this chapter and shall be counted as part of the allowed sign area. Each line of tubing or lights shall be deemed to have a minimum width of at least six inches for the purpose of calculating area.

I.    Maintenance of signs.

1.    Each sign and supporting hardware, including temporary signs, shall be maintained in good repair and functioning properly at all times.

2.    Any repair to a sign shall be of equal or better in quality of materials and design as the original sign.

3.    A sign that is not properly maintained and is dilapidated shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated in compliance with the Municipal Code and Chapter 17.36 (Property Maintenance).

4.    When an existing sign is removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and other supports that are no longer required shall be removed.

5.    Unpainted areas shall be painted to match the adjacent portion of the structure or the sign support structure.

6.    All electronic message display signs shall contain a default mechanism that will cause the sign to revert immediately to a black screen if the sign malfunctions. (Ord. 1045 §§ 3(2, 3), 2017)

Such intensity restriction may vary by time of day and ambient light conditions. Illuminated signs located adjacent to any residential area shall be shielded to direct light downward and away from adjacent properties such that there is no spillover light and shall be controlled by a rheostat or functional equivalent to avoid excessive glare to residential properties.

8.    Light detector. No permit for such sign shall be issued unless the sign is installed with an automatic or a scheduled dimming time by which the sign’s light intensity will reduce when ambient light conditions darken. Such dimming feature shall reduce the light intensity from the sign from dusk to dawn to a level that does not impair the visibility on any adjacent roadway, or be directed onto a residential property.

17.50.040    Compliance with Municipal Code Required


17.50.010 Intent and Purpose

A.    Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to provide special design guidelines, standards, and development regulations to regulate the time, place, and manner of the operation of adult-oriented businesses in order to minimize the negative secondary effects associated with these businesses including, but not limited to, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult-oriented businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses, including religious facilities, parks, playgrounds, schools, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult-oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere.

B.    Purpose. It is, therefore, the purpose of this chapter to:

1.    Establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while allowing the location of adult-oriented businesses in certain areas; and

2.    Regulate adult-oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City.

C.    Restriction on content and access not intended. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.


17.50.020 Definitions

Definitions of the technical terms and phrases used in this chapter are in Municipal Code Chapter 5.08 (Adult Businesses).


17.50.030 Prohibited Areas and Minimum Proximity Requirements

1.    Within a 300-foot radius from any existing residential zoning district or use. The distance between a proposed adult-oriented business use and a residential zoning district or use shall be measured from the nearest exterior walls of the facilities housing the adult-oriented business use or proposed adult-oriented business use to the nearest property line included within a residential zoning district or property in current residential use, along a straight line extended between the two points.

2.    Within 500 feet of any other adult-oriented business as defined in this chapter which is located either inside or outside the jurisdiction of the City of Seaside. The distance between the two adult-oriented business uses shall be measured between the nearest exterior walls of the facilities housing the adult-oriented business use and proposed adult-oriented business use along a straight line extended between the two uses.

3.    Within 500 feet from any existing park, playground, religious facility, or school use or property zoned Open Space (OSR or OSC) or Public/Institutional (PI). The distance between a proposed adult-oriented business use and park, playground, religious facility, or school use or property zoned Open Space (OSR or OSC) or Public/Institutional (PI), shall be measured from the nearest exterior wall of the facility housing the adult-oriented business use or proposed adult-oriented business use to the nearest property line where the park, playground, religious facility, or school use is located, or property zoned Open Space (OSR or OSC) or Public/Institutional (PI) along a straight line extended between the two points.

C.    Separation requirements also apply to specified uses or districts outside of the City. The above distance limitations shall also apply to residential districts or uses and parks, playgrounds, schools, and religious facility uses or property so designated in the General Plan Land Use Element of an adjacent jurisdiction.

17.52.252 Short-Term Rental License

A.    Statement of purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a licensing process, together with appropriate standards that regulate short-term rental of single-family and multi-family dwellings in residential districts, to minimize negative secondary effects of short-term rental use on surrounding neighborhoods, and to preserve the character of neighborhoods in which any such use occurs. This chapter addresses traffic, noise and density; ensures health, safety and welfare of neighborhoods as well as of renters and guests patronizing short-term rentals; and imposes limits on the number of licenses issued to ensure long-term availability of the affordable housing stock. This chapter also sets regulations to ensure enforcement of these standards, and collection and payment of fees and transient occupancy taxes.

This chapter shall not provide any property owner with the right or privilege to violate any private conditions, covenants or restrictions applicable to the owner’s property that may prohibit the use of such owner’s residential property for short-term rental purposes as defined in this chapter.

The City Council finds adoption of a comprehensive code to regulate issuance of, and conditions attached to, short-term rental licenses is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The purposes of this chapter are to provide a licensing system and to impose operational requirements in order to minimize the potential adverse impacts of transient uses on residential neighborhoods.

The City Council finds the regulation of short-term rental uses, including its nontransferability provisions, to be a valid exercise of the City’s police power in furtherance of the legitimate governmental interests documented in this chapter.

A.    Facility placement.

1.    Standards for all facilities.

a.    A roof-mounted antenna on a structure that complies with applicable height limits shall be set back from the nearest roof edge the equivalent of the height of the tower or a minimum of 10 feet, whichever is greater.

b.    A ground-mounted communication facility (including towers and antennas) shall be located as far as possible from all property boundaries, and set back from the property line at a ratio of one and one-half horizontal feet for every one foot of height, where feasible.

c.    A tower or antenna shall be set back from any site boundary or public right-of-way by a minimum of 25 feet. No part of any tower shall extend into a required front setback or beyond a property line of the site.

d.    Communication facilities other than towers and antennas shall be located either within a structure, underground, in a rear yard (not visible from a public right-of-way) or on a screened roof top area. A ground-mounted facility that is located within a front or side setback or within a public right-of-way shall be underground so that the facility will not detract from the image or appearance of the City.

2.    Facilities within commercial zones. A tower within a commercial zone shall be separated by a minimum distance of 500 feet from any other tower, and there shall be no more than two towers on a single assessor’s parcel or developed site, unless the towers are located on a public facility as described in Subsection A.1 of this section. 

B.    Height limitations.

1.    All ground-mounted communications equipment, antennas, poles, or towers shall be of a minimum functional height.

2.    The height of a tower located on the ground shall not exceed 60 feet in the PI zone and 40 feet in a commercial zone. The review authority may grant an exception to allow towers of up to 80 feet where the review authority determines that the increased height is necessary for adequate coverage, and the tower will colocate service providers.

3.    The height of a communications facility located on a structure other than a dedicated support tower shall not exceed 20 feet above the highest point of the structure and shall at no time exceed the height allowed by the subject zoning district.

4.    An antenna mounted on the side of a structure shall not extend above the structure’s parapet so that it is visible from below against the sky.

Figure 4-1 – Telecommunication Tower Height Limits

C.    Colors and materials. All antennas, poles, towers, or equipment, including ancillary support equipment, shall have a nonreflective finish and shall be painted or otherwise treated to match or blend with the primary background and minimize visual impacts. Antennas attached to a structure shall be painted or otherwise treated to match the exterior of the structure or the antenna’s background color. All ground-mounted equipment shall be covered with a clear anti-graffiti type material of a type approved by the Director or shall be adequately secured to prevent graffiti.

D.    Screening, landscaping. All ground-mounted equipment, antennas, poles, or towers shall be sited to be screened by existing development, topography, or vegetation. Ground-mounted facilities shall be located within structures, underground, or in areas where substantial screening by existing structures or vegetation can be achieved. Additional new vegetation or other screening may be required by the Director or by the Commission. The applicant shall use the smallest and least visible antennas possible to accomplish the owner/operator’s coverage objectives.

E.    Additional screening and landscaping. As part of project review, the Director, the Commission, or the Council (on appeal) may require additional screening and/or landscaping, undergrounding, an alternative color scheme, or relocation of a tower or ancillary equipment to a less obtrusive area of the site where it would have a less prominent visual presence due to slope, topography, size, or relationship to public rights-of-way.

F.    Power lines. All power lines to and within a communication facility site shall be underground.

G.    Backup power supplies. A backup power supply (i.e., generator) shall be enclosed within a structure and screened as required by review authority. Ancillary power supplies and fuel storage tanks to support backup power supplies shall require Use Permit approval.


17.54.070 Operation and Maintenance Standards

A.    Contact and site information. The owner or operator of any facility shall submit and maintain current at all times basic contact and site information. The applicant shall notify the City of any changes to the information submitted within 30 days of any change, including change of the name or legal status of the owner or operator. This information shall include the following:

1.    Identity, including name, address, and telephone number, and legal status of the owner of the facility including official identification numbers and FCC certification, and if different from the owner, the identity and legal status of the person or entity responsible for operating the facility;

2.    Name, address, and telephone number of a local contact person for emergencies;

3.    Type of service provided; and

4.    Identification signs, including emergency phone numbers of the utility provider, shall be posted at all communication facility sites.

B.    Facility maintenance. All communication facilities and related equipment, including lighting, fences, shields, cabinets, and poles shall be maintained in good repair, free from trash, debris, litter, graffiti, and other forms of vandalism, and any damage from any cause shall be repaired as soon as reasonably possible so as to minimize occurrences of dangerous conditions or visual blight. Graffiti shall be removed by the service provider from any facility or equipment as soon as practicable, and in no instances more than 48 hours from the time of notification by the City.

C.    Landscaping maintenance. All trees, foliage, and other landscaping elements on a communication facility site, whether or not used as screening, shall be maintained in good condition at all times in compliance with the approved landscape plan. The facility owner or operator shall be responsible for replacing any damaged, dead, or decayed landscaping as promptly as reasonably possible. Amendments or modifications to the landscape plan shall require approval by the Director. The Commission may also require a landscape maintenance agreement.

D.    Noise. Each communication facility shall be operated so as to minimize the generation of noise that is audible from off the site. Backup generators shall only be operated during periods of power outages, and shall not be tested on weekends or holidays, or between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. At no time shall equipment noise from any source exceed an exterior noise level of 60 dB at the property line.

E.    Site inspection required. Each owner or operator of a facility shall routinely and regularly inspect each site to ensure compliance with the standards identified in this chapter.

F.    Exterior lighting. Any exterior lighting shall be manually operated and used only during night maintenance or emergencies, unless otherwise required by applicable federal law or FCC rules. The lighting shall be constructed or located so that only the intended area is illuminated and off site glare is fully controlled. Light fixtures shall be low wattage, hooded, and downward directed.


17.54.080 Discontinuance and Site Restoration

All equipment associated with a communication facility shall be removed within 30 days of the discontinuance of the use and the site shall be restored to its original pre-construction condition, subject to the approval of the Director. The service provider shall provide the City with a notice of intent to vacate a site a minimum of 30 days before site vacation. This removal requirement, and appropriate bonding requirements, shall be included in the terms of a lease for a facility on public property. A private lease for a facility located on private property is encouraged to include terms for equipment removal, since the property owner shall be ultimately responsible for removal of the equipment.

17.60.010 Purpose

This chapter provides procedures and requirements for the preparation, filing, and initial processing of the planning permit applications required by this Zoning Ordinance.


17.60.020 Authority for Land Use and Zoning Decisions

Table 5-1 (Review Authority) identifies the review authority responsible for reviewing and making decisions on each type of application required by this Zoning Ordinance.


17.60.030 Multiple Permit Applications

A.    Concurrent filing. An applicant for a development project that requires the filing of more than one application shall file all related applications concurrently, unless waived by the Director, and submit appropriate processing deposits/fees in compliance with Section 17.60.050 (Application Fees). 

B.    Concurrent processing. Permit processing and environmental review shall be concurrent and the final decision on the project shall be by the review authority designated by Table 5-1 (Review Authority), except that:

1.    A multiple-application project with one or more applications requiring Council approval (for example, a rezoning of property or a Tentative Map), shall require concurrent Council approval of all applications.

2.    A Commission denial of a multiple-application project with one or more applications requiring Council approval shall be final unless appealed to the Council.


17.60.040 Application Preparation and Filing

A.    Pre-application conference. An applicant is encouraged to request a pre-application conference with the Director before completing and filing a planning permit application. The Director may invite representatives from other City departments to participate in the conference as the Director determines to be appropriate. The purpose of the conference is to generally:

1.    Review the proposal with the applicant and tentatively identify for the applicant City requirements that may apply to the project and tentatively identify potential issues and concerns that the project may raise for the City;

2.    Review the City’s procedures for project review and decision making; and

3.    Identify information and materials the City will require with the application, and any necessary technical studies and information relating to the environmental review of the project.

Neither the pre-application conference nor the City’s providing information and/or pertinent policies shall be construed as a staff recommendation for the approval or disapproval of the application or project. Any failure by City staff to identify all required studies or all applicable requirements shall not constitute a waiver of those requirements.

B.    Application contents. Each application for a permit, amendment, or other matter pertaining to this Zoning Ordinance shall be filed with the Department on a City application form, together with required fees and/or deposits, and all other information and materials required by the City as identified in the Department handout for the specific type of application. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Director before submitting an application to verify the materials that are necessary for application filing.

C.    Eligibility for filing. An application may only be filed by the owner of the proposed site, or other person with the written consent of the property owner.


17.60.050 Application Fees

A.    Fee schedule. The Council shall establish a schedule of fees for the processing of the applications required by this Zoning Ordinance, hereafter referred to as the City’s Fee Schedule.

B.    Multiple applications. The City’s processing fees are cumulative. For example, if a proposed project requires both a Use Permit and a Variance, both fees will be charged. Unusually large or complex projects may be subject to an hourly rate in addition to the basic application fees, at the discretion of the Director.

C.    Timing of payment. No application shall be deemed complete, and application processing shall not commence, until all required fees and/or deposits have been paid.

D.    Refunds and withdrawals. Required application fees cover City costs for public hearings, mailings, staff time, and the other activities involved in application processing. Therefore, no refund due to a disapproval shall be allowed. In the case of a withdrawal, the Director shall have the discretion to authorize a partial refund based upon the prorated costs to date and the status of the application at the time of withdrawal.

4.    Expiration of application. If an applicant fails to provide the information specified in the Director’s letter within 180 days following the date of the letter, the application shall expire and be deemed withdrawn, without any further action by the City. After the expiration of an application, future City consideration of the project shall require the submittal of a new, complete application and required fees.

5.    Environmental information. After an application has been accepted as complete, the Director may require the applicant to submit additional information needed for the environmental review of the project in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines.

B.    Referral of application. At the discretion of the Director, or where otherwise required by this Zoning Ordinance or state or federal law, an application may be referred to any public agency that may be affected by, or have an interest in the proposed project.


17.60.070 Project Evaluation and Staff Report

A.    Staff evaluation. The Director shall review each permit application filed in compliance with this Zoning Ordinance to determine whether the proposed project complies and is consistent with the applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, any applicable Design Guidelines, other applicable provisions of the Municipal Code, the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan.

B.    Staff report. If this Zoning Ordinance requires that a permit application be approved or disapproved by the Commission and/or Council, the Director shall provide a written recommendation to the review authority as to whether the application should be approved, approved subject to conditions, or disapproved. The staff report shall be provided to the applicant at the same time as it is provided to the review authority before a hearing on the application.

(1)    The trailer or mobile home will be in place during construction or remodeling of a permanent commercial, industrial, or classroom structure for a maximum of 12 months, or upon expiration of the Building Permit for the permanent structure, whichever first occurs; or

(2)    The applicant has demonstrated that the temporary work site is a short-term necessity for a maximum of 12 months, while a permanent work site is being obtained; and

c.    The trailer or mobile home is removed before final building inspection or the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the permanent structure.

(1)    A temporary business office or school classroom may be allowed for up to 24 months, and the Commission may grant one extension of up to 12 months.

11.    Similar temporary activities. A temporary activity that the Zoning Administrator determines is similar to the other activities listed in this subsection, and compatible with the applicable zoning and surrounding land uses.

F.    Longer-term limited activities subject to a Use Permit. The Commission may authorize a temporary land use that would occur for a longer period than allowed short-term land uses listed under this section by Use Permit approval, in compliance with Section 17.62.070 (Use Permit and Minor Use Permit). The Commission may determine that a proposed temporary land use is similar to and compatible with a listed use and may be allowed, only after first making all of the following findings with the determination:

1.    The characteristics of, and activities associated with, the use are similar to one or more of the listed allowed short-term uses under Subsection E of this section and will not involve a greater intensity than the uses listed in the zone;

2.    The use will be consistent with the intents and purposes of the applicable zone;

3.    The use is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plans;

4.    The use is compatible with the other uses allowed in the zone; and

5.    The use is not listed as allowable in any other zone.

A determination that a use qualifies as a similar and compatible use, with the findings supporting the determination, shall be made in writing upon Use Permit approval.

G.    Development standards. The Zoning Administrator shall establish the following standards based on the type of short-term activity, using the requirements of the applicable zone, and Articles 3 (Site Planning, Design, and Operational Standards) and 4 (Standards for Specific Land Uses) for guidance:

1.    Access, floor areas, heights, landscaping, off-street parking, setbacks, signs, utilities, and other structure and property development improvements and features;

2.    Measures for removal of the activity and site restoration, to ensure that no changes to the site would limit the range of possible future land uses otherwise allowed by this Zoning Ordinance; and

3.    Limitation on the duration of any approved “temporary structure,” to a maximum of 12 months, so that it shall not become a permanent or long-term structure.

H.    Application filing and processing. An application for a Limited Term Permit shall be filed and processed in compliance with Chapter 17.60 (Permit Application Filing and Processing).

Each site occupied by a short-term activity shall be cleaned of debris, litter, or other evidence of the temporary activity on completion or removal of the activity, and shall thereafter be used in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Performance security may be required before initiation of the activity to ensure cleanup after the activity is finished in compliance with Section 17.64.070 (Performance Guarantees).

2.    Performance security for temporary structures. Before issuance of a Limited Term Permit, the applicant shall provide performance security in a form and amount acceptable to the Zoning Administrator to guarantee removal of all temporary structures within 30 days following the expiration of the Limited Term Permit in compliance with Section 17.64.070 (Performance Guarantees).


17.62.050 Planned Development Permit

A.    Purpose. The Planned Development Permit is intended to provide for flexibility in the application of Zoning Ordinance standards to proposed development under limited and unique circumstances. The purpose is to allow consideration of innovation in site planning and other aspects of project design, and more effective design responses to site features, uses on adjoining properties, and environmental impacts than the Zoning Ordinance standards would produce without adjustment. The City expects each Planned Development project to be of obvious, significantly higher quality than would be achieved through conventional design practices and standards. Economic gain or the loss of prospective profits shall not be a basis for consideration of a Planned Development Permit.

B.    Applicability. A Planned Development Permit application may be filed and processed only under the following circumstances:

1.    Minimum site area. A Planned Development Permit may be requested only for a residential, commercial, industrial, or mixed-use development on a site of one acre or larger.

2.    Timing of permit. No Building or Grading Permit shall be issued on a site for which a Planned Development Permit is proposed until the Planned Development Permit has been approved in compliance with this section.

3.    Scope of approval.

a.    Planned Development Permit approval may adjust or modify, where determined by the review authority to be necessary and justifiable, any applicable development standard of this Zoning Ordinance (e.g., building height, setbacks, parking, street layout); provided, that the approval shall not authorize a land use that is not allowed in the applicable zone by Article 2.

b.    A project proposing increased residential density may only be approved by the Council in compliance with Chapter 17.33 (Affordable Housing Incentives).

C.    Project design and development standards. A planned development project shall be designed and constructed in compliance with the following requirements, in addition to all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Code:

1.    Infrastructure requirements. A planned development proposal shall not be approved unless adequate sewer and water lines and streets already service the site, or the developer proposes to install the facilities at the developer’s expense.

2.    Street design. The street system in a planned development shall conform to the existing topography rather than cut through it, to minimize cut-and-fill grading activities. A planned development of five or more acres shall be designed and constructed with direct access to at least one major thoroughfare.

3.    Preservation of community assets and landmarks. Historic places, groves, scenic points, trees, waterways, and other community assets and landmarks within the project site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.

4.    Open space. A residential planned development project of three acres or more shall be designed to either provide a minimum of 10 percent of the total area in one centrally located usable open space area, or dedicate 10 percent of the total area of the site to the City. If the latter alternative is proposed, the City shall reserve the right to accept or reject a dedication. In either instance, at least one-half of the total open space area shall be directly accessible to the public, and open to use year-round.

5.    Screening buffer. A planned unit development project proposed to be of higher density or different character than an existing abutting single-family residential neighborhood shall be designed and constructed to provide an appropriate screening buffer between the proposed development and the abutting residential neighborhood.

D.    Application filing and processing.

1.    Pre-application conference. An applicant who intends to file an application for Planned Development Permit approval shall first participate in a pre-application conference in compliance with Subsection 17.60.040.A (Application Preparation and Filing – Pre-application conference).

2.    Application content. An application shall be prepared and filed in compliance with Chapter 17.60 (Permit Application Filing and Processing). It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence in support of the findings, as required by Subsection G.1 of this section.

E.    Review authority. A Planned Development Permit may be granted by the Commission.

F.    Project review, notice, and hearing.

1.    Application review. Each Planned Development Permit application shall be analyzed by the Director to ensure that the application is consistent with the purpose and intent of this section. The Director shall submit a staff report and recommendation to the Commission for their consideration.

2.    Public hearing. The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on an application for a Planned Development Permit before the approval or disapproval of the permit. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided, and the hearing shall be conducted in compliance with Chapter 17.78 (Public Hearings).

G.    Commission action. Following a public hearing, the Commission may approve or disapprove a Planned Development Permit, and shall record the decision and the findings upon which the decision is based.

1.    Required findings. The Commission may approve a Planned Development Permit only after first finding that:

a.    The project is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan, any applicable density bonus requirements (see Chapter 17.33 – Affordable Housing Incentives), and allowed within the applicable zone;

b.    The project complies with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance other than those modified by the Planned Development Permit;

c.    The location, size, planning concepts, design features, and operating characteristics of the project are and will be compatible with the character of the site, and the land uses and development intended for the surrounding neighborhood by the General Plan;

d.    The approved modifications to the development standards of this Zoning Ordinance are necessary and appropriate to accommodate the superior design of the proposed project, its compatibility with adjacent land uses, and its successful mitigation of any identified environmental impacts;

e.    The development authorized by the Planned Development Permit approval will be of significantly higher quality, more energy efficient, more conserving of resources, and will produce fewer and less serious environmental impacts than development that could otherwise occur in compliance with the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance without adjustment;

f.    The project can be adequately, conveniently, and reasonably served by public facilities, services, and utilities;

g.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use would not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use, or detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City.

2.    Conditions of approval. In approving a Planned Development Permit, the Commission may impose any conditions deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the project will comply with the findings required by Subsection G.1 of this section.

H.    Time limit and expiration. A Planned Development Permit shall expire and become void 12 months from the date of approval, or upon the expiration of another time limit established by the review authority, unless project construction has commenced within the required time limit, and construction continues thereafter under valid Building Permits, or an extension of time has been granted by the Zoning Administrator. A Planned Development Permit may be extended once, for a maximum of 12 months.

I.    Post approval procedures. The procedures and requirements in Chapter 17.64 (Permit Implementation, Time Limits, and Extensions), and those related to appeals and revocation in Article 6 (Zoning Ordinance Administration), shall apply following a decision on an application for Planned Development Permit approval.

G.    Findings and decision for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations. The review authority may approve or deny an application for Minor Use Permit approval for a modification to development standards of this Zoning Ordinance for a residential project after first making the following findings. The review authority shall record the decision and the findings on which the decision is based.

1.    An individual protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act has a special need that would only be served by the requested modification to development standards for the proposed project;

2.    The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed modification are compatible with the existing and planned future land uses in the vicinity; and

3.    Alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of benefit, but would not require modifications to the development standards of this Zoning Ordinance, are infeasible for the proposed project.

H.    Conditions of approval. In approving a Use Permit or Minor Use Permit, the review authority may impose any reasonable conditions to ensure that the approval will comply with the findings required by Subsection F of this section. Any Use Permit granted for any medical or adult cannabis dispensary shall include as a condition the obtaining of a development/operating agreement with the City which shall require periodic review of performance and compliance as deemed appropriate by the City.

I.    Post review procedures.

17.62.080 Variance and Minor Variance

A.    Purpose. The Variance and Minor Variance provide a process for City consideration of requests to waive or modify certain standards of this Zoning Ordinance when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other physical features, the strict application of the development standards otherwise applicable to the property denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and in the same zone.

B.    Applicability. A Variance or Minor Variance may be granted to waive or modify any requirement of this Zoning Ordinance except allowed land uses, residential density, specific prohibitions (for example, prohibited signs), or procedural requirements.

b.    The Minor Variance is consistent with the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan.

c.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use would not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use or project, or detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City.

3.    Reasonable accommodation. The Review Authority may grant a Minor Use Permit for the site planning or development standards of this Zoning Ordinance in compliance with Section 17.62.070 (Use Permit and Minor Use Permit), based on the findings of Subsection 17.62.070.G (Findings and decision for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations).

G.    Conditions of approval. In approving a Variance or Minor Variance, the review authority:

1.    Shall impose conditions to ensure that the approval does not grant a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity, and the zone in which the property is located; and

3.    After it has been exercised, a planning permit shall remain valid and run with the land in compliance with Section 17.64.060, as long as a Building Permit is active for the project, the applicant has complied with all applicable conditions of approval, and after a final building inspection or certificate of occupancy has been granted.

4.    If a project is to be developed in approved phases, each subsequent phase shall be exercised within 12 months from the date that the previous phase was exercised, unless otherwise specified in the permit, or the permit shall expire and become void, except where an extension of time is approved in compliance with Subsection B of this section. If the project also involves the approval of a Tentative Map, the phasing shall be consistent with the Tentative Map and the permit shall be exercised before the expiration of the Tentative Map, or the permit shall expire and become void.

B.    Extensions of time. Upon written request by the applicant, the original permit review authority may extend the time for an approved planning permit to be exercised.

1.    Filing and review of request.

a.    Time for filing. The applicant shall file a written request for an extension of time with the Department at least 30 days before the expiration date, together with the filing fee required by the City’s Fee Schedule.

The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish, with substantial evidence, that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented exercising the permit.

c.    Public hearing. If the original approval required a public hearing, the original review authority shall hold a public hearing on a proposed extension of time, after providing notice of the public hearing in compliance with Chapter 17.78 (Public Hearings).

2.    Action on extension request. A permit may be extended for a maximum of one additional 12-month period beyond the expiration of the original approval; provided, that the review authority (e.g., Zoning Administrator or Commission) first finds that there have been no changes in the conditions or circumstances of the site or project so that there would have been grounds for disapproval of the original project. The review authority may grant an extension of less than the maximum time allowed by this section.

3.    Conditions of approval. The granting of a time extension in compliance with this section may include the review authority requiring additional conditions of approval as provided by the section of this chapter applicable to the specific permit type (e.g., Use Permit, Planned Development Permit).

C.    Effect of expiration. After the expiration of a planning permit in compliance with Subsection A.1 of this section, no further work shall be done on the site until a new planning permit and any required Building Permit or other City permits are first obtained.

1.    Is consistent with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance;

2.    Does not involve a feature of the project that was a basis for findings in a negative declaration or environmental impact report for the project;

3.    Does not involve a feature of the project that was specifically addressed or was a basis for conditions of approval for the project or that was a specific consideration by the review authority (e.g., the Director, Commission, or Council) in the project approval;

4.    Is minor and will not affect the aesthetics of the project; and

5.    Does not result in an expansion of the land use.

The Director may choose to refer any requested change to the original review authority for review and final action. See also Subsection 17.30.040.J for specific considerations on changes to approved landscape plans.

D.    Changes approved by original Review Authority. A proposed change that does not comply with the criteria in Subsection C of this section shall only be approved by the original review authority for the project through a new permit application processed in compliance with this Zoning Ordinance.


17.64.100 Periodic Review

The Zoning Administrator may periodically review any project authorized by planning permit approval for compliance with any applicable condition of approval. If any condition is being violated, the Zoning Administrator may schedule a public hearing before the original review authority to consider the revocation of the permit in compliance with Section 17.80.060 (Permit Revocation).

17.66.020 Application Requirements

A.    Applicant qualifications. Only a person who has legal or equitable interest in the real property that is the subject of a proposed development agreement, or their authorized agent, may apply for the approval of a development agreement. The Director may require an applicant to submit proof of their interest in the real property and of the authority of the agent to act for the applicant. Before processing the application, the Director shall obtain the opinion of the City Attorney as to the sufficiency of the applicant’s interest in the real property to enter into the agreement.

B.    Application contents.

1.    Forms and information. The City Manager shall prescribe the form for application, notice and documents provided for or required under this chapter for the preparation and implementation of a development agreement. The City Manager may require an applicant to submit information and supporting data as the City Manager considers necessary to process the application.

2.    Draft agreement. Each application shall be accompanied by a draft development agreement in the form required by the City.

3.    Fee. Each application shall include the processing fee deposit required by the City Fee Schedule.

C.    Application filing and processing. An application for a development agreement shall be filed and processed in compliance with Chapter 17.60 (Permit Application Filing and Processing).


17.66.030 Notices and Hearing

A.    Notice of intention. The Director shall give notice of intention to consider the adoption of a development agreement in addition to any other notice required by this Zoning Ordinance for other actions to be considered concurrently with the development agreement. The notice shall be given in the same manner as other public hearing notices, in compliance with Section 17.78.020 (Notice of Hearing).

B.    Public hearings. The Commission shall conduct at least one public hearing on a proposed development agreement prior to making a recommendation to the Council on the agreement, and the Council shall conduct at least one hearing prior to a decision on the application. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided, and the hearing shall be conducted in compliance with Chapter 17.78 (Public Hearings). The failure to receive notice by any person entitled to notice by law or this Zoning Ordinance does not affect the authority of the City to enter into a development agreement.

C.    Irregularity in proceedings. No action, inaction or recommendation regarding a proposed development agreement shall be held void or invalid, or be set aside by a court by reason of any error, irregularity, informality, neglect or omission (error) as to any matter pertaining to petition, application, notice, finding, record, hearing, report, recommendation, or any matters of procedure whatever unless after an examination of the entire case, including the evidence, the court is of the opinion that the error complained of was prejudicial and that by reason of the error the complaining party sustained and suffered substantial injury, and that a different result would have been probable if the error had not occurred or existed. There is no presumption that error is prejudicial or that injury was done if error is shown.


17.66.040 Standards of Review, Findings, and Decision

A.    Commission recommendation. After a hearing, the Commission shall make its recommendation regarding the development agreement in writing to the Council. The recommendation shall include the Commission’s determination, and reasons for the determination, as to whether the proposed development agreement:

1.    Is consistent with the objectives, policies, general land uses and programs specified in the General Plan and any applicable specific plan;

2.    Is compatible with the uses authorized in, and the regulations prescribed for, the zoning district where the site is located;

3.    Is in conformity with public convenience, general welfare and good land use practice;

4.    Will not be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare; and

5.    Will not adversely affect the orderly development of property or the preservation of property values.

B.    Adverse decision by Commission. If the Commission recommends against adoption of the development agreement, the Council shall not be required to take further action unless an interested party requests a hearing by filing a written request with the City Clerk within five days after the Commission recommendation is filed with the Council. Notice of the hearing shall be given in compliance with Section 17.78.020 (Notice of Hearing).

C.    Decision by Council.

1.    After the Council completes its public hearing, it may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the development agreement. It may, but need not, refer a matter not previously considered by the Commission during its hearing back to the Commission for report and recommendation. The Commission may, but need not, hold a public hearing on a matter referred back to it by the Council.

2.    The Council shall not approve the development agreement unless it finds that the provisions of the agreement are consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan.

D.    Approval of development agreement. Council approval of a development agreement shall be by the adoption of an ordinance. The Council may enter into the agreement after the ordinance approving the development agreement takes effect.


17.66.050 Amendment or Cancellation

A.    Initiation of amendment or cancellation. Either party may propose an amendment to or cancellation of an effective development agreement, in whole or in part.

B.    Procedure. The procedure for proposing and adopting an amendment to, or cancellation in whole or in part of a development agreement shall be the same as the procedure for entering into an agreement as provided by this chapter, except as otherwise provided in the development agreement.


17.66.060 Recordation

A.    Within 10 days after the City enters into the development agreement, the City Clerk shall have the agreement recorded with the county recorder.

B.    If the parties to the agreement or their successors in interest amend or cancel the agreement, or if the City terminates or modifies the agreement for failure of the applicant to comply in good faith with the terms or conditions of the agreement, the City Clerk shall have notice of the action recorded with the county recorder.


17.66.070 Periodic Review

A.    Review required. Every development agreement approved and executed in compliance with this section shall be subject to annual City review, during the full term of the agreement. Appropriate fees to cover the City’s costs to conduct the periodic reviews shall be collected from the applicant.

B.    Purpose of review. The purpose of the periodic review shall be to determine whether the applicant or its successor-in-interest has complied in good faith with the terms of the development agreement. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant or its successor to demonstrate compliance to the full satisfaction of, and in a manner prescribed by, the City.

C.    Initiation of review. The applicant shall contact the Director to initiate the required periodic review no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of each 12-month period after the execution of the development agreement.

D.    Action based on noncompliance. If, as a result of periodic review the Council finds and determines, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the applicant or its successor-in-interest has not complied in good faith with the terms or conditions of the agreement, the Council may order, after a noticed public hearing, that the agreement be terminated or modified.


17.66.080 Modification or Termination

A.    Proceedings upon modification or termination. If, upon a finding under Section 17.66.050, the City determines to proceed with modification or termination of the agreement, the City shall give notice to the property owner of its intention to do so. The notice shall contain:

1.    The time and place of the hearing;

2.    A statement as to whether or not and in what respects the City proposes to terminate or to modify the development agreement;

3.    Other information that the City considers necessary to inform the property owner of the nature of the proceeding.

B.    Hearing on modification or termination. At the time and place set for the hearing on modification or termination, the property owner shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The Council may impose those conditions to the action it takes as it considers necessary to protect the interests of the City. The decision of the Council is final. (Ord. 1025 § 20, 2015)

17.68.020 Applicability

No person shall alter the exterior of, construct improvements to, or demolish any historic structure except in compliance with requirements of this chapter, which shall include the analysis required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to determine historic significance, and the effects of the proposed alterations.


17.68.030 Historic Landmark Designation

The Council may designate an improvement, natural feature, or site as an historic landmark and any area within the City as an historic district in compliance with this section, based on the Council’s evaluation of the age of the affected structures, distinguishing characteristics, distinct geographical area, familiar visual feature, significant achievement, and/or other distinctive feature.

A.    Procedure. The designation of an historic landmark or district, or the removal of the designation of an historic landmark or district, shall comply with the procedure established by this Zoning Ordinance for amendments in Chapter 17.74, including public notice and a hearing in compliance with state law, and a final decision by the Council.

B.    Permit issuance during nomination process. No permit for any improvement or structure within a proposed historic district or relative to a nominated historic landmark shall be issued while the nomination process is pending.

C.    Placement on historic register. The nominated district, site, or structure shall be placed on the City’s historic register after being officially accepted by the Council, and the designation shall be recorded for each affected parcel in the office of the Monterey County recorder.

D.    Removal from the historic register. A designated local resource may only be removed from the City’s historic register in the following cases:

1.    When a Certificate of Appropriateness has been approved for demolition; or

2.    After five years of being designated, the property owner may submit a de-nomination statement outlining reasons for removal from the register. The de-nomination request shall be processed in compliance with the procedure for nomination listed above. The de-nomination statement must provide written proof and documentation that the findings used to designate the structure were largely in error, or that new information has been discovered, material to the decision to designate the resource, which was not discovered through the exercise of due diligence at the time of the original designation.

If delisting a designated resource is proposed, environmental review shall be required in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as it relates to historic resources.


17.68.040 Certificate of Appropriateness – General Requirements

A.    Purpose. A Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) is intended to protect structures, improvements, natural features, objects, and areas of architectural, cultural, economic, historic, political, and social importance from unnecessary and/or inappropriate alteration, demolition, or removal.

B.    Applicability. A COA is required for the alteration, demolition, moving, or removal of any landmark or structure designated on the City’s Historic Register, any individual cultural resource or any contributing cultural resource within a historic district, and for any alteration, demolition, moving, or removal of any potential cultural resource identified through the City’s review of a planning and/or construction permit application or CEQA review, by the City, any agent of the City, or a private party. A COA:

1.    Shall be required in addition to any other permits required by this Zoning Ordinance; and

2.    Shall accompany any permit or any work otherwise altering the architectural features or appearance of the resource.

Alteration shall mean any act or process, through private or public action, that changes the specified character defining a cultural resource or significant physical features or architectural appearance of a cultural resource, including the reconstruction, new construction additions, repair, restoration, rehabilitation, replacement or removal of any resource.

Changes in character include modification of a structure, architectural detail or visual characteristic (e.g., grading, paint color, surface texture), surface paving, the addition of new structures, the cutting or removal of trees, landscaping and other natural features, the disturbance of archaeological sites or areas, and the placement or removal of any significant objects (e.g., fences, landscaping and accessories, light fixtures, plaques, signs, steps, street furniture, and walls) affecting the significant visual or historical qualities of the property.

When approving a COA, the review authority may permit a waiver of development standards for designated cultural resources only.

C.    Application preparation and filing. A Certificate of Appropriateness application shall be filed with the Department. The application shall include plans and specifications showing the proposed change in architectural appearance, color and texture of materials, the proposed architectural design of the structure, and any additional information required by Director. The application shall also show the relationship of the proposed work to the surrounding environs. A COA application may propose discreet alterations of a cultural resource or may propose a long-term plan of rehabilitation and preservation of a particular resource.

D.    Application for demolition. An application for demolition of a historic resource, a structure within a historic district, or for new construction on a cultural resource property shall include plans and specifications for the proposed new structure or addition and shall include information pertaining to landscaping, massing, relationship to site and streetscape, scale, and signs. The application shall be accompanied by any other information that the Director determines is required for an informed evaluation of the proposed work.

E.    Application for a site within a historic district. Both individual resources and contributing resources are subject to all Certificate of Appropriateness findings and requirements. Noncontributing resources are not subject to the requirements of this section, but will be reviewed to ensure that proposed development on the noncontributing property will not degrade the historical character of the historic district. If noncontributing resources are proposed to be demolished, a COA shall be required to ensure that the proposed development will not degrade the historical character of the historic district.

F.    CEQA. The review and approval of a COA shall require environmental review in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as it relates to historic resources.


17.68.050 Certificate of Appropriateness – Review and Approval

A public hearing shall be scheduled for a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) requiring Commission approval as soon as practicable after receipt of the application.

A.    Public hearing notice. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in compliance with the requirements in Chapter 17.78 (Public Hearings).

B.    Review and approval.

1.    Criteria for review. In evaluating a COA application, the review authority shall use any applicable design guidelines, and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, and shall consider the factors (e.g., the existing and proposed architectural style, arrangement, color, design, materials, and texture to be used) with regard to the original distinguishing architectural characteristics of the cultural resource. In addition, the Zoning Administrator may require that the proposed work be reviewed by a preservation architect. The actual work shall be completed by a preservation contractor or someone with demonstrated expertise in the field. Wherever feasible, the state Historic Building Code (SHBC) and the Uniform Code for Building Conservation (UCBC) shall be used in permitting any alteration to a cultural resource.

2.    Authority of Planning Commission. The Commission may approve or deny a COA, in whole or in part. Notice of the Commission decision shall be sent to the applicant, owner and occupants of the property within 10 days of the date of the Commission decision.

3.    Authority of Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may approve a COA for proposed minor architectural elements and details, paint or other colorings or finishes, minor site improvements, or signage. Zoning Administrator approval of a COA shall require making all of the findings required by Subsection D of this section, but does not require a public hearing or public notice. The Zoning Administrator may also approve fences, replacement of window glass, replacement in-kind of windows, doors, roofs, or exterior materials, or proposals which are determined by the Zoning Administrator to be ordinary maintenance or repair, and which are conducted in a manner that preserves the archaeological, cultural, and historic value of the cultural resource through conformance with any applicable prescriptive standards and/or design guidelines adopted by the City, and/or the guidelines of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. Minor changes or modifications to a COA can be approved by the Zoning Administrator, even if the Zoning Administrator was not the approving body. The Zoning Administrator may refer any COA application to the Commission for hearing and decision.

C.    Investigation for COA. The review authority may require the applicant to furnish material evidence, as needed, supporting the request for alteration, demolition, or removal of a cultural resource or to give testimony and furnish evidence of any or all of the following, where appropriate:

1.    Cost estimates for the proposed alteration, construction, demolition, or removal, and an estimate of the cost(s) that would be incurred to comply with the requirements of the COA;

2.    A written report from a licensed structural engineer with experience and expertise with historic structures and rehabilitation, as to structural integrity and suitability for rehabilitation;

3.    Estimated market value of the property in its current condition and estimated market value after completion of the proposed alteration, construction, demolition, or removal as compared with any changes required by the COA;

4.    In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an appraiser, architect, developer, real estate consultant, or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or adaptive reuse of the existing structure on the property and its market value for continued use after rehabilitation;

5.    For income-producing properties, information on annual gross income, current assessed property valuations, current property value appraisals, depreciation, reductions, and annual cash flow after debt service, operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, and other information considered necessary by the review authority to determine whether substantial evidence of economic hardship exists;

6.    Remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing secured by the property for the previous two years;

7.    All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner or applicant in connection with the financing, ownership, or purchase of the subject property;

8.    Amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any, between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the property was purchased, and any terms of financing between the seller and buyer. Additionally, any listing of the property for sale or rent, prices asked and offers received, if any, within the previous two years;

9.    Assessed value of the property according to the two most recent assessments;

10.    Real estate taxes for the previous two years;

11.    Form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for-profit or nonprofit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture, or other; and

12.    Other information considered necessary by the review authority for a determination as to whether the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the owner.

D.    Findings for Certificate of Appropriateness.

1.    Alterations, generally. A COA shall be issued for a proposed alteration only if the review authority first finds that:

a.    The proposed work will neither adversely affect the significant architectural features of the cultural resource nor adversely affect the character or historic, architectural, aesthetic interest, or value of the cultural resource and its site; and

b.    The proposed work conforms to any prescriptive standards and design guidelines adopted by the City for the particular resource, and to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, and does not adversely affect the character of the cultural resource; and

c.    In the case of construction of a new improvement upon a cultural resource property, the use and design of the improvement shall not adversely affect, and shall be compatible with, the use and design of existing cultural resources within the same historic district; and

2.    Alterations found not to be adverse. The effect of alteration on a cultural resource that would otherwise be found to be adverse may be considered not adverse for the purpose of this section when the alteration is:

a.    Limited to the rehabilitation or restoration of improvements; and

b.    Conducted in a manner that preserves the archaeological, cultural, and historic value of the cultural resource through conformance with any prescriptive standards adopted by the City for that cultural resource, cultural resource property, or historic district, and the guidelines of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.

E.    Conditions for Certificate of Appropriateness. The review authority may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness subject to any condition deemed necessary or desirable to effect the purposes of this chapter. The conditions shall be covenants running with the land.

F.    Period of validity of Certificate of Appropriateness. A COA shall become void unless construction is commenced within 12 months from the date of approval. A COA may be renewed for 12 months by applying to the Department a minimum of 30 days before the expiration of the certificate. The review authority may grant an extension for another 12-month period. A COA may be extended only twice, and a new COA is required thereafter. If the project is not completed within 12 months after the expiration of the last Building Permit, a new Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required to complete the work.


17.68.060 Certificate of Appropriateness – Proposed Demolition

The following requirements shall apply in cases involving proposed demolition, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this chapter:

A.    Required findings. The Commission shall approve a COA for the demolition of a cultural resource only in conjunction with the concurrent approval of a proposed replacement project, and only after first making all of the following findings:

1.    The cultural resource cannot be remodeled, rehabilitated or reused in a manner that would allow a reasonable use;

2.    Denial of the application will diminish the value of the subject property so as to leave substantially no value;

3.    The cultural resource cannot be remodeled, rehabilitated, or reused in a manner that would allow a reasonable rate of return; and

B.    Justifiable hardships. Personal, family or financial difficulties, loss of prospective profits and Building Code violations shall not justify the issuance of a COA.

C.    Economic hardship. Demolition not in compliance with the findings required by Subsection A of this section may be approved only in cases of economic hardship. Economic hardship is defined as a substantial cost to the property owner that is patently unreasonable in comparison to the benefit conferred to the community should the owner be limited to following the guidelines for preserving or protecting the property. In order to approve demolition on the basis of economic hardship, the Commission shall first find all of the following:

1.    Disapproval would substantially diminish the value of the property;

2.    The sale or rental of the property is impractical when compared to the cost of holding the property for uses allowed in the subject zoning district;

3.    An adaptive reuse study has been conducted and found that utilization of the property for lawful purposes is prohibited or impractical;

4.    Disapproval would unreasonably damage the owner of the property in comparison to the benefit conferred on the community;

5.    All means involving City sponsored incentives (e.g., amendments to this Zoning Ordinance, Building Code modifications, financial assistance, and/or grants) have been explored to relieve possible economic hardship;

6.    Without approval of the proposed construction, demolition, exterior alteration, remodeling, or removal, the reasonable use of or return from a designated landmark or property within an historic district will be denied a property owner; and

7.    In the case of a proposed demolition, the Zoning Administrator shall make an additional finding that the designated landmark cannot be remodeled or rehabilitated in a manner that would allow a reasonable use of or return from the property to the owners.

D.    Effect of demolition. If approval of a COA will result in the demolition of a cultural resource, the applicant shall be required to memorialize the resource proposed for demolition in compliance with the standards of the Historic American Building Survey (HABS). The documentation may include an archaeological survey, floor plans, measured drawings, photographs, or other documentation specified by the Commission.

When appropriate, the Commission may require that a memorialization of the resource be incorporated into the proposed redevelopment of the site including the following:

1.    Book or pamphlet;

2.    Photographic display;

3.    Small museum or exhibit;

4.    Use of original fixtures; and/or

5.    Other methods deemed appropriate by the Commission. (Ord. 1025 § 21, 2015)


17.68.070 Certificate of Appropriateness – Disaster Damage

A Certificate of Appropriateness is required to alter, add to, repair, restore, reconstruct, demolish or replace a disaster-damaged cultural resource in compliance with this Zoning Ordinance, except where the Building Official determines that an unsafe or dangerous condition exists in compliance with Section 17.68.100 (Unsafe or Dangerous Condition).


17.68.080 Adaptive Re-Use and Other Rehabilitation Incentives

A.    Purpose. The rehabilitation incentives provided by this section are intended to encourage the maintenance, preservation, and rehabilitation of cultural resources in the City, recognizing that maintaining and rehabilitating a cultural resource places increased burdens on the affected property owner. These rehabilitation incentives are intended to reduce those burdens so that property owners will be encouraged to invest in maintaining the City’s cultural resources.

B.    Applicability. Upon designation of a structure or improvement as a designated cultural resource, the property owner may apply to the Council for aid and assistance in rehabilitating the resource. The application for rehabilitation incentives is considered the necessary planning permit; the applicant need not submit additional applications for other permits required by this Zoning Ordinance, but shall comply with any City requirements for a Building Permit, Grading Permit, etc.

C.    Types of incentives allowed. The Council may grant any or all of the following rehabilitation incentives:

1.    Adaptive reuse, including the approval of a change to a land use that is not otherwise allowed in the zone, but which is permitted in other zones;

2.    Mills Act Agreements;

3.    Permit fee waivers; and/or

4.    Reduction and/or substantial modification in the development standards of this Zoning Ordinance.

D.    Application content. Applications shall include the information required by the Director.

E.    Review and approval of rehabilitation incentives.

1.    Hearing and action. The Commission shall hold a public hearing to determine the eligibility of a property for rehabilitation incentives and shall, by resolution, approve or deny any incentives. The action of the Commission on a Mills Act agreement shall be a recommendation to the Council; the Council has final approval authority in Mills Act decisions. Public notice for the hearing shall comply with state law.

2.    Required findings for approval. The Commission may recommend or grant rehabilitation incentives, only after first making all of the following findings:

a.    Findings for all incentives.

(1)    Each incentive to be granted serves to compensate the property owner for the increased burden, in terms of maintenance and expense, that rehabilitation would entail;

(2)    No approved incentive would impair the aesthetic, architectural, or historic integrity of the resource; and

(3)    No proposed incentive would be detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare.

b.    Findings for adaptive reuse. In addition to the above findings, the Commission shall make the following findings for the approval of adaptive reuse:

(1)    The change of use would occupy no more floor area than the original use;

(2)    The proposed use would not significantly impair the physical character of the area in which it is located; and

(3)    The change of use would result in substantial restoration of the significant and architectural features or exterior architectural appearance of the resource, and/or will result in a maintenance plan that will ensure the upkeep and continued maintenance of the resource over the expected life of the project.

3.    Conditions of approval. In approving rehabilitation incentives, the Commission may impose any conditions of approval deemed necessary to ensure compatibility between the new use and the surrounding area.


17.68.090 Duty to Maintain and Repair

The owner, occupant, or other person in actual charge of a cultural resource shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of the improvement, structure, and all interior portions thereof whose maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of any exterior architectural feature and any other specifically designated features of the property. If periodic maintenance and upkeep is not done, and the resource falls into disrepair, the fact that it is in disrepair may not be used as justification for demolition or any other alteration which would cause adverse effect as defined in this chapter.


17.68.100 Unsafe or Dangerous Condition

In the case of damage to a structure that is the result of an isolated incident, the Zoning Administrator may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for a structure for which there is a threat of imminent hazard as determined by the Building Official, without public notice. In the case of widespread damage to structures throughout the City (as in the case of an earthquake), the Zoning Administrator shall stay all notices to demolish designated or potential cultural resources, including all structures in designated or potential districts, until a structural engineer with expertise in the restoration of historic structures has evaluated the nature and extent of the damage to each structure, and recommended steps to stabilize each structure. The City shall stabilize or isolate damaged structures to permit persons with appropriate expertise to further evaluate the damage. In cases where a structural engineer with expertise in the restoration of historic structures has determined that the building cannot be stabilized, then the Zoning Administrator may issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the demolition of one or more structures.

1.    Residential uses. No additional parking spaces shall be required; provided the change does not increase the number of dwelling units, increase the existing floor area, or eliminate the only portion of the site that can be used for the required or existing parking or access.

2.    Nonresidential uses.

a.    The number of existing parking spaces shall be maintained on the site and additional parking shall be provided in compliance with Chapter 17.34 (Parking and Loading) for any additional floor area.

A.    Termination by discontinuance. If a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a conforming structure is discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days or longer, all rights to legal nonconforming status shall terminate.

1.    The Director shall base a determination of discontinuance on evidence including the removal of equipment, furniture, machinery, structures, or other components of the nonconforming use, disconnected or discontinued utilities, failure to maintain a current business (operations) tax license on the site, and/or no business records to document continued operation.

2.    The Zoning Administrator may grant a Minor Use Permit in compliance with Section 17.62.070 to allow an extension of the 180-day period for a period not to exceed an additional 180 days if the Zoning Administrator first finds that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant prevented the timely reestablishment of the use.

3.    Once legal nonconforming status is terminated, any further use of the site or structure shall comply with the requirements of the applicable zoning district and all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.

B.    Termination by destruction. Nonconforming status shall terminate if a nonconforming structure, or a conforming structure occupied by a nonconforming use, is involuntarily damaged or destroyed; except as provided by Section 17.72.030 for residential dwellings, and except as follows:

1.    If the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of the structure is 60 percent or less of the assessed value of the structure immediately before damage, the structure may be restored to no more than the same size and use, and the use continued, if the restoration is started within 12 months of the date of damage and is diligently pursued to completion.

2.    Minor Use Permit approval shall be required if the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of the structure is more than 60 percent of the assessed value of the structure immediately before the damage. Minor Use Permit approval shall require a finding, in addition to those contained in Section 17.62.070, that the benefit to the public health, safety, or welfare exceeds the detriment inherent in the restoration and continuance of a nonconformity.


17.72.050 Nonconforming Parcels

A.    Legal building site. A nonconforming parcel that does not comply with the applicable minimum parcel size requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall be considered a legal building site if it meets at least one of the following criteria, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director by evidence furnished by the applicant:

1.    Approved subdivision. The parcel was created by a recorded subdivision;

2.    Individual parcel legally created by deed. The parcel is under one ownership, and was legally created by a recorded deed before the effective date of the zoning amendment that made the parcel nonconforming; or

3.    Partial government acquisition. The parcel was created in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, but was made nonconforming when a portion was acquired by a governmental entity so that the parcel size is decreased not more than 20 percent and the yard facing a public right-of-way was decreased not more than 50 percent.

B.    Subdivision of a nonconforming parcel prohibited. No subdivision shall be approved that will increase the nonconformity of an existing parcel or any nonconforming use on the parcel.


17.72.060 Nonconforming Due to Lack of a Use Permit

A.    Conformity of uses requiring a Use Permit. A use lawfully existing without the approval of a Use Permit or Minor Use Permit that would now be required by this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed conforming only to the extent of its previous lawful use (e.g., maintaining the same site area boundaries, hours of operation).

B.    Previous planning permits in effect. A use that was authorized by a Use Permit or Minor Use Permit but is not allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in its current location may continue, but only in compliance with the original Use Permit or Minor Use Permit.

18.01.010 Purpose of the coastal implementation plan.

The document codified in this title establishes the city of Seaside coastal implementation plan representing the coastal zoning ordinance for the city of Seaside’s local coastal program (LCP), prepared in accordance with the California Coastal Act (CCA) of 1976. As provided by the CCA, an LCP consists of two major components: the land use plan (LUP) and the coastal implementation plan (CIP). Whereas the LUP designates the kinds, location, and intensity of land and water uses and presents applicable resource protection and development policies, the CIP provides development regulations for specific coastal zone activities needed to carry out the LUP. Accordingly, the city of Seaside CIP describes the various implementation measures needed to carry out the city of Seaside LUP.

The purpose of this title is to implement the city’s LUP and to protect and promote the public health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the city. More specifically, this title is intended:

	•    	To encourage public access to the lake and beach shorelines, while minimizing adverse impacts on dune and marsh habitats and ensuring public safety from water run-up hazards.

	•    	To maximize, to the extent feasible, the recreational potential of the Laguna Grande, Roberts Lake, Beach, and Del Monte subareas, while at the same time preventing damage to or minimizing the loss of major natural habitat areas.

	•    	To minimize safety hazards and impacts from natural and man-induced hazards.

	•    	To preserve and enhance coastal vistas, views, and view corridors while recognizing the rights of private property owners and the demands for visitor-serving facilities.

	•    	To minimize dredging and filling unrelated to water quality considerations, while recognizing the recreational needs for open space.

	•    	To provide coastal access, visitor-serving facilities, and public improvements within the funding constraints of the public sector.

	•    	To allow land uses which respond to the institutional and natural constraints of the land and which minimize disturbance of the surrounding land area.

	•    	To preserve and enhance the natural resources, environmental quality, and community character of the coastal zone.

	•    	To promote the development of runoff control measures capable of minimizing water quality impacts, including from siltation and to Laguna Grande and the Monterey Bay.

(Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)

This title shall be administered by: the Seaside city planning commission, referred to as the “commission”; the zoning administrator, the deputy city manager – resource management services department, referred to as the “deputy city manager”; and the resource management services department, hereafter referred to as the “department.” (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.01.060 Conflict with other provisions.

If there is a conflict between a provision of this title and a provision of the general plan, or any other city-adopted plan, resolution, or ordinance not included in this title, the regulations outlined in this title shall prevail. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.01.070 Severability.

If any chapter, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or other portion of this title is for any reason held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the title. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)

This designation is appropriate in a portion of the Del Monte subarea consistent and compatible with the West Broadway Urban Village specific plan. The city may consider identification and development of transit parking or supporting uses as a component of this designation within the coastal zone. This designation is intended to accommodate an active mixed-use corridor along Del Monte Boulevard as identified in the West Broadway Urban Village specific plan.

	CCRG	Coastal Regional Commercial	To establish areas with existing regional commercial uses that provide employment-generating opportunities for the community.

	CCH	Coastal Heavy Commercial	To establish areas with existing heavy commercial uses (i.e., automotive repair shops, contractor yards, light manufacturing, utility substations, and warehousing).

	CTC	Coastal Transportation Corridor	To accommodate motorized and nonmotorized forms of transportation.

B. Designation of Coastal Zoning Districts. The designations, locations, and boundaries of districts are set forth on the city of Seaside coastal zoning map, originally dated April 28, 2010. The city of Seaside coastal zoning map is on file with the city clerk and is illustrated in Figures 1a and 1b. This map may be amended by ordinance of the planning commission subject to certification by the California Coastal Commission.

(5) State Highway 1 right-of-way is owned by Caltrans. Railroad right-of-way is owned by Southern Pacific Railroad. Bike path improvements may be subject to TAMC requirements.

(6) The identified site development standards represent maximum and minimum thresholds for compliance, and not entitlements to those exact dimensions. Depending on actual site constraints, standards that are less than the maximum or more than the minimum standards may be required to ensure adequate coastal resource protection (e.g., a structure may be required to be limited to a lesser height than the maximum allowed height to adequately protect public views).

(7) Refer to SMC 18.02.070 for special development standards for each subarea.

A. Parking Requirements.

1. General Parking Requirements. These requirements are intended to ensure that suitable off-street parking and loading facilities are provided for all uses and developments, and that the facilities are properly designed, attractive, and located to be unobtrusive while meeting the needs of the specific use. Each land use and structure, including a change or expansion of a land use or structure, shall provide suitable off-street parking and loading facilities. A land use shall not be commenced and a structure shall not be occupied until the parking and loading improvements required by this chapter are completed and approved.

a. Parking and Loading Spaces to Be Permanent. Each parking and loading space shall be permanently available, marked, and maintained for parking or loading purposes for the use it is intended to serve; provided, that the approval of a limited term permit may allow the temporary use of a parking or loading space for other purposes.

i. Subdivision of Property. No subdivision shall be approved that has the effect of reducing existing on-site parking below the minimum number of spaces required by this chapter.

ii. Lot Restriping. A parking lot shall not be restriped to reduce the number of parking spaces below the minimum required by this chapter.

b. Parking and Loading to be Unrestricted. A lessee, owner, tenant, or other person having control of the operation of a premises for which parking or loading spaces are required by this chapter shall not prevent, prohibit, or restrict authorized persons from using the spaces without the prior approval of the zoning administrator.

c. Vehicles for Sale. No vehicle, trailer, or other personal property shall be parked on private property for the purpose of displaying the vehicle, trailer, or other personal property for hire, rental, or sale, unless the applicable zone allows the use, and the person or business at that location is licensed to sell vehicles, trailers, or other personal property.

d. Recreational Vehicle (RV) Parking.

i. The storage (parking for any period longer than seventy-two hours) of a recreational vehicle (RV) and/or boat in a residential zone shall be allowed only when all portions of the vehicle or boat are located entirely within the property boundaries and do not extend into the public right-of-way.

ii. Parking within setback areas shall also comply with setback requirements and exceptions – limitations on the use of setbacks.

e. Cargo Containers. No shipping container (e.g., metal “Seatrain” or other similar cargo container) shall be stored within a designated parking space or loading area.

2. Number of Parking Spaces Required. Each land use shall be provided the number of off-street parking spaces required.

a. Parking Requirements by Land Use.

i. Each land use shall provide the number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 4, except where a greater number of spaces is authorized through minor use permit or use permit approval.

ii. A land use not specifically listed in Table 4 shall provide parking as required by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall use the requirements in Table 4 as a guide in determining the appropriate number of off-street parking spaces required for the use.

iii. In any case where Table 4 expresses a parking requirement based on floor area in square feet (for example: one space for each one thousand sf), “sf” means square feet of gross interior leaseable floor area, unless stated otherwise (e.g., ground area).

iv. A single use with accessory components shall provide parking for each component. For example, a hotel with a gift shop shall provide the parking spaces required by Table 4 for a hotel (e.g., the guest rooms), and for a gift shop.

	Self-service car washes	1 space for each wash bay.

	Theaters (e.g., movie)	1 space for each 4 seats or 1 space for each 100 sf, whichever would yield more spaces.

b. Expansion of Structure, Change in Use. When a structure is enlarged, or when a change in its use requires more off-street parking than the previous use, additional parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with this chapter.

c. Multi-Tenant Sites.

i. A site with multiple tenants (e.g., two or more) shall provide the aggregate number of parking spaces required for each separate use (e.g., sum of the separate requirements for each use), except where the site is developed as an integrated shopping center with shared parking and no spaces reserved for a particular use. In this instance, the parking shall be provided as required by Table 4 for a shopping center.

ii. When a multi-tenant center includes one or more uses that will need more parking than retail uses (e.g., a health/fitness facility, restaurant, or theater) additional parking shall be required for the nonretail use unless a parking reduction is approved in compliance with reduction of parking requirements, below.

d. Alternate Use of Parking Areas Prohibited. Off-street parking areas shall not be used for the repair, servicing, or storage of vehicles or materials, the sale of any goods or services, or any other work area.

e. Recreational Vehicle (RV) Parking Spaces. Off-street recreational vehicle (RV) parking spaces shall be provided as follows for retail uses, shopping centers, and visitor attractions that are required by this chapter to provide forty or more off-street parking spaces.

i. RV parking spaces shall be provided at a minimum ratio of one RV space for each forty off-street vehicle parking spaces, or fraction thereof, required by this chapter.

ii. Each RV parking space shall be designed as a pull-through space with a minimum width of twelve feet and a minimum length of forty feet, with fourteen feet of vertical clearance.

f. Rounding of Calculations. If a fractional number is obtained in calculations performed in compliance with this chapter, one additional parking space shall be required for a fractional unit of one-half or above, and no additional space shall be required for a fractional unit of less than one-half.

g. Estimating Spaces. Where fixed seating is provided as benches, bleachers, pews, or similar seating, a seat shall be defined as twenty-four inches of bench space for the purpose of calculating the number of parking spaces required by Table 4. Whenever parking requirements are based on the number of employees, calculations shall be based on the largest number of employees on duty at any one time.

h. Nonconforming Parking. A use or structure with nonconforming off-street parking may be physically changed or undergo a change in use in compliance with the following provisions:

i. The number of existing parking spaces shall be maintained on the site and additional parking shall be provided in compliance with this chapter for any additional floor area.

ii. If the use of the structure is changed to one that requires more parking than the previous use, only the difference between the number of parking spaces required for the previous use and those required for the new use shall be added.

iii. The change shall not eliminate the only portion of the site that can be used for the required or existing parking or access.

i. Reduction of Parking Requirements. No off-street parking facility shall be reduced in capacity or in area without sufficient additional capacity or additional area being provided in order to comply with the parking regulations unless they meet the following requirements:

i. Shared On-Site Parking. Where two or more adjacent nonresidential uses have distinct and differing peak parking usage periods (e.g., a theater and a bank), a reduction in the required number of parking spaces may be allowed through use permit approval. Approval shall also require a recorded covenant running with the land, recorded by the owner of the parking lot, guaranteeing that the required parking will be maintained exclusively for the use served for the duration of the use.

ii. Reduction of Required Parking. The number of parking spaces may be reduced through the granting of a minor use permit based on quantitative information provided by the applicant that documents the need for fewer spaces (e.g., sales receipts, documentation of customer frequency, information on parking standards required for the proposed land use by other cities, etc.).

j. Waiver of Requirements. The parking requirements of this chapter may be waived through use permit approval when a nonconforming structure is proposed for rehabilitation if the planning commission first finds that the existing structure location, parcel size, or topography renders the requirement unreasonable.

3. Additional Parking Provisions.

a. Disabled Parking Requirements. Each nonresidential development shall provide the following number of parking spaces for the disabled: One parking space for the disabled shall be provided within a parking lot with less than twenty-five spaces; and larger parking lots (e.g., with twenty-five or more spaces) shall include additional spaces for the disabled as required by state or federal law. Parking spaces required for the disabled shall count toward compliance with the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter.

Each parking space for the disabled shall have a minimum width of fourteen feet. All spaces for the disabled shall be located so that: The spaces provide easy access from the closest parking area to the major entrances of the use for which they are provided; the disabled individual is not compelled to wheel or walk behind parked cars other than his or her own; and a pedestrian way accessible to physically disabled persons shall be provided from each parking space to related facilities including curb cuts and/or ramps.

b. Bicycle Parking Requirements. Each multifamily project and nonresidential land use shall provide bicycle parking. A multifamily project shall provide bicycle parking spaces equal to a minimum of ten percent of the required vehicle spaces, unless separate secured garage space is provided for each unit. The bicycle spaces shall be distributed throughout the project. A nonresidential project (e.g., office, retail, etc.) shall provide bicycle parking spaces equal to a minimum of five percent of the required vehicle spaces, distributed to serve customers and employees of the project.

Each bicycle parking space shall include a stationary parking device to adequately secure the bicycle, shall be a minimum of two feet in width and six feet in length, with a minimum of seven feet of overhead clearance, and shall be conveniently located and generally within proximity to the main entrance of a structure.

c. Motorcycle Parking Requirements. A parking lot with fifty or more vehicle parking spaces shall provide motorcycle parking spaces conveniently located near the main entrance to the primary structure and accessed by the same access aisles that serve the vehicle parking spaces in the parking lot. A minimum of one motorcycle parking space shall be provided for each fifty vehicle spaces or fraction thereof. Motorcycle spaces shall have minimum dimensions of four feet by seven feet.

d. Public Access Parking. Public access parking and related facilities shall be provided at and/or adjacent to all identified beach, park, and open space areas commensurate with demand for such facilities and the need to provide post-construction water quality measures including low impact design (LID) strategies identified in the water quality section in SMC 18.02.070(G)(5)(b).

4. Parking Design and Development Standards. Required parking areas shall be designed, constructed, and properly maintained in compliance with the following requirements:

a. Parking Lots Access and Circulation. Parking areas shall provide suitable maneuvering area so that vehicles enter from and exit to a public street in a forward direction only. Parking lots shall be designed to prevent access at any point other than at designated access drives. Multifamily dwelling units are exempt from this requirement, unless specifically required by conditions of a discretionary permit. This requirement does not apply to alleys, unless so specified in a specific zone. A nonresidential development that provides fifty or more parking spaces shall have access driveways that are not intersected by a parking aisle, parking space, or another access driveway for a minimum distance of twenty feet from the street right-of-way, to provide a queuing or stacking area for vehicles entering and exiting the parking area. A minimum unobstructed clearance height of fourteen feet shall be maintained above areas accessible to vehicles within nonresidential developments.

b. Location of Parking. Parking shall be located on the same parcel as the uses served or within three hundred feet of the parcel if shared parking or public parking facilities are used to meet parking requirements. A greater distance may be authorized by the commission through use permit approval. Parking may be located within a required side or rear setback; provided, that it is separated from the side or rear property line by a minimum five-foot wide landscaped area.

c. Parking Lot Access on Adjacent Sites. Developments are encouraged to provide on-site vehicle access to parking areas on adjacent properties to provide for convenience, safety and efficient circulation. A joint access agreement running with the land shall be recorded by the owners of the abutting properties guaranteeing the continued availability of the shared access between the properties.

d. Parking Stall and Lot Dimensions. The standard parking shall be a minimum of nine feet wide and nineteen feet long. However, depending on the stall orientation and angle the length and depth of the stall may vary as shown in Table 5.

Table 5. Minimum Parking Stall Dimensions 

	Stall Orientation	Stall Width	Stall Depth (Measures Perpendicular to Aisle)	Stall Length	Aisle Width

	60°	8'	18'	16'	18'	N/A

	Perpendicular	8'	16'	16'	24'	24'

e. Use of Compact Vehicle Spaces. The first ten spaces of any project shall be standard sized spaces. In multifamily residential projects, up to thirty percent of the required uncovered parking spaces may be compact spaces (eight feet wide by sixteen feet wide). For nonresidential projects, up to thirty percent of the required parking spaces may be compact spaces. Compact spaces shall be clearly labeled for “compact cars” and grouped together in one or more locations or at regular intervals so that only compact vehicles can easily maneuver into the space.

f. Proper Grading, Surfacing and Maintenance of Parking Lots Required. All grading plans relating to the parking facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer before any work can commence. All off-street parking facilities shall be properly graded and drained so as to dispose of all surface water accumulated within the area of the parking lot. In no instance shall a storm drainage facility be designed to allow the flow of water into abutting property. All parking spaces and maneuvering areas shall be properly surfaced with two inches of asphaltic concrete over a five-inch aggregate base, or comparable material as determined by the city engineer.

g. Vehicle Overhanging Landscaped Area or Walkway Prohibited. The required length of a parking space shall not provide for a vehicle overhanging a landscaped area or walkway.

h. Water Quality Requirement. Post-construction best management practices (BMPs) and water quality mitigation measures such as site design and source control BMPs, including low impact development (LID) techniques, shall be incorporated into all parking and loading facilities projects to minimize impacts from storm water runoff and dry weather flows (see SMC 18.02.070(G)(5)(b)).

5. Driveways and Site Access. Each driveway providing site access from a street, alley, or other public right-of-way shall be designed, constructed, and properly maintained in compliance with the following:

a. Number of Driveways. The number and placement of driveways shall be limited as follows; provided, that second driveways or additional curb cuts may be approved by the traffic advisory committee. A multifamily or nonresidential development project on a parcel of two acres or less shall be limited to a maximum of two driveways, unless the city engineer determines that more than two driveways are required to accommodate the traffic for the project. Whenever a property has access to more than one street, access shall be generally limited to the lowest volume street where the impact of a new access will be minimized.

b. Distance from Street Corners and Spacing. Each driveway shall be separated from the nearest street intersection as follows, except where the city engineer allows less separation: a minimum of one hundred fifty feet from the nearest intersection, as measured from the centerline of the driveway to the centerline of the nearest travel lane of the intersecting street. For parcels with frontages less than one hundred fifty feet, the minimum distance shall be one hundred feet. Where two or more driveways serve the same or adjacent multifamily or nonresidential development, the centerline of the driveways shall be separated by a minimum of fifty feet. The city engineer may approve exceptions to this standard.

c. Driveway Dimensions. A driveway for a multifamily or nonresidential development shall have a minimum paved width of thirteen feet for a one-way driveway and twenty-six feet for a two-way driveway. The maximum driveway width shall be thirty-five feet, exclusive of any area provided for a median divider. Where unpaved driveways are otherwise allowed by this title or the review authority, each driveway shall be paved with concrete or asphalt for a minimum length of twenty feet from the public right-of-way.

d. Clearance. The nearest edge of a driveway curb cut shall be at least three feet from the nearest property line, the centerline of a fire hydrant, light standard, traffic signal, utility pole or other similar facility. Street trees shall be a minimum of ten feet from the driveway access, measured at the trunk. A driveway shall have an overhead clearance of fourteen feet in height except within a parking structure, which may be reduced to seven feet, six inches.

6. Loading Space Requirements. Off-street loading spaces shall be provided, unless determined by the city that the operating, shipping, and delivery characteristics of the use do not require the number or type of loading spaces required. Nonresidential uses shall provide off-street loading spaces as follows:

	Floor area under 15,000 square feet	None required; except grocery store greater than 5,000 square feet requires 1 space

	Floor area 15,000 to 50,000 square feet	1 space

	Floor area over 50,000 square feet	2 spaces

a. Loading Space Types. Loading docks instead of loading spaces shall be required at big box stores, home improvement centers, and large shopping centers. Loading spaces, rather than loading docks, shall be required for convenience stores, offices, restaurants, small shopping centers where truck deliveries occur on a regular basis, but where a loading dock is not necessary.

b. Development Standards. Loading spaces shall be a minimum of twelve feet in width, forty feet in length, with fourteen feet of vertical clearance. Loading areas shall have lighting capable of providing adequate illumination for security and safety.

c. Location. Loading spaces shall be as near as possible to the main structure and limited to the rear two-thirds of the parcel, if feasible; situated to ensure that the loading facility is screened from adjacent streets; situated to ensure that loading and unloading takes place on site and in no case faces a public street, or is located within a required front or street side setback, adjacent public right-of-way, or other on-site traffic circulation areas; and situated to ensure that all vehicular maneuvers occur on site. The loading areas shall allow vehicles to enter from and exit to a public street in a forward motion only. Loading areas shall avoid adverse impacts upon neighboring residential properties. The review authority may restrict times allowed for loading and deliveries for loading spaces that are located closer than one hundred feet to a residential zone.

d. Screening. Loading areas shall be screened from abutting parcels and streets with a combination of dense landscaping and solid masonry walls with a minimum height of six feet.

e. Striping. Loading spaces shall be striped, and identified for “loading only.” The striping and “loading only” notations shall be continuously maintained in a clear and visible manner in compliance with the approved plans.

f. Surfacing. All loading areas shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete pavement, or comparable material as determined by the city engineer.

B. Landscaping Requirements.

1. General Landscaping Requirements. For purposes of this section, “landscaping” shall mean the placement of materials (e.g., berms, decorative fences and walls, flowers, grass, groundcover, hedges, shrubs and trees) within a designated area.

a. To conserve water, the installation of native and/or drought-tolerant landscape materials is strongly encouraged.

b. All parts of a site not devoted to decks, patios, structures, and similar improvements, driveway and/or parking improvements, lighting, sidewalks, signs, and solid waste/recyclable materials collection and storage shall be landscaped in compliance with this section and this title.

c. Within coastal strand vegetation areas, undeveloped dune areas, steep dunes, and steep slope areas (those in excess of twenty-five percent slope) shall be landscaped with native, noninvasive plant species to maximize opportunities for native habitat restoration.

d. A master restoration plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional for any undeveloped private dune areas, as well as all public dune areas situated within the coastal zone.

e. Where feasible and practical, landscaping shall be designed to address post-construction water quality site design and low impact design (LID) requirements (e.g., as biofiltration, vegetated swales, or similar) and to minimize adverse impacts from storm water runoff and dry weather flows.

2. Landscaping of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be landscaped as follows:

a. Amount of Landscaping. Multifamily, commercial, and industrial uses shall provide landscaping within each outdoor parking area at a minimum ratio of ten percent of the gross area of the parking lot. The board of architectural review may grant an exception for small, infill parking lots where compliance with this standard is not feasible without significantly reducing the number of parking spaces. Trees not less than five feet in height and fifteen-gallon container in size shall be planted throughout the parcel and along any street frontage. At a minimum, one shade tree shall be provided for every five parking spaces.

b. Landscape Materials. Landscaping shall be provided throughout the parking lot as a combination of groundcover, shrubs, and trees.

c. Location of Landscaping. Landscaping shall be evenly dispersed throughout the parking area, as follows:

i. Orchard-style planting (the placement of trees in uniformly spaced rows) is encouraged for larger parking areas;

ii. Parking lots with more than fifty spaces shall provide a concentration of landscape elements at primary entrances, including, at a minimum, specimen trees, flowering plants, enhanced paving, and project identification;

iii. Landscaping shall be located so that pedestrians are not required to cross unpaved landscaped areas to reach building entrances from parked cars. This shall be achieved through proper orientation of the landscaped fingers and islands, and by providing pedestrian access through landscaped areas that would otherwise block direct pedestrian routes.

d. Perimeter Landscaping. All surface parking areas shall be screened from streets and adjoining properties, and the open areas between the property line and the public street right-of-way shall be landscaped. A parking area for a nonresidential use adjoining a public street shall be designed to provide a landscaped planting strip between the street right-of-way and parking area equal in depth to the setback required by the applicable zone or ten feet, whichever is greater; except that the required width of the landscape strip may be reduced by the board of architectural review (BAR) upon recommendation from the city’s park supervisor, where it has been determined that the overall site area is insufficient to accommodate allowable structures and required parking along with a landscape strip of the otherwise required width.

i. The landscaping shall be designed and maintained to screen cars from view from the street to a minimum height of thirty-six inches, but shall not exceed any applicable height limit for landscaping within a setback. Screening materials may include a combination of plant materials, earth berms, raised planters, solid decorative masonry walls, or other screening devices which meet the intent of this requirement.

ii. Shade trees shall be provided at a minimum rate of one for every twenty-five linear feet of landscaped area, or other spacing as determined by the review authority to be appropriate to the site and surrounding development.

iii. Parking areas for nonresidential uses shall provide a perimeter landscape strip at least eight feet wide (inside dimension) where the parking area adjoins a side or rear property line; except that the required width of the landscape strip may be reduced by the review authority where it determines that overall site area is insufficient to accommodate allowable structures and required parking along with a landscape strip of the otherwise required width. The requirement for a landscape strip may be satisfied by a setback or buffer area that is otherwise required. Trees shall be provided at the rate of one for each twenty-five linear feet of landscaped area, or other spacing as determined by the review authority to be appropriate to the site and surrounding development.

iv. Adjacent to Structures. When a parking area is located adjacent to a nonresidential structure, a minimum eight-foot-wide (inside dimension) landscape strip shall be provided adjacent to the structure, exclusive of any building entries, or areas immediately adjacent to the wall of the structure that serve as pedestrian accessways. The required width of the landscape strip may be reduced by the review authority where it determines that overall site area is insufficient to accommodate allowable structures and required parking along with a landscape strip of the otherwise required width.

v. Adjacent to Residential Use. A parking area for a nonresidential use adjoining a residential use shall provide a landscaped buffer setback with a minimum ten-foot width between the parking area and the common property line bordering the residential use.

(A) A solid decorative masonry wall or fence, except for approved pedestrian access, and landscape buffer shall be provided along the property line to address land use compatibility issues (e.g., light/glare and nuisance noise) as determined by the review authority.

(B) Trees shall be provided at the rate of one for each twenty-five linear feet of landscaped area, or other spacing as determined by the review authority to be appropriate to the site and surrounding development

e. Groundwater Recharge. The design of parking lot landscape areas shall consider and may, where appropriate, be required to include provisions for the on-site detention of storm water runoff, pollutant cleansing and groundwater recharge.

3. Landscaping Standards.

a. Minimum Dimensions. Each area of landscaping shall have a minimum interior width of eight feet within the residential and commercial zones, and five feet in the industrial zones. These dimensions may be reduced where the review authority determines they are infeasible because of limited site area. Wherever this title requires a landscaped area of a specified width, the width shall be measured within any curb or wall bordering the landscaping area.

b. Protective Curbing. Required landscaping shall be protected with a minimum six-inch high concrete curb, except adjacent to bicycle paths, or where otherwise deemed unnecessary by the zoning administrator.

c. Safety Requirements. Landscape materials shall be located so that at maturity they do not:

i. Interfere with safe sight distances for bicycle, pedestrian or vehicular traffic;

ii. Conflict with overhead lights, utility lines or walkway lights; or

iii. Block bicycle or pedestrian ways.

d. Lawns. Lawns shall be limited to fifty percent of the total landscaped area on the site and only where the applicant provides calculations approved by the zoning administrator that demonstrate that the irrigation requirements will not exceed standard low water usage. No lawns shall be allowed:

i. In any area of ten feet or less in width; or

ii. On any slope exceeding ten percent (twenty-five percent, where other project water-saving techniques compensate for the increased runoff). A level buffer zone of eighteen inches shall be provided between bermed lawn areas and any hardscape (e.g., any street, walkway or similar feature); or

iii. A nonrecreational land use.

e. Water Features. Decorative water features (e.g., fountains, ponds, waterfalls) shall have recirculating water systems.

4. Visual Obstructions.

a. When placed within or immediately adjacent to a dedicated public right-of-way, no landscape material shall be allowed to obstruct clear vision or to create a potential traffic hazard.

b. Landscaping that is primarily intended or designed for fencing purposes shall not be allowed to exceed four feet in height within a required front setback area.

c. On the street sides of a corner parcel, no landscaping shall be allowed to exceed four feet in height above the top of the existing or proposed street curb within the traffic safety visibility area.

5. Trees.

a. In order to achieve a more immediate effect, all trees planted on the street sides of a newly developed parcel shall be transplanted from five-gallon or larger size containers. A tree proposed to replace an existing mature specimen tree shall be transplanted from a minimum twenty-four-gallon size container.

b. All trees shall be adequately supported when planted. The supports shall be maintained until the trees are capable of withstanding the force of wind on their own.

c. Where existing trees are required to be preserved, all new development shall be designed in a manner which respects the current drip lines.

6. Solar Access. When trees are incorporated into an approved landscaping plan, they shall be planted in a manner which maximizes the provision of sunlight to nearby windows and/or solar collectors situated on site or on an adjoining property.

7. Irrigation System Requirements. All landscaped areas except those approved for maintenance with intentionally nonirrigated native plants shall include an automatic irrigation system.

a. Water-efficient systems (e.g., bubbler-type, drip, mini-spray, or similar system) shall be used unless infeasible.

[IMAGE]


ii. Sign Structure. Supporting bracing or framework that is determined by the zoning administrator to be clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be included in the calculation of total sign area.

iii. Multi-Faced Signs. The area of a double-faced sign shall be calculated for one face only, unless the two faces are not back to back, parallel, and/or are separated by more than twelve inches.

iv. Three-Dimensional Objects. The area of a sign consisting of one or more three-dimensional objects (e.g., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statue-like trademarks) shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane.


[IMAGE]


b. Sign Height.

i. Measurement. The height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the lowest point of the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of either the:

(A) Existing grade before construction; or

(B) Newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any berming, filling, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
[IMAGE]


ii. Maximum Height for Freestanding Signs. A freestanding sign shall not exceed a height of six feet above normal grade in the residential zones. Freestanding signs shall be limited to fourteen feet above normal grade in all other zones.

iii. Maximum Height for Signs on Structures. The top of a sign mounted on a structure shall not extend higher than the lesser of:

(A) The window sills of the second floor;

(B) The top of the wall to which the sign is attached, in the case of a one-story structure; or

(C) Twenty feet above normal grade.

c. Sign Location Requirements. Each sign shall be located in compliance with the following requirements, and all other applicable provisions of this chapter:

i. Each sign shall be located on the same site as the subject of the sign, except as otherwise allowed by this chapter.

ii. No sign shall project over public property, or the public right-of-way, except where the city has granted an encroachment permit in addition to a sign permit.

iii. No sign shall be placed so as to interfere with the operation of a door, fire escape or window.

d. Signs Placed within the Public Right-of-Way.

i. No sign shall be allowed within the public right-of-way except for the following:

(A) Public signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental agency to convey public information, identify public property, post legal notices, or direct or regulate pedestrian or vehicular traffic;

(B) Bus stop signs installed by a public transit company;

(C) Informational signs of a public utility regarding its lines, pipes, poles or other facilities; or

(D) Emergency warning signs erected by a governmental agency, a public utility company, or a contractor doing authorized work within the public right-of-way.

ii. Any sign installed or placed within the public right-of-way other than in compliance with this section shall be forfeited to the public and be subject to confiscation.

iii. In addition, the city shall have the right to recover from the owner, or person placing the sign, the full costs for sign removal and disposal.

iv. A sign permit shall not be required for city signs placed within the public right-of-way.

e. Design Criteria. The following design criteria shall be used in reviewing the design of individual signs. Substantial conformance with each of the following design criteria shall be required before a sign permit or building permit can be approved:

i. Color. Colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious with one another and relate to the dominant colors of the other structures on the site. Contrasting colors may be utilized if the overall effect of the sign is still compatible with the structure colors and prevailing colors in the surrounding neighborhood (where a theme can be identified).

ii. Design and Construction. The intent of this subsection is to ensure public safety, achieve signs of careful construction, neat and readable copy, and durability, to reduce maintenance costs and to prevent dilapidation. Each sign shall be designed by a professional (e.g., architect, building designer, landscape architect, interior designer, or another whose principal business is the design, manufacture, or sale of signs), or others who are capable of producing professional results. Each permanent sign should be constructed by persons whose principal business is building construction or a related trade including sign manufacturing and installation businesses, or others capable of producing professional results.

iii. Materials and Structure. Sign materials (including framing and supports) shall be representative of the type and scale of materials used on the primary on-site structure and on other on-site signs. Materials for permanent signs shall be durable and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance. The size of the structural members (e.g., braces, columns, and crossbeams) shall be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting. In general, fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports. The use of individual letters incorporated into the structure’s design is encouraged, rather than signs with background and framing other than the structure’s wall(s).

iv. Street Address. The review authority may require that a sign include the site street address, where it determines that public safety and emergency vehicle response would be more effectively served than if the street address were displayed solely on one or more structures on the site.

f. Copy Design Guidelines. The city does not regulate the message content (copy) of signs; however, the following are principles of copy design and layout that can enhance the readability and attractiveness of signs. Copy design and layout consistent with these principles is encouraged.

i. Sign copy should relate only to the name and/or nature of the business or commercial center.

ii. Permanent signs that advertise continuous sales, special prices, or include phone numbers, etc. should be avoided.

iii. Information should be conveyed briefly or by logo, symbol, or other graphic manner. The intent should be to increase the readability of the sign and thereby enhance the identity of the business.

iv. The area of letters or symbols should not exceed forty percent of the background area in commercial and industrial zones or sixty percent in residential zones.

v. Freestanding signs should contain the street address of the parcel or the range of addresses for a multi-tenant center.

g. Sign Lighting. Sign lighting shall be designed to minimize light and glare on surrounding rights-of-way and properties in compliance with subsection C of this section, outdoor lighting, and the following:

i. External light sources shall be directed and shielded so they do not produce glare on any object other than the sign, and/or off the site of the sign;

ii. The light illuminating a sign shall not be of a brightness or intensity that will interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of residential properties;

iii. Sign illumination shall not blink, flash, flutter, or change light brightness, color or intensity;

iv. Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as to be confused or construed as traffic control devices;

v. Neither the direct nor reflected light from primary light sources shall create hazards for pedestrians or operators of motor vehicles;

vi. Reflective-type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed fifteen watts shall not be used so as to expose the face of the bulb or lamp to a public right-of-way or adjacent property;

vii. Light sources shall utilize hard-wired fluorescent or compact fluorescent lamps, or other lighting technology that is of equal or greater energy efficiency;

viii. Permanently installed illuminated panels, visible tubing, and strings of lights outlining all or a portion of a structure, other than lighting that is primarily for indirectly illuminating architectural features, signs, or landscaping, shall be deemed “signs” subject to this chapter and shall be counted as part of the allowed sign area. Each line of tubing or lights shall be deemed to have a minimum width of at least six inches for the purpose of calculating area.

h. Maintenance of Signs.

i. Each sign and supporting hardware, including temporary signs, shall be maintained in good repair and functioning properly at all times.

ii. Any repair to a sign shall be of equal or better in quality of materials and design as the original sign.

iii. A sign that is not properly maintained and is dilapidated shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated.

iv. When an existing sign is removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and other supports that are no longer required shall be removed.

v. Unpainted areas shall be painted to match the adjacent portion of the structure or the sign support structure.

3. Sign Requirements for Commercial Land Uses. The sign requirements shall be applicable to the CMX/WBUVSP, CVSC, CCH and CCRG land uses within the coastal zone. Allowed signs and sign standards for these land uses are summarized in Table 6, in addition to the provisions of requirements for all signs above and standards for specific sign types below, as applicable.

Special development standards provide for the establishment of certain regulations and/or considerations in areas where, by reason of location, topography, existing development conditions, or other circumstances, development impacts may be greater or circumstances may necessitate additional site-specific regulation to further the purposes of this title.

B. Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area (ESHA).

1. Biological Report Requirements.

a. Applications for development of any type, including subdivision, shall include field surveys and impact analysis, by a qualified biologist to precisely determine the locations of habitat areas, including ESHAs, and to recommend siting, design, and related mitigation measures to ensure protection of any sensitive species or habitat areas present.

v. Alternatives and/or mitigation measures for reducing any identified impacts to a less than a significant level.

vi. Mitigation/restoration and monitoring program for any mitigation required.

b. All reports shall be prepared by a qualified biologist, and all field surveys for such biological reports shall be undertaken during times when documented or expected habitat evidence is most likely to be detected (e.g., flowering season, breeding season, etc.).

c. At a minimum, a report shall be prepared for all proposed development that meets one or more of the following criteria:

i. The development is or may potentially be located within an environmentally sensitive habitat area, based on current available resource information or through on-site investigation;

ii. The development is or may potentially be located within one hundred feet of an environmentally sensitive habitat area and/or has the potential to significantly degrade such area; or

iii. There is disagreement between city staff and the applicant as to whether the proposed development meets one of the above criteria.

d. The report shall be required, submitted and accepted by the planning department prior to the application being determined complete. The manner (electronic versus hard copy, number of copies, etc.) in which said report is to be submitted shall be determined by the planning department.

e. Report preparation shall be solely at applicant expense.

2. Development within or Adjacent to an ESHA.

a. Development within ESHA. ESHAs shall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values, and only uses dependent on those resources shall be allowed within those areas.

b. Development Adjacent to ESHA. Development in areas adjacent to ESHAs shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade those areas, and shall be compatible with the protection of those habitat areas.

c. Buffers. Development shall be set back from all ESHAs, a sufficient distance to ensure the biological integrity of the resource. A minimum buffer of fifty feet, as measured from the edge of the identified ESHA, shall be required, although larger buffers are encouraged. Smaller setbacks or buffers may be allowed if it can be demonstrated that (i) a fifty-foot buffer is not possible due to site constraints or would render the site unusable for designated use, (ii) public recreational facilities, such as trail and/or nature observation platforms or piers, are provided within the buffer zone, and (iii) in the opinion of a professional biologist, and to the satisfaction of the city, a smaller buffer would provide sufficient protection of the resource. Under no circumstances shall the buffer be reduced to less than twenty-five feet. If the buffer/setback is adjusted downward, additional mitigation measures developed in consultation with the Department of Fish and Game shall be implemented.

C. Marine Resource Areas.

1. Designation of Marine Resource Areas. For any proposed development within the coastal zone, the applicant and/or city shall identify whether it is located within, adjacent to, or has watershed connection to Laguna Grande, Roberts Lake, and/or Monterey Bay, each of which is identified in the LUP as a marine resource area.

Any modifications of or discharging into jurisdictional features may be subject to Sections 401 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, and thus may require additional consultation with state and/or federal agencies, and may also require special permits. Mitigation of wetland/riparian impacts is required as a condition of any 404 permits and may include on-site preservation, restoration, or enhancement and/or off-site restoration or enhancement. For LCP-allowable modifications or discharges, and upon consultation with the appropriate state and federal resource agencies, the applicant is required to submit a plan for the preservation and/or reestablishment of equivalent (size and biological value) areas of riparian and marsh vegetation (if appropriate) including implementation and maintenance.

4. Diking, Filling, Dredging of Marine Resource Areas. Diking, filling, or dredging activities may be allowed only if such activities are:

This chapter implements the applicable provisions in the land use plan to protect and enhance the quality of coastal waters, by providing standards for the review and authorization of new development and redevelopment consistent with the requirements of the California Coastal Act and Resolution No. R3-2012-0025 of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, central coast region.

2. Applicability. The provisions of this chapter apply to the review of all coastal permit applications (CAPs and CDPs). All proposed development shall be evaluated for potential adverse impacts to coastal water quality as well as for opportunities to enhance coastal water quality of the city’s lakes and watercourses and the Monterey Bay.

3. Application Submittal Requirements. Applicants shall be required to submit to the city a preliminary post-construction runoff plan and a construction pollution prevention plan simultaneously with the submittal of a coastal permit application within the coastal zone. The preliminary construction and post-construction plans shall address impacts of storm water and dry weather runoff, and specify best management practices (BMPs) that will be developed to minimize the discharge of pollutants and minimize increases in storm water runoff volume and flow rates from the development during and after construction. Applicants shall be required to submit a final post-construction runoff plan for approval by the city prior to issuance of a building permit.

4. Construction Pollution Prevention Plan. A construction pollution prevention plan (also referred to as an erosion control and sediment plan) (CPPP or ECSP) is required for all development that involves on-site construction, to address the control of construction-phase erosion, sedimentation, and polluted runoff. This plan shall specify the temporary BMPs that will be implemented to minimize erosion and sedimentation during construction, and minimize pollution of runoff by construction chemicals and materials. The construction pollution prevention plan/erosion control and sediment plan shall demonstrate that:

a. During construction, development shall minimize site runoff and erosion through the use of temporary BMPs (including, but not limited to, soil stabilization measures), and shall minimize the discharge of sediment and other potential pollutants resulting from construction activities (e.g., chemicals, vehicle fluids, asphalt and cement compounds, debris, and trash).

b. Clearing and grading shall be limited to the minimal footprint necessary and for the shortest time necessary to avoid increased erosion and sedimentation. Soil compaction due to construction activities shall be minimized in order to retain the infiltration capacity of the soil.

c. Construction shall minimize the disturbance of plant cover (including trees, native vegetation, and root structures), which is important for preventing erosion and sedimentation.

d. Development shall implement soil stabilization BMPs, including but not limited to revegetation, on graded or disturbed areas as soon as feasible.

e. Grading operations shall not be conducted during the rainy season (from October 1st to April 30th), except in response to an emergency. The city may grant a postponement of the rainy season grading prohibition for a project for a specified length of time, based on a determination that conditions at the project site are suitable for wet weather grading without the potential for significant water quality impacts, the likelihood of significant precipitation is low during the period of postponement, adequate erosion and sedimentation control measures will be maintained during all grading operations, and all grading activities will stop if rain commences.

f. Construction Pollution Prevention Plan Content. The final CPPP/ECSP shall be submitted with the final construction drawings for all projects. The plan shall include, at a minimum, a narrative report and map that describe all temporary erosion, sedimentation, and polluted runoff control measures to be implemented during construction, including:

i. Proposed methods for minimizing clearing and grading, soil compaction, and disturbance of natural vegetation.

ii. Erosion and sedimentation controls to be implemented.

iii. BMPs to be implemented for staging, storage, and disposal of excavated materials.

iv. Revegetation, hydromulching, or other strategy plans for protecting graded or disturbed areas which require disturbance for extended periods of time.

v. Other soil stabilization BMPs to be implemented.

vi. A schedule for installation and removal of temporary erosion control BMPs, and identification of temporary BMPs that will be converted to permanent post-construction BMPs.

vii. Proposed methods to prevent the discharge of sediment and other pollutants resulting from construction activities (e.g., paints, solvents, vehicle fluids, asphalt and cement compounds, and debris) into runoff.

viii. Design specifications for any required structural construction-phase BMPs, such as sedimentation basins.

ix. Pollution prevention BMPs to be implemented for staging, storage, and disposal of construction chemicals and materials.

x. A description of pollution prevention/good housekeeping practices to be used on the construction site, including, but not limited to, maintaining an inventory of chemicals and other materials to be used on site, having a cleanup plan and cleanup materials readily available for spills and leaks, and ensuring that employees are trained in pollution prevention and spill cleanup practices.

g. As applicable, obtain a construction general permit with waste discharge identification number, WDID, from the state Water Quality Control Board. Prepare and submit storm water pollution prevention plan to city for review.

5. Post-Construction Water Quality Protection. Post-construction best management practices (BMPs) and water quality mitigation measures such as site design and source control BMPs, including low impact development (LID) techniques, shall be incorporated into new development and redevelopment projects to minimize impacts from storm water runoff and dry weather flows. Treatment control BMPs should be reserved for developments with an anticipated pollutant load, such as a gas station, car wash, or auto repair station, and for development greater than five thousand square feet.

Post-construction BMP considerations include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. BMP Design Standards. Where BMPs are required, BMPs shall be selected that have been shown to be effective in reducing the pollutants typically generated by the proposed land use. The design of BMPs shall be guided by the current editions of the California Stormwater Quality Association (CASQA) Stormwater BMP Handbooks, or an equivalent BMP manual that describes the type, location, size, implementation, and maintenance of BMPs suitable to address the pollutants generated by the development, and specific to a climate similar to that of the central coast of California.

b. Low Impact Development Strategies.

i. Site and design developments to minimize the impact of development on the infiltration, purification, detention, and retention functions of natural drainage systems that exist on and adjacent to the site.

ii. Minimize the creation of impervious surfaces (including pavement, sidewalks, driveways, patios, parking areas, streets, and rooftops), especially directly connected impervious areas.

iii. Maintain, or enhance where appropriate and feasible, on-site infiltration of runoff, in order to preserve natural hydrologic conditions, recharge groundwater, attenuate runoff flow, retain dry weather runoff on site, and minimize transport of pollutants, for up to the eighty-fifth percentile twenty-four-hour storm event.

iv. Divert runoff from impervious surfaces so that it flows into permeable areas in order to maintain, or enhance where appropriate and feasible, on-site infiltration capacity. Sites that have high pollutant loading, such as commercial or industrial sites, may require pretreatment BMPs prior to infiltration.

v. Where pavement is required, use permeable pavement (e.g., interlocking paver blocks, porous asphalt, permeable concrete, decomposed granite, or reinforced grass or gravel), where feasible, to reduce runoff. Permeable pavements shall be designed so that runoff infiltrates into the underlying soil or engineered substrate, filtering pollutants, buffering runoff generation, and recharging groundwater, and development shall provide for the ongoing maintenance required to assure permeability.

c. Site Design BMPs.

i. Minimize creation of impervious surfaces.

ii. Provide adequate setbacks and buffers from coastal waters, including Laguna Grande, Roberts Lake and Monterey Bay.

iii. Divert runoff from impervious surfaces (e.g., rooftops, driveways, sidewalks, and patios) to permeable areas.

v. Install permeable pavement where pavement is required.

vi. Disconnect directly connected impervious areas.

vii. Improve and maintain soil quality.

viii. Install rain barrels or cisterns to capture roof runoff.

ix. Plant and preserve trees and other plants.

6. Post-Construction Runoff Plan. A post-construction runoff plan (PCRP) is required for all development projects to specify BMPs that will be implemented to minimize discharge of pollutants and minimize increases in storm water runoff volume and flow rate from the development after construction is completed.

At the time of submittal of a permit application, an applicant shall be required to submit to the city a preliminary PCRP, and prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall submit a final PCRP for approval by the city.

The preliminary and final post-construction runoff plans shall include:

a. A map showing site drainage patterns (pre- and post-project) and a narrative describing proposed changes to drainage; and the locations of any BMPs to be implemented and maintained on site after construction has been completed.

b. A description of the development site, including explanations of the site conditions (e.g., soil type, aspect and orientation), details of any potential pollutants originating from the post-construction use of the development, and any major changes to the grade and drainage capacity on the site due to the development.

c. A description of proposed site design and source control BMPs to minimize post-construction polluted runoff and impacts to water quality, including:

i. Measures to convey runoff from impervious surfaces into permeable areas of the property in a nonerosive manner.

ii. Measures to maximize the ability of native substrates to retain and infiltrate runoff (including directing rooftop runoff to permeable areas rather than to the storm drain system).

iii. Measures to maximize the area of on-site permeable surfaces, and to limit directly-connected impervious areas, in order to increase infiltration of runoff.

iv. Measures to discharge runoff in a manner that avoids potential adverse impacts.

v. Measures to keep pollutants from coming into contact with storm water runoff.

vi. A schedule for the installation or implementation of all BMPs.

vii. An operations and maintenance plan for any required BMPs that need ongoing maintenance to protect water quality for the life of the project.

viii. A description of the relationship of the proposed development to the nearest surrounding coastal waters and wetlands, such as distance, elevation, and hydrologic connectivity.

7. Commercial and Industrial Developments. The following subset of development require additional post-construction BMPs to address the predictable pollutants from those uses:

a. Loading dock areas that have the potential for material spills to be quickly transported to the storm water conveyance system shall be covered, and shall be designed to minimize run-on and runoff of storm water. Direct connections to storm drains from depressed loading docks (e.g., truck wells) are prohibited.

b. Development associated with fueling, repairing, storing, or washing automobiles or service vehicles requires special site design and source control BMPs to prevent anticipated pollutants from vehicles mixing with storm water or surface water runoff and entering the storm drain system or coming in contact with coastal waters.

c. Any exposed maintenance or industrial activity areas and areas where such activities may not be exposed but that result in storm water contact with associated pollutants shall include designated areas for maintenance and servicing of equipment, and all such activities shall be confined to these areas. All runoff within such designated areas and within any food service washdown areas shall be contained. The perimeter of these areas shall be constructed so as to completely contain runoff (i.e., curbs, berms, shower drains, etc.), and the contained area shall be plumbed to the sanitary sewer. The sewer connection in these areas shall be equipped with shutoff valves and these areas shall be covered (e.g., roofs or awnings) in such a manner as to minimize discharge of high volume storm water flows to the sanitary sewer.

d. Site design and source control BMPs must also be included which prevent run-on of surface water or storm water from entering these service areas, where the water may come in contact with vehicle pollutants and then leave the site as polluted runoff.

e. In addition to the above requirements, the following BMPs shall be incorporated into the design of the following types of development:

i. Vehicle service facilities (e.g., gasoline stations, car washes, and automotive repair facilities) shall cover fuel dispensing and vehicle service areas with an overhanging roof structure or canopy. This cover must not drain onto the fuel dispensing area or service area, and all downspouts must be routed to prevent drainage across the fueling area.

ii. Fuel dispensing areas shall:

(A) Be paved with Portland cement concrete (or an equivalent smooth, impervious surface; the use of asphalt concrete shall be prohibited).

(B) Have a two percent to four percent slope to prevent ponding.

(C) Be separated from the rest of the site by a grade break that prevents run-on/runoff of storm water.

(D) Have a drainage system that captures all leaks and spills and connects to a sump for collection and proper disposal.

iii. Areas designated for washing/steam cleaning of vehicles and equipment must:

(A) Be equipped with a clarifier or other pretreatment facility.

(B) Be properly connected to a sanitary sewer to prevent metals, oil and grease, solvents, and phosphates from entering the storm drain system or coastal waters.

iv. Repair/maintenance bays shall:

(A) Be indoors, covered, or designed in such a way that prevents oil and grease, solvents, car battery acid, coolant, and gasoline from contacting storm water run on/runoff.

(B) Have a drainage system that captures all wash water, leaks, and spills and connects to a sump for collection and disposal.

v. Direct connection of vehicle service facilities to the storm drain system is prohibited.

vi. An industrial waste discharge permit must be obtained when required.

f. Parking lots over five thousand square feet in area shall be designed to minimize impervious surfaces, and runoff from the parking lot shall be treated and/or infiltrated before it reaches the storm drain system so that heavy metals, oil and grease, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons deposited on parking lot surfaces will not be transported to surface waters.

The design of landscaped areas for parking lots shall consider and may, where appropriate, be required to include provisions for the on-site infiltration, detention, and/or retention of storm water runoff, which reduces and slows runoff, and provides pollutant cleansing and groundwater recharge. Where landscaped areas are designed for infiltration detention, and/or retention of storm water runoff from the parking lots, recessed landscaped areas (below the surface of the pavement) shall be required. Curb cuts shall be placed in curbs bordering landscaped areas, or curbs shall not be installed, to allow storm water runoff to flow from the parking lot into landscaped areas. All surface parking areas shall be provided a permeable buffer between the parking area and adjoining streets and properties.

Accumulation of particulates contaminated by oil, grease, or other water-insoluble hydrocarbons from vehicle leaks shall be removed from heavily used parking lots (e.g., fast food outlets, lots with twenty-five or more parking spaces, sports event parking lots, hotels, shopping malls, grocery stores, and discount warehouse stores) by dry vacuuming or equivalent techniques. Filter treatment systems, particularly for hydrocarbon removal BMPs, shall be adequately maintained for the life of the development.

g. Restaurants shall be designed to minimize runoff of oil and grease, solvents, phosphates, and suspended solids to the storm drain system. Equipment washing/steam cleaning areas must be equipped with a grease trap, and properly connected to a sanitary sewer. If the wash area is to be located outdoors, it must be covered, paved, have secondary containment, and be connected to the sanitary sewer. Dumpster areas must have secondary containment.

h. Outdoor storage areas for materials with the potential to pollute storm water (e.g., toxic compounds, oil and grease, heavy metals, nutrients, suspended solids, and other pollutants) must: (1) be protected by secondary containment structures such as berms, dikes, or curbs, (2) be sufficiently impervious to contain leaks and spills, and (3) have a roof or awning to minimize collection of storm water within the secondary containment area.

i. Commercial, industrial, and multi-unit residential trash storage areas must: (1) have drainage from adjoining roofs and pavement diverted around the area, (2) be covered and/or screened or walled to prevent off-site transport of trash, and (3) be inspected and cleaned regularly.

8. Development Greater than Five Thousand Square Feet. All new development and redevelopment greater than five thousand square feet in site coverage or involving impervious surfaces of five thousand square feet or more (two thousand five hundred square feet or more if within two hundred feet of a lake or ocean shoreline, or otherwise determined to be development with water quality impacts by the city) shall be subject to the following additional requirements to protect coastal waters:

a. Hydromodification shall be controlled by maintaining certain characteristics of the predevelopment hydrograph, as described herein. Where changes in storm water runoff hydrology (i.e., volume and flow rate) may result in increased potential for stream bank erosion, downstream flooding, or adverse habitat impacts, runoff control measures (e.g., storm water infiltration or detention) shall be required in order to retain on site the storm water quality design volume (SWQDv), for the city of Seaside this defined as the runoff volume from the ninety-fifth percentile, twenty-four-hour storm event.

b. If the combination of site design and source control BMPs proposed will not be sufficient to minimize the runoff pollutants of concern, then a treatment control BMP (or suite of BMPs) shall be required, that is designed and sized appropriately to remove the pollutants of concern for the city of Seaside:

i. Volume-based BMPs should be sized to treat the eighty-fifth percentile twenty-four-hour storm event; and

ii. Flow-through BMPs should be sized to treat the eighty-fifth percentile one-hour storm event (with an appropriate safety factor of two or greater).

c. A water quality and hydrology plan (WQHP) shall be required. In the application and initial planning process the applicant shall be required to submit for approval a preliminary WQHP and prior to issuance of a building permit the applicant shall submit a final WQHP for approval by the department of public works that has been certified by a California registered civil engineer, professional geologist, certified engineering geologist, or certified hydrogeologist qualified to complete this work. The water quality and hydrology plan shall contain the following:

i. A certified post-construction runoff plan for the project (subsection (G)(5) of this section, post-construction runoff plan) shall be included, either as an appendix or integrated into the WQHP.

ii. An estimate of the changes to the anticipated pollutant loads and changes in runoff flows, resulting from the proposed development; with supporting calculations.

iii. A description of any runoff control measures and/or treatment control BMPs that will be implemented to minimize post-construction hydrologic and/or water quality impacts; including a description of how LID or other alternative methods could not address the impacts.

iv. Where runoff control measures are required, provide predevelopment and post-development storm water runoff hydrographs demonstrating that the storm water quality design volume (SWQDv) will be retained on site.

v. If a treatment control BMP is required in the city of Seaside to remove a pollutant of concern, then a description of how the treatment control BMP (or suite of BMPs) will be sized to treat the eighty-fifth percentile twenty-four-hour storm event for volume-based BMPs, or the eighty-fifth percentile one-hour storm event (with an appropriate safety factor of two or greater) for flow-through BMPs shall be included in the WQHP.

vi. A long-term plan for the maintenance of all BMPs, as appropriate, to ensure that they operate as designed for the life of the development.

9. Definitions. See Chapter 18.04 SMC, Definitions.

H. Public Access and Recreation.

1. New development shall be sited and designed to maximize public recreational access opportunities. Proposed development shall enhance and shall not impair the public’s ability to access and enjoy points and passages to public access features, including those identified in Figure 2-8, Public Access Points and Passages, of the LUP.

2. New development shall plan for and provide public access to and along the shoreline and the city’s lake and wetland areas in a manner that maximizes public trail and access connectivity and utility.

3. Maximize public pedestrian access opportunities and public access improvements (e.g., trails, benches, etc.), within the coastal zone. Areas within the West Broadway Urban Village specific plan are also subject to the applicable development standards and design guidelines included in Appendix C of the LCP. All public paths shall be designed at a minimum width of ten feet.

I. Additional Standards for Coastal Zone Subareas.

1. The city of Seaside recognizes that there are unique subareas within the city’s coastal zone that require special considerations for environmental issues such as visual resources, public access and recreation, and dune management. As such, the city’s coastal zone is further divided into four coastal zone subareas: Laguna Grande subarea, Roberts Lake subarea, Beach subarea, and Del Monte subarea as illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b. In addition to the development standards that apply throughout the city’s coastal zone, the following development standards identified below shall also apply within the specified subareas:

2. Additional Standards for Laguna Grande Subarea.

a. Development within one hundred feet of Laguna Grande, including the channel area, shall be limited to one-story, not exceeding a maximum of twenty feet, except for design/architectural features (e.g., cupolas, domes, tower elements, etc.) that are otherwise consistent with LCP policies and that shall not exceed a maximum height of thirty feet.

b. To protect views and environmental function of the Laguna Grande channel area, proposed development should avoid placing structures in close proximity to the channel. However, such improvements as parking lots and recreational amenities (such as formalized viewing areas, landscaping, interpretive or directional signage, and improved trailways) shall not be prohibited if in compliance with other provisions of this title.

c. Maximize public access and access improvements, consistent with habitat protection, from the public right-of-way to and along public access trails. All public paths shall be designed at a minimum width of ten feet.

d. Development shall not interfere with the maintenance/continuance of the developed pedestrian walkway/bikeway. The walkway/bikeway shall be maintained at a minimum width of ten feet.

f. Development between one hundred feet and five hundred feet of Laguna Grande, including the channel area, shall be limited to a maximum of five stories and sixty feet in height and shall be oriented parallel to the channel (perpendicular to Del Monte) in a manner designed to maximize through Highway 1 views. Upper floors shall be set back from lower floors in a manner designed to step away from Laguna Grande, including the channel, and building facades shall include articulation (including breaking up the design with some areas of indent, varied rooflines, offsets, and projections that provide shadow patterns) designed to avoid a boxy look and to integrate the design into its surroundings in a manner protective of public views and the natural surroundings.

3. Additional Standards for the Roberts Lake Subarea.

a. Development within one hundred feet of Roberts Lake shall be limited to one story, and fifteen feet in height.

b. Maximize public access and associated trail improvements along lands adjoining the Roberts Lake subarea shoreline. All public paths shall be designed at a minimum width of ten feet. Where passing through or near the wildlife habitat area to be established in Roberts Lake, this access is to be designed so as to protect the habitat area.

18.03.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish the coastal permit process for the review of all development within the city of Seaside’s coastal zone to ensure that development projects are consistent with the intent and requirements of the Coastal Act and the city’s local coastal land use plan (LUP), and to ensure timely review and action on proposed projects. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.020 Coastal permit requirements.

A. Coastal Permit Required. Except as otherwise provided in SMC 18.03.030, Exemptions, persons wishing to undertake any development in the coastal zone shall obtain a coastal permit, either a coastal administrative permit (CAP) or a coastal development permit (CDP), in accordance with the provisions of this title.

B. Coastal Administrative Permit (CAP). Applications for development associated with a use that is listed as a principally permitted use in the respective category within the applicable zoning district and that: (1) as proposed is consistent with the LCP; (2) requires no discretionary approval other than a coastal permit; and (3) has no adverse effect either individually or cumulatively on coastal resources, including public access, shall obtain a coastal administrative permit (CAP).

C. Coastal Development Permit (CDP). Applications for development associated with a use that is listed as a conditional allowable use in the respective category within the applicable zoning district or any other development not meeting the criteria for a CAP shall obtain a coastal development permit (CDP).

D. Additional Permits. The review of a CDP application may be combined with and/or processed concurrently with the review of any other discretionary permit application required by other city ordinances. When an application for a development is proposed, the city shall not grant any such discretionary approval for development that conflicts with any policy or standard of this title. No such discretionary approval shall be effective until or unless a CDP is approved that authorizes the subject development.

E. Legal Development and Permitting Processes. Development that legally occurred prior to the effective date of the Coastal Act of 1976 or its predecessor, the Coastal Zone Conservation Act of 1972, if applicable, is considered lawfully established development. Improvements, repair, modification, or additions subject to such existing development may be subject to a CAP/CDP or other city permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The CAP/CDP shall only be approved if the proposed development is consistent with the policies and standards of the city’s LCP.

F. Illegal Development and Permitting Processes. Development that occurred after the effective date of the Coastal Act of 1976 or its predecessor, the Coastal Zone Conservation Act of 1972, if applicable, and that was not authorized in a CAP/CDP or otherwise authorized under the Coastal Act, is not lawfully established or lawfully authorized development. No improvements, repair, modification, or additions to such existing development may be approved, unless the city also approves a CAP/CDP that authorizes the existing development. The CAP/CDP shall only be approved if the existing and proposed development, with any applicable conditions of approval, is consistent with the policies and standards of the city’s LCP. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.030 Exemptions.

Certain minor projects, as defined in accordance with the California Coastal Act of 1976 and the California Code of Regulations, are exempted from the requirements to obtain a coastal permit. Upon Coastal Commission notification, the city shall update this section to remain consistent with legislative amendments to the Coastal Act and the California Code of Regulations, Title 14, California Coastal Commission. Any conflicts between this section and the current Coastal Act and California Code of Regulations shall be resolved in favor of the current Coastal Act and California Code of Regulations. Development listed below is exempt from the requirement to obtain city approval of a CAP/CDP. Requirements for any other permits are unaffected by this section.

A. Projects with Coastal Commission Approval. Projects authorized by a valid coastal permit or equivalent authorization issued by the Coastal Commission or in areas where the Coastal Commission retains original permit jurisdiction. A person undertaking development included in a public works plan or long-range development plan approved by the Coastal Commission is not required to obtain a CAP/CDP from the city. Other city permits may be required.

B. Replacement after Natural Disaster. The replacement of any structure, other than a public works facility, destroyed by a natural disaster is exempt; provided, that the replacement structure conforms to applicable existing zoning requirements, will be for the same uses as the destroyed structure, does not exceed either the floor area, height, or bulk of the destroyed structure by more than ten percent, and will be sited in the same location on the affected property as the destroyed structure. Public Resources Code Section 30610(g)(1).

C. Improvements to existing single-family residences, including fixtures and structures directly attached to the residence and structures normally associated with single-family residence uses such as garage, and landscaping, but not including guest houses and self-contained residential units.

e. Any repair or maintenance to facilities or structures or work located in an environmentally sensitive habitat area, or any dune area, within fifty feet of the edge of a coastal bluff or environmentally sensitive habitat area, or within twenty feet of coastal waters or streams.

2. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to those activities specifically described as exempt from coastal permit requirements in the document entitled Repair, Maintenance and Utility Hookups, adopted by the Coastal Commission on September 5, 1978. These projects shall be exempt from obtaining a CAP/CDP unless a proposed activity will have a risk of substantial adverse impact on public access, environmentally sensitive habitat area, wetlands, or public views to the ocean.

3. Unless destroyed by natural disaster, the replacement of fifty percent or more of a single- family residence, seawall, revetment, bluff retaining wall, breakwater, groin, or any other structure is not repair and maintenance but instead constitutes a replacement structure requiring a coastal development permit.

F. Land Division. Land division brought about in connection with the purchase of such land by a public agency for public recreational uses.

G. Utility Connections. The installation, testing, and placement in service or the replacement of any necessary utility connection between an existing service facility and any development which has been granted a valid coastal permit that accounted for such connection; provided, however, that the city may require conditions to mitigate any adverse impacts on coastal resources including scenic resources. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.040 Approval authority.

The planning commission shall be the approval authority to hear and decide applications for coastal development permits (CDPs). The zoning administrator is the approval authority to consider coastal administrative permits (CAPs). (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.050 Coastal permit process.

A. Application. A prospective applicant or their respective agent must pay the appropriate fees and submit sufficient information for a planner to determine which process they must follow for their request as outlined in SMC 18.03.110. An application for a CAP/CDP shall be reviewed in conjunction with whatever other permits are required for the project in the underlying zone. Where a CAP/CDP is combined with another permit, the approving body for the CAP/CDP shall be the same as that for the permit required for the underlying zoning district.

B. Hearings.

1. Coastal Development Permits. All coastal development permits require a public hearing. Before a decision on a CDP, the city shall provide notice of a public hearing by the planning commission.

2. Coastal Administrative Permits.

a. Initial Notice. A notice of the proposed development shall be provided to all persons who would otherwise be required to be notified of a public hearing (see below) as well as any other persons known to be interested in receiving notice. The notice shall state that the zoning administrator will decide whether to approve or disapprove the CAP application on a date specified in the notice and that a public hearing will be held only if requested in writing by any interested person before the specified date for the decision. The notice shall include a statement that failure by a person to request a public hearing may result in the loss of that person’s ability to appeal to the Coastal Commission any action taken by the city on the CAP application.

b. Hearing. If no request for public hearing is received by the city before the specified date for the decision, then the zoning administrator may take action without a public hearing. When a public hearing is requested, notice of the hearing shall be provided in accordance for then provisions for notice (below) and the zoning administrator shall conduct the public hearing before a decision on the application.

3. Noticing. For all CAP applications for which a public hearing is requested and for all CDP applications, the following notice provisions shall apply. Not less than ten calendar days prior to consideration of the CAP/CDP, the city shall give notice of such consideration by mailing, postage prepaid, a notice of such consideration to all owners and legal residents of property within three hundred feet of the exterior boundaries of the property to be occupied by the use/development for which the permit was applied, all persons who have requested, in writing, notices relating to coastal permits or the application being considered, all parties known to be interested in the application (including parties who have testified or submitted comments on the proposed development), interested public agencies, and the Coastal Commission.

C. Findings Required. All decisions on CAP/CDPs shall be accompanied by written findings. An application for a CDP may be approved or conditionally approved only if the decision maker makes all of the findings listed below:

1. The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use or structure applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use, or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvement in the neighborhood, or to the general welfare of the city.

2. The subject property is in compliance with all rules and regulations pertaining to zoning uses, subdivision, and any other applicable provisions of this title, and any zoning violations have been resolved, including any abatement costs have been paid.

3. The proposed project conforms to the public access and public recreation policies of the Coastal Act.

4. The proposed development is in conformance with plans, policies, and requirements of the certified local coastal program land use plan and complies with all regulations of the certified implementation program. Specific findings shall be made with respect to the following:

a. The proposed development protects vegetation, natural habitats, and natural resources consistent with the LUP.

b. The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed development are consistent with any applicable design plans and/or area plans incorporated into the LUP.

Modification and resubmittal of project plans, drawings and specifications, preparation of additional plans, or recordation of documents may be required to ensure conformance with the LCP. When modifications and resubmittal of plans, additional plans, or recorded documents are required, issuance of the permit shall be deferred for a sufficient period of time to allow the city to determine whether the modified project, the additional plans, or the recorded documents comply with the conditions of approval of the permit.

E. Notice of Final Action. For coastal administrative permits approved without benefit of a public hearing, all persons receiving notice pursuant to subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section or requesting such notice shall be notified in writing of the issuance of a coastal administrative permit. For all CAPs/CDPs, a final action notice shall be prepared that describes the approved development (including all supporting findings, conditions, and materials (approved project plans, applicable technical reports, etc.)) and the process by which it was approved, and information on appeal procedures, including local appeals as well as appeals to the Coastal Commission. Within seven calendar days of the final local action on a CAP/CDP, the city shall provide such notice of its action by first class mail to the Coastal Commission and to any persons who specifically requested notice of such final action by submitting a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the resource management services department – planning division. The city’s action on a CAP/CDP shall not be considered final until all rights of appeal have been exhausted. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.060 Determination of permit requirement.

A. The zoning administrator shall determine, at the written request of any member of the public, whether or not any development proposed in the coastal zone is exempt from a coastal development permit pursuant to this title.

B. Any person wishing such determination shall submit to the resource management services department all statements, plans, and elevations deemed necessary by the resource management services department to assess the development.

C. After review, the zoning administrator shall notify the applicant and the California Coastal Commission in writing:

1. That the development is exempt and state the category of exemption; or

2. That a coastal development permit is required and, if so, whether it is appealable or not.

The procedure described in this section shall be considered an administrative determination and is appealable pursuant to SMC 18.03.120. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.070 Revocation.

Where one or more of the conditions of a coastal permit have not been, or are not being, complied with, or when a coastal permit was granted on the basis of false material information, the zoning administrator (for a CAP) or the planning commission (for a CDP) may revoke or modify the coastal permit following public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be the same as would be required for a new CDP. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.080 Expiration of coastal permits.

Unless the permit states otherwise, a CAP/CDP shall expire two years from its date of approval if the development has not commenced during that time. The approving authority may grant an extension of one year for good cause. Extensions shall be requested in writing by the applicant or authorized agent prior to expiration of the two-year period. Such extensions of CAPs/CDPs shall be considered amendments for purpose of notice and appeal to the Coastal Commission. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)


18.03.090 Coastal permit amendments.

Upon application by the permittee, a CAP/CDP may be amended. Application for an amendment shall be accomplished in the same manner specified by this title for the initial application of the CAP/CDP. All sections of this title dealing with the specific type of CAP/CDP shall apply to permit amendments. (Ord. 1006 § 4 (Att. 1), 2013)

If the city manager or his/her designee determines that grounds for suspension or revocation of the cannabis development/operating agreement exist pursuant to Chapter 19.09 SMC, the city manager or his/her designee shall issue a written notice of intention to revoke or suspend the development/operating agreement, along with such information as required herein. The notice of intention shall be served on the property owner, as reported on the latest equalized assessment roll, and shall also be served on permittees operating a commercial cannabis activity on the property. The notice of intention shall be served by either personal delivery or by certified U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. The notice of intention shall identify the property owner, permittees, name of business and location of the property, the intended action to be taken, the grounds for the action, the action necessary to abate the violation, the time limit for abatement compliance, and the right to challenge this intended action to a hearing officer. The notice of intention shall notify the owner and permittees of the opportunity to request a hearing before a hearing officer to present evidence as to why the development/operating agreement should not be suspended or revoked and shall notify them of the ten-day deadline to submit a written request for a hearing. 

The owner and permittees shall have ten calendar days from the service of the notice of intention to submit a written request for a hearing before a hearing officer selected by the city manager. Failure to submit the written request for a hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to challenge the suspension or revocation of the development/operating agreement and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. If the hearing is not timely requested, the city manager or his/her designee may suspend or revoke the use permit in accordance with the notice of intention. 

Upon receipt of a timely written request for a hearing, the city manager or his/her designee shall appoint a hearing officer and set a date for a hearing to be held within sixty days of receipt of the request, unless an immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare necessitates an earlier hearing date. Notice of the hearing, including the time, date, and location of the hearing, shall be served on the owner and permittees, such service to be accomplished by either personal delivery or by certified U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. (Ord. 1047 § 2, 2018; Ord. 1043, 2017)

In any proceeding before a hearing officer, oral testimony offered as evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation, and the hearing officer, his/her clerk, or other designee shall have the power to administer oaths and affirmations and to certify to official acts. 

All parties to the hearing shall have the opportunity to testify, introduce exhibits, call and examine witnesses, and cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues. The matter shall be informal and not proceed according to the rules of evidence. Determination of the true facts shall be the guiding principle in the hearing of the matter.

Within thirty calendar days after the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision, including a statement of the basis for the decision and findings of facts. The hearing officer’s written decision shall constitute the final administrative decision of the city of Seaside. 

In the event a civil action is initiated to obtain enforcement of the decision of the hearing officer, and judgment is entered to enforce the decision, the person against whom the order of enforcement has been entered shall be liable to pay the city’s total costs of enforcement, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of the hearing. 

If neither owner nor any permittee nor their authorized representatives appear at the noticed hearing, such failure to appear shall constitute an abandonment of the hearing request and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. (Ord. 1047 § 2, 2018; Ord. 1043, 2017)
