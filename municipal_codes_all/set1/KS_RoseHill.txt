(Ord. 617; Code 2017)

1-212.          Code of ethics.

(a)   Declaration of Policy - The proper operation of our government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of those goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city.

(b)   Responsibilities of Public Office - Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this State and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state, and city and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the long term public interest must be their primary concern. Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be above reproach.

(c)   Dedicated Service - All officials and employees of the city should be responsive to the political objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointive officials and employees should adhere to the rule of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority. Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by officially recognized confidentiality of their work.

(d)   Fair and Equal Treatment –

(1)   Interest in Appointments. Canvassing of members of the city council, directly or indirectly, in order to obtain preferential consideration in connection with any appointment to the municipal service shall disqualify the candidate for appointment except with reference to positions filled by appointment by the city council.

(2)   Use of Public Property - No official or employee shall request or permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official business.

(3)   Obligations to Citizens - No official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen.

(e)   Conflict of Interest - No elected or appointive city official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her duties in the public interest or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties. Personal as distinguished from financial interest includes an interest arising from blood or marriage relationships or close business or political association.

Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated below for the guidance of officials and employees:

(1)   Incompatible Employment - No elected or appointive city official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties.

(2)   Disclosure of Confidential Information - No elected or appointive city official or employee, shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of the city. Nor shall he or she use such information to advance the financial or other private interest of himself, herself or others.

(3)   Gifts and Favors. No elected or appointive city official or employee shall accept any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan, thing or promise, from any person, firm, or corporation which to his or her knowledge is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the city; nor shall any such official or employee (a) accept any gift, favor or thing of value that may tend to influence him or her in the discharge of his or her duties or (b) grant in the discharge of his or her duties any improper favor, service, or thing of value. The prohibition against gifts or favors shall not apply to: (a) an occasional nonpecuniary gift, of only nominal value or (b) an award publicly presented in recognition of public service or (c) any gift which would have been offered or given to him or her if not an official or employee.

(4)   Representing Private Interest Before City Agencies or Courts - No elected or appointive city official or employee whose salary is paid in whole or in part by the city shall appear in behalf of private interest before any agency of this city. He or she shall not represent private interests in any action or proceeding against the interest of the city in any litigation to which the city is a party.

The notice shall also state, in prominent language, that failure by the owner to request a hearing within five days after receipt of the notice may act as a waiver of his or her right to a hearing and that this may result in the placing of a lien against the motor vehicle for the towing and storage charges without further notice to the owner; and that the motor vehicle be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after 15 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. The owner of the impounded motor vehicle shall sign the notice as an acknowledgment that he or she has received a copy of the notice and a copy of the notice shall be provided to the owner.

The police department shall use reasonable diligence in determining the title owner, or if from a non-title state, the registered owner, of the vehicle, and shall inquire by mail of the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in this state, as to whether there are any lienholders of record.

(Code 1989)

14-306.       Release of motor vehicle from impoundment

(a)   Generally Unless the vehicle is impounded pursuant to section 14-302(b) herein, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment upon requesting such release and presenting proof of ownership satisfactory to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored.  If the custodian is satisfied that the person making the request is the owner or his or her authorized agent, he or she shall release the motor vehicle to the owner or his or her agent. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the owner of the impounded motor vehicle or his or her agent from paying any towing and storage charges that may be assessed against the motor vehicle, but neither the police department nor the custodian of the storage space may require payment of any towing or storage charges as a condition precedent to such release.  At the same time as the owner or his or her agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle, and if such request is made with 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, the police department shall provide him or her an opportunity to make a request for a hearing on the propriety of the impoundment and on the amount and his or her liability for the towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; provided, that if the owner or his or her agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle more than 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, no hearing may be requested on the impoundment or on the towing and storage charges and the owner shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the impoundment and to the amount of and his or her liability for the towing and storage charges.

(b)   Security for Payment of Charges. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a title certificate issued by the Kansas Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the owner or his or her agent may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment without the payment of any towing or storage charges or the deposit of any security for the payment thereof. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a foreign title instrument, or if the jurisdiction in which title is recorded is not evidenced from the document establishing ownership, the owner or his or her agent, before the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored authorizes release of the motor vehicle form impoundment, shall deposit with the custodian cash in the amount of the towing and storage charges to the date of the request. If the owner or his or her agent refuses to provide the cash deposit, the custodian shall not authorize release of the impounded motor vehicle but if the request is timely made, a date shall be set for the hearing on the impoundment and charges.

(Code 1989)

14-307.       Hearing.

If the owner of an impounded motor vehicle or his or her agent timely requests the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment and a hearing on the impoundment and charges, as provided in section 14-306, a date shall be set, not more than five days after the date of request, for the hearing.  The city attorney shall provide a hearing examiner to conduct the hearings required by this section. At the hearing, the owner, his or her agent, or his or her attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to present, by oral testimony or documentary evidence, his or her objections to (a) the impoundment of the motor vehicle and (b) (1) the amount of the towing and storage charges and (2) his or her liability for the payment thereof. If the owner or his or her agent requested the hearing more than five days but not more than 40 days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment, the owner, his or her agent or his or her attorney shall be required at the hearing, as a condition precedent to the. presentation of any objections by the owner, to show good cause for the delay in making the request more than five days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment; if good cause cannot be shown, the hearing officer shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding stated in subsection (b) below; otherwise, the hearing examiner shall proceed to hear the owner’s objections. At the conclusion of the hearing on the owner’s objections, the hearing examiner shall render his or her decision if the hearing examiner:

(a)   Finds that the impoundment was improper, he or she shall:-

(1)   Find that the owner is not liable for any towing or storage charges occasioned by the impoundment and

(2)   Determine whether and to what extent the city shall be the expense of the towing and storage charges; or

(b)   Finds that the impoundment was proper, he or she shall establish:

(1)   The amount of the towing and storage charges to be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle and

(2)   The extent of the liability of the owner for payment of the towing and storage charges so established. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, and a copy of the decision shall be furnished to the owner of the impounded motor vehicle, to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored and to the city attorney.

In the event that the impoundment was pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102(b), the owner or occupant of the real property upon which the abandoned vehicle was located shall not be assessed the costs of towing and storage of the vehicle. Further, nothing within this article shall be construed to modify or effect the validity of the possessory lien of the person removing such vehicle from the real property established by K.S.A. 8-1102(b).

(Code 1989)

14-308.       Charges constitute a lien.

The towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment of a motor vehicle pursuant to section 14-302 shall be and constitute a lien upon the impounded motor vehicle, except as provided in this section. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 14-307 that the impoundment was improper and if he or she determines that the city shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the lien created by this section shall be discharged. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 14-306 that the impoundment was proper but that the towing and storage charges should be in an amount less than the amount of the lien, the lien created by this section shall be discharged to the extent that it exceeds the amount established by the hearing examiner. The holder of a lien created by this section may perfect such lien in any manner provided by law, but he or she may not retain possession of the motor vehicle when it has been released pursuant to section 14-306(a). In the event that the impounded motor vehicle is released from impoundment and the owner or his or her agent has provided security for payment of charges as required by section 14-306(b), the lien created by this section shall also be a lien against the security so provided, subject to being wholly or partially discharged as provided in this section. 

(Code 1989)

14-309.       Satisfaction of lien; notice of public sale.

The holder of a lien against a motor vehicle created by section 14-308, to the extent that such lien has not been discharged as provided in section 14-308 or otherwise satisfied, may enforce such lien in any manner provided by law after 60 days from the date the motor vehicle is impounded by the police department.   If the owner of the motor vehicle or his or her agent has provided security for the payment of the lien as provided in section 14-306(b), the lien shall first be satisfied out of the security so provided and, if any portion of the lien remains unsatisfied and undischarged, may then be enforced in any manner provided by law. If the motor vehicle against which the lien is created pursuant to section 14-308 is still under impoundment 60 days from the date it is impounded by the police department and the owner has not requested release of the motor vehicle from impoundment nor paid the towing and storage charges that are the basis for the lien, the motor vehicle shall be sold at public sale to the highest and best bidder for cash to satisfy the lien. Notice of the sale shall be given in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1102.  Publication required by K.S.A. 8-1102, may be made before the termination of the 60 day period for a sale thereafter. 

(Code 1989)

14-310.       Redemption.

If the city is to conduct the sale:

(a)   Any holder of a recorded lien or retained title on a motor vehicle to be sold by the city under the provisions of section 14-309 may claim and take possession  thereof,  upon payment of accrued charges and estimated  costs of publication of the notice of sale to the police department and the deposit with the police department of sufficient assurance by surety bond or otherwise, approved by the city attorney, that the motor vehicle will’ be forthcoming for public sale thereof or upon claim of the rightful owner prior to the sale.  The police department shall, within three days, make a report to the city treasurer and deliver the charges and costs so paid to the city treasurer, taking a receipt therefor and filing it, together with a duplicate copy of the report to the city treasurer, with the records in his or her office. The funds shall be held in a trust account until final disposition of the motor vehicle. Not less than five days before the date for sale of the motor vehicle, the police department shall notify the lienholder or retained titleholder of the time and place for the sale, and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall deliver such motor vehicle to the police department at or before 12:00 noon of the day before the sale. At the sale the amount paid shall be credited on the bid of the lienholder or retained titleholder. If the lienholder or retained titleholder is the successful bidder for the motor vehicle, the police department shall report this fact to the city treasurer and then the funds previously paid by the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be relieved of the trust previously impressed and become the same as other funds received by the city for storage and costs of impounded motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is sold for a higher bid to any person other than the lienholder or retained titleholder, the police department shall report this fad to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him out of the trust account.

(b)   And if the rightful owner of the motor vehicle claims the same before the sale by payment of the accrued charges, the police department shall immediately notify the lienholder or retained titleholder in possession of the motor vehicle and he or she shall return the same to the police department within 12 hours.  The police department shall report this redemption by the rightful owner to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him or her out of the trust account.

(Code 1989)

14-311.       Sale proceeds.

The proceeds of a public sale held pursuant to section 14-308 whether such sale was conducted by the city or by any other person, after payment of the towing and storage charges and costs and expenses incident to the sale, shall be deposited with the city treasurer, if the owner of the motor vehicle is absent from the sale, for credit to the trust account. The funds deposited in the trust account pursuant to this section shall remain in the account subject to the order of the person legally entitled thereto, but if no claim is made for these funds within a period of one year after the sale, the funds shall become the property of the city, be released from the trust account and be paid into the general fund as miscellaneous revenues. 

(Code 1989)

14-312.       Statutory procedures.

(1)   A fund designated for the specific purpose of defraying operation and maintenance costs (excluding replacement) of the treatment facility (operation and maintenance).

(2)   A fund designated for the specific purpose of ensuring replacement needs over the useful life of the treatment facility (replacement fund). Deposits in replacement fund shall be made annually from the operation, maintenance and replacement revenue in the amount of $5,000.

(c)   Fiscal year-end balances in the operation and maintenance fund and the replacement fund shall be carried over to the same fund in the subsequent fiscal year, and shall be used for no other purposes than those designated for these funds. Moneys which have been transferred from other sources to meet temporary shortages in the operation, maintenance and replacement fund shall be returned to their respective funds upon appropriate adjustment of the user charge rates for operation, maintenance and replacement. The user charge rates shall be adjusted such that the transferred moneys will be returned to their respective funds within the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the moneys were borrowed.

Each contributor shall also pay an additional pro-rated amount for each gallon above 1,000 gallons at the rate of $3.36 per 1,000 gallons of water (or wastewater) as determined in subsection (e) and (f).

(h)   Commercial contributors shall be determined by sales tax and/or those other than residential or not for profit organizations. For those contributors who contribute wastewater, the strength of which is greater than normal domestic sewage, a surcharge in addition to the normal user charge will be collected.  The surcharge for operation and maintenance including replacement will be determined by the city on an individual basis.

(i)    Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the city’s treatment facility, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance, or replacement of the treatment facility, shall pay for such increases costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the responsible plant operating personnel and approved by the city council.

(j)    The user charge rates established in this article apply to all users, regardless of their location, of the city’s treatment facility, and may be revised once annually as allowed in subsection (m).

(k)   The city will review the user charge system by the end of April each year and revise user charge rates as necessary to ensure that the system generates adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation and maintenance, including replacement, and that the system continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation and maintenance, including replacement costs, among users and user classes.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CITY OF ROSE HILL, KANSAS:

SECTION 1. That in consideration of the benefits to be derived by the City of Rose Hill, Kansas (“City”), and its inhabitants, there is hereby granted to Kansas Gas Service, a Division of ONE Gas, Inc. (“Company”), said Company operating a system for the sale, transmission and distribution of natural gas in the State of Kansas, a non-exclusive franchise for a period of twenty (20) years from the effective date of this Ordinance, to construct, maintain, extend and operate its pipelines and ancillary equipment for the provision and transportation of natural gas (“Facilities”) along, across, upon or under any Public Right-of-Way for the purpose of selling and distributing natural gas for all purposes to the City, and its inhabitants, and through said City and beyond the limits thereof; to obtain said natural gas from any source available; and to do all things necessary or proper to carry on said business. For purposes of this Ordinance, “Public Right-of-Way” means only the area of real property in which the City or the public has a dedicated or acquired easement or right-of-way interest in the real property. Public Right-of-Way shall include the area on, below or above the present and future streets, alleys, utility easements, avenues, roads, highways, bridges, parkways or boulevards dedicated or acquired as right-of-way. The term does not include easements obtained by private entities providing utilities services or private easements in platted subdivisions or tracts.

The grant of this franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public Right-of-Way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public Right-of-Way for the purposes and for the period stated in this Ordinance. This Ordinance does not:

(1)   Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, natural gas-related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party without the consent of such party;

(2)   Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public Right-of-Way;

(3)   Excuse the Company from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on property owned or controlled by the City (other than Public Right-of-Way) or a third-party; or

(4)   Excuse the Company from obtaining and being responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC).

The Company shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Ordinance, and the Company shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law.

The Company shall have the right to assign, sell, lease, or otherwise transfer in any manner whatsoever to any third party not affiliated with Company the rights and privileges granted under this Ordinance as hereinafter provided. Any assignment, sale, lease, or other transfer by the Company of the franchise granted herein to any third party not affiliated with the Company shall be ineffective and void unless:

(1)   The assignment, sale, lease or transfer shall be in writing; and

(2)   The assignee, buyer, lessee or other transferee shall agree in writing to accept and become responsible for full performance of all conditions, covenants, obligations, and liabilities contained in this Ordinance; and

(3)   Such writing shall be submitted to the City Clerk of the City.

This provision shall not apply to the use of any portion of the Company's distribution system for the transportation, distribution or sale to any customer purchasing, receiving and using natural gas outside the municipal corporate limits of the City.

SECTION 2. As further consideration for the granting of this franchise, and in lieu of city occupation, license or permit fees, or revenue taxes, except as expressly provided herein, the Company shall pay to the City during the term of this franchise, a “Franchise Fee” of (i) five percent (5%) of the actual Gross Cash Receipts from the sale of natural gas and transportation services to all consumers within the corporate limits of the City, such payments to be made monthly for the preceding monthly period.

“Gross Cash Receipts” shall not include revenues from certain incidental or miscellaneous charges and accounts including, but not limited to, connection fees, disconnection and reconnection fees, temporary service charges, delayed or late payment charges, collection fees, franchise fees and returned check charges as such terms are used in tariffs or in the natural gas industry.

Payments of the Franchise Fee shall commence with the first cycle of the monthly billing cycle beginning after the passage and adoption of this Ordinance, or as otherwise provided in Section 13 below. Prior to that date, payments shall continue to be calculated and be paid in the manner previously provided in Ordinance No. 369 and amendments thereto.

Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, the Company shall submit to the City a certified statement showing the manner in which the Franchise Fee was calculated. The City shall have the right to examine within the corporate limits of the City, upon written notice to the Company no more often than once per calendar year, all books, papers and records kept by the Company in the ordinary course of business and pertaining to its business carried on by it in or through the City, necessary to verify the correctness of the Franchise Fees paid by Company.

No acceptance by the City of any Franchise Fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any Franchise Fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto.

Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Ordinance, the Company shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Ordinance.

The Franchise Fee required herein shall be in lieu of all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under 12-2001 and 17-1902, and amendments thereto. From and after the date hereof, the permit fees required of the Company by any ordinance presently in effect or hereafter adopted for a permit to excavate in or adjacent to any Public Right-of-Way shall be deemed a part of the compensation paid pursuant to this Section 2 and shall not be separately assessed or collected by the City; in no event, however, shall this provision be interpreted to waive the requirement of notice to the City and the procedural requirements of such ordinance. The Franchise Fee is compensation for use of the Public Right-of-Way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.

SECTION 3. Except as provided herein or as regulated by state or federal law, the use of any Public Right-of-Way under this franchise by the Company shall be subject to all laws, statutes, regulations and/or city policies (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public Right-of-Way or other public property) now or hereafter adopted or promulgated. In addition, the Company shall be subject to all rules, regulations and policies now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to permits, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, and other requirements on the use of the Public Right of Way; provided however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Company to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation or policy proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City and, further provided other than the items enumerated in this Section 3 herein, that such rules, regulations or policies shall not require the payment of additional fees or additional costs for the use of the Public Right-of-Way.

All mains, services, and pipe which shall be laid or installed under this grant shall be so located and laid as not to obstruct or interfere with any water pipes, drains, sewers, or other structures already installed.  The Company shall provide, prior to commencing work, information to the City concerning work to be performed in the streets, avenues, bridges, parking areas, and public places of the City, as the City may from time to time require for purposes of record keeping. The City may require that the information be provided on its standard permit form, but without requiring approval, consent, or fees. In the event of an emergency, the Company shall have the right to commence work without having first providing such form(s).

The Company's use of the Public Right-of-Way shall always be subject and subordinate to the City's use of the Public Right-of-Way for any public purpose. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public Right-of­ Way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory, nor in conflict with state or federal law.

The City reserves the right to lay or permit to be laid cables, electric conduits, water, sewer, gas or other pipelines and to do or permit to be done any underground work deemed necessary and proper by the City, along, across, over or under the Public Rights-of-Way. In permitting such work to be done, the City shall not be liable to the Company for any damage to the Company's Facilities unless the City or its agents or contractors are negligent in causing said damage.

Whenever by reason of establishing a grade or changes in the grade of any street or in the location or manner of construction of any Public Right-of-Way, cables, electric conduits, water, sewer, gas or other underground structures, it shall be deemed necessary  by the City to alter, change, adapt or conform any portion of the Company's Facilities located in the Public Right-of­ Way, such alterations or changes shall be made within a reasonable time by the Company, as ordered in writing by the City, without claim for reimbursement or compensation for damages against the City; provided, however, that this provision is not intended to require the Company to alter, change, adapt or conform any portion of its Facilities without reimbursement or compensation where the right to locate the same, whether by private right-of-way  grant, utility easement or otherwise, was acquired prior to its location in the Public Right-of-Way.

If the city shall require the Company to adapt or conform its Facilities or in any way to alter, relocate or change its property to enable any other person, firm, corporation or entity (whether public or private), other than the City, to use the Public Right-of-Way, the Company shall be reimbursed by the person, firm corporation or entity desiring or occasioning such change for any and all loss, cost or expense occasioned thereby.

Company shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program.

The Company shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the location of its Facilities located within the Public Right-of-Way when requested by the City.  Such location and identification shall be promptly communicated in writing to the City without cost to the City, its employees, agents or authorized contractors. The Company shall designate and maintain an agent, familiar with the Facilities, who is responsible for providing timely information needed by the City for the design and replacement of Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way during and for the design of Public Improvements (as defined in Section 4).

The City shall promptly notify the Company in writing of areas newly annexed into or deannexed from the corporate limits of the City, and the Company shall update its records for the purpose of payment of franchise fees as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving such notice.

After written notice from the City, the Company shall promptly locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any Facilities located in the Public Right-of-Way, if reasonably necessary and requested by the City, for any project planned or undertaken and financed by the City or any governmental entity for construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of public facilities or improvements, or any other purpose of a public nature paid for with public funds (a “Public Project”). Such location removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular Public Project shall be performed by the Company without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors, and shall be specifically subject to rules and regulations of the City pertaining to such. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment is the result of the inaccurate or mistaken information of the Company, the Company shall be responsible for costs associated with such without expense to the City.

It shall be the responsibility of the Company to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way from harm or damage. If the Company fails to accurately locate Facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the City. The Company shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the Company to perform any of its obligations under this Ordinance.

The Company shall be subject to the following fees and costs in connection with its use and occupancy of the Public Right-of-Way: (i) all expense of publishing the ordinance adopting this Ordinance; (ii) in the event that the repairs or replacements set forth under Section 5 have not been timely completed by Company, the City may charge an excavation fee for each street or pavement cut to recover the costs associated with construction and repair activity; (iii) inspection fees to recover all reasonable costs associated with City inspection of the work of the Company in the Public Right-of-Way when the Facilities are of such a scope and magnitude so as to require the City to incur such inspection costs by an outside party; and (iv) the repair and restoration costs associated with repairing and restoring the Public Right-of-Way because of damage caused by the Company, its assigns, contractors, and/or subcontractors in the Public Right-of-Way. Such repair and restoration costs shall be paid in advance to the street superintendent of the City.

SECTION 4. At least 30 days prior to commencing any activities related to the construction, maintenance, or extension of its Facilities along, across, upon or under the Public right of way, the Company shall submit to the City written plans detailing all such activities together with an application for permit and permit fee. In the event of an emergency, Company shall have the right to commence work without having first providing such plans, provided such plans are submitted within 3 business days of commencement of work. The Company shall coordinate the installation, construction, maintenance, and operation of its Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on existing or contemplated public facilities, buildings, or capital improvements, including, without limitation, streets, alleys, sidewalks, sewer, water, drainage, right-of-way improvements, and other Public Projects (collectively, “Public Improvements”), as reasonably determined by the City. The Company's Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities.

SECTION 5. All earth,  materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, Public Improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the Public Right-of-Way that are damaged, displaced, or removed by the Company shall be fully repaired or replaced to their prior condition or to existing municipal standards as are then in existence, and in a manner satisfactory to the duly authorized representatives of the City, within 30 days of completing such activity as is permitted under this Ordinance without cost to the City.

SECTION 6. It is recognized that the natural gas to be delivered hereunder is to be supplied from a pipeline system transporting natural gas from distant sources of supply; and the Company, by its acceptance of this franchise as hereinafter provided, does obligate itself to furnish natural gas in such quantity and for such length of time, limited by the terms hereof, as the said sources and said pipelines are reasonably capable of supplying.

SECTION 7. Company, its successors and assigns, in the construction, maintenance, and operation of its natural gas system, shall use all reasonable and proper precaution to avoid damage or injury to persons and property, and shall indemnify, defend, and hold and save harmless the City from any and all claims, damage, injury, and expense caused by the negligence of said Company, its successors and assigns, or its or their agents or servants.

SECTION 8. The Company shall have the right to make and enforce such reasonable rules and regulations as it may deem necessary for the extension of its Facilities, the sale of its gas, and the prudent conduct of its business, provided that such rules and regulations shall neither be in conflict with the laws of the State of Kansas, with the orders, rules or regulations of the Kansas Corporation Commission or other regulatory authority having jurisdiction, nor with the ordinances and regulations of the City insofar as they are consistent with the jurisdiction of the Kansas Corporation Commission or such other regulatory authority.

SECTION 9. Company shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Company, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Company, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representative, while installing, repairing or maintaining Distribution Facilities in the Right-of-Way or in regards any action or inaction related to Company's obligations set forth in this Franchise.

The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Company and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under the state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and the Company and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or Entity.

SECTION 10.         During the term of this Ordinance, the Company shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the State of Kansas. Should the Company elect to use the services of an affiliated captive insurance company for this purpose, that insurer shall possess a certificate of authority from the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. The Company shall provide not less than the following insurance:

(1)   Workers' compensation as provided for under any worker's compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers' liability limit equal to the amount required by law.

(2)   Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from the Company's operations under this Ordinance.

As an alternative to the above insurance requirements, the Company may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Company has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by the Company, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred.

The Company shall, as a material condition of this Ordinance, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a certificate of insurance or evidence of self-insurance, satisfactory in form and content to the City, evidencing that the above insurance is in force and will not be cancelled or materially changed with respect to areas and entities covered without first giving the City thirty (30) days prior written notice and naming the City as an additional insured.

The Company shall, as a material condition of this Ordinance, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a performance bond, in a form acceptable to the City, in the amount of $50,000. The bond is to ensure the appropriate and timely performance in the construction and maintenance of Facilities located in the Public Right-of-Way and must be issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City in form and substance.

SECTION 11. In case of failure on the part of the Company to comply with any of the provisions of this Ordinance, or if the Company should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Ordinance, the Company shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Ordinance shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Ordinance, it shall first serve a written notice upon Company, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and the Company shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Ordinance. Ifat the end of such sixty (60) day period the City determines that the neglect or failure complained of has not been cured, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Ordinance by an affirmative vote of the governing body present at a public meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Ordinance is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford the Company due process, the Company shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the governing body's consideration, and shall have the right to address the governing body regarding such matter; and further provided, if the nature of the default is such that it cannot be reasonably cured within the above said sixty (60) day period, and the governing body believes the Company has in good faith timely commenced its cure and is diligently pursuing the completion of the same, the Company may, in the City's sole discretion, be given a reasonable additional period of time to complete its cure. Nothing herein shall prevent either party from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the governing body to revoke and terminate this Ordinance, Company shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Ordinance shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless the Company has instituted such an appeal. If the Company does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court's final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of the Company to comply with any of the provisions of this Ordinance or the doing or causing to be done by the Company of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Ordinance shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of the Company is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of the Company or to bona fide legal proceedings.

SECTION 12. In granting its consent hereunder, the City does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, applicable Federal laws or regulations as the same may be amended, its Home Rule powers under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City.

In adopting and passing this Ordinance, neither the City's nor the Company's present or future legal rights, positions, claims, assertions or arguments before any administrative agency or court of law are in any way prejudiced or waived. By the City's adopting and passing this Ordinance and the Company's acceptance hereof as provided in Section 12, neither the City nor the Company waive any rights, but instead expressly reserve any and all rights, remedies, and arguments the City or the Company may have at law or equity, without limitation, to argue, assert, and/or take any position as to the legality or appropriateness of any present or future laws, non­ franchise ordinances and/or rulings.

SECTION 13. This franchise Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, approval by the City, acceptance by the Company, and publication in the official City newspaper. Company shall have sixty (60) days after the final passage and approval of this franchise Ordinance to file with the City Clerk its acceptance in writing of the provisions, terms and conditions of this franchise Ordinance and when so accepted, this franchise Ordinance and acceptance shall constitute a contract between the City and Company and such contract shall be deemed effective on the date Company files its acceptance with the City.

SECTION 14.

SECTION 15. Upon written request of either the City or the Company, this Franchise may be reopened and reviewed after five (5) years from the effective date and every five (5) years from the effective date of this Franchise Ordinance and either the City or the Company may propose amendments to any provision of this Franchise by giving sixty (60) days written notice to the other of the amendment(s) desired. The City and the Company shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a mutually satisfactory amendment(s).

Upon written request of either the City or the Company, the Franchise Ordinance shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time upon any of the following events: (1) Change in federal, state, or local law, regulation, or order, which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or the Company, including but not limited to the scope of the grant to the Company or the compensation to be received by the City; (2) Change in the structure or operation of the natural gas industry which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or the Company, including but not limited to the scope of the grant to the Company or the compensation to be received by the City.

The franchise fee percentage rate set forth in Section 2 shall in no event exceed the percentage rate hereafter approved to calculate any fee paid to the City by any other person or entity for use of the Public Rights-of-Way if such fee is based in any way on the amount of revenues or gross receipts from the transportation, distribution, or sale of natural gas or electric energy, excluding any municipally-owned electric utility, by such other person or entity to customers within the City. Ifat any time after the effective date of this Ordinance the fee or rate required to be paid by another utility distribution company is less than the percentage rate set forth in Section 2, then the percentage rate set forth in Section 2 shall be reduced to equal such lesser percentage rate on the date such lesser percentage rate becomes effective and without any further action by the City.

SECTION 16. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the fees provided for in Section 2 above shall not become effective within any area annexed by the City until the beginning of the monthly billing cycle which begins no more than 60 days after the date that the City provides the Company with a certified copy of the annexation ordinance, proof of publication as required by law and a map of the City detailing the annexed area.

All rights reserved. 1-5
ARTICLE 1. TITLE, PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, JURISDICTION, APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS
100 Title. These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision Regulations of the City of Rose Hill, Kansas", and shall hereinafter be referred to as "these regulations."
101 Purpose. Responsible land subdivision is the initial step in the process of orderly community development. Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is difficult and costly. These regulations are designed and intended to serve the following purposes:
A. To provide for the harmonious development of the City of Rose Hill and for a portion of the surrounding unincorporated area of Butler County;
B. To provide for (1) desirable lot layouts, (2) efficient and orderly location of streets and roadways and the extent and manner in which they shall be improved, and (3) storm water drainage;
C. To provide for adequate water supply, sewage disposal, various utility services and other improvements to protect public health, safety and general welfare;
D. To provide for and secure to the proper governmental agencies the actual construction of all such necessary on-site and off-site public improvements including the reservation or dedication of land for park and recreational purposes;
E. To provide protection from periodic flooding conditions;
F. To reserve or dedicate land for open space to preserve natural areas for watercourses, drainage ways, wetlands, woodland, rugged topography, wildlife habitat, and for water quality and quantity, and to protect land from soil erosion;
G. To avoid water and air pollution and the congestion of population and traffic;
H. To facilitate safety by adequate access for fire fighting equipment and police protection;
I. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning regulations, various construction codes and other City and County regulations which also affect the development of the land;
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2010.
All rights reserved. 1-6
J. To establish administrative procedures necessary to assure a fair and uniform basis for a working relationship with subdividers, utility providers and various governmental agencies, all of whom are contributing to the development of the community; and
K. To realize the goals, policies and planning proposals as contained in the adopted Comprehensive Development Plan.
102 Authority. These regulations are adopted under authority established by K.S.A., 12-741 et seq., as amended, 12-3009 to 12-3012 inclusive, 12-3301 and 12-3302.
103 Subdivision Jurisdiction. These regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the City of Rose Hill as presently exists or are hereinafter established by annexation and within the following land description which is located outside of the City; provided, that such land does not overlap the jurisdiction of any other city or the County's:
That land in Pleasant and Richland townships of Butler County, Kansas, excluding the City of Rose Hill which contains the following areas:
Pleasant Township 28S, R3E: The south 1/2 of Sections 7, 8 and 9; and all of Sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33; and
Richland Township 29S, R3E: All of Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9; plus 300 feet on the east and south boundaries of the above described area which forms a complete rectangle.
All such land is included in the Planning Area for the Comprehensive Development Plan which has been adopted by the Planning Commission and approved by the Governing Body.
104 Applicability. The owner(s) of any land within the jurisdiction of these regulations desiring to vacate rights of way, easements, other public reservations or recorded plats or to:
A. Divide or further divide land into two or more lots or parcels; or
B. Otherwise alter the boundaries of lots or parcels of land; or
C. Establish land for use as streets, alleys or other property intended for public use or for the use of a purchaser or owner(s) of lots or parcels;
shall cause a plat to be made in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, unless exempted under Section 1-105.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2010.
All rights reserved. 1-7
105 Exemptions. Notwithstanding the requirements of Sections 1-103 and 104, these regulations shall not apply in the following instances or transactions:
A. Whenever any lot, parcel or tract of land located within the area governed by these regulations has been legally subdivided, resubdivided or replatted and recorded prior to the effective date of these regulations.
B. For land in the unincorporated area, the division or further division of land into lots or tracts, each of which contains 40 or more acres, and which (1) does not involve any new streets or easements of access as may be determined by the Planning Commission; (2) has land to be used for a dwelling site that is not located in an area subject to flooding as determined by Section 6-104 of these regulations; (3) is to be used for agricultural or single-family residential purposes only; (4) meets the standards set by these regulations for the disposal of sewage and for water supply; and (5) conforms with any applicable zoning regulations. Dedications to widen rights of way to meet standards established in the Comprehensive Plan may be required at such time as application is made for a building permit. The Subdivision Administrator may modify the 40-acre requirement up to 10% for a "shorter quarter". (See Section 2-102 for definition of AGRICULTURE.)
C. A transaction between owners of adjoining land which involves only a change in the boundary between the land owned by such persons and which does not create an additional lot or which does not result in the creation of a substandard lot by either owner according to any applicable zoning regulations or sanitary code.
D. A conveyance or dedication of land or interest therein for use as a street, highway, road or railroad right of way, a drainage easement or public utilities subject to local, state or federal regulation, where no new street or easement of access is created.
E. The layout of burial lots in cemeteries; however, the actual cemetery tract is not exempt.
F. Any lot split in industrially zoned areas divided in accordance with the provisions of Section 9-102 of these regulations.
G. Any transfer by operation of law.
Any request made in writing for a determination as to qualifications for being exempt from these regulations shall be answered by the Subdivision Administrator either in the affirmative or negative within 30 days of filing such a request containing all relevant information.

ARTICLE 2. INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS
100 Rules of Interpretation.
A. Overlapping or Contradictory Regulations. Where the conditions imposed by the provisions of these regulations are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
B. Private Agreements. The provisions of these regulations are not intended to abrogate any lawful and valid easement, deed restriction, covenant or other private agreement of legal relationship; provided, that where the requirements of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such private agreements, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. The City does not have the responsibility to enforce such private agreements.
C. Cumulative Limitations. The provisions of these regulations are cumulative and additional limitations upon all other laws and ordinances heretofore passed or which may be passed hereafter governing any subject matter set forth in the provisions of these regulations.
D. Unlawful Subdivisions. A subdivision of land which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations shall not become or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of these regulations.
E. Vesting of Development Rights. For the purpose of single-family residential developments according to K.S.A. 12-764, as amended, development rights in such land use shall vest upon recording of a final plat of such land after January 1, 1992. If construction of a principal structure is not commenced on such land within five years of recording a final plat before July 01, 2009, the development rights in such land shall expire and, thus, all revisions to zoning or subdivision regulations becoming effective during the period vested shall then apply to such platted land. For such plats recorded on or after July 01, 2009, such construction must take place within 10 years to be vested.

PETITION: A legal instrument which serves as the basis for initiation of a public improvement project. A petition is frequently used during the platting process to guarantee the construction of certain improvements, e.g., street paving, water and sewer lines, drainage, etc. A petition is valid if its signatures are more than 50% either by area within the benefit district or by ownerships. Petitions are also used to initiate the vacation of streets, alleys, easements, other public reservations and plats.

The restrictive covenant may provide for ownership and maintenance to be tied to the ownership of an adjacent lot. Ownership and maintenance is not assigned to an individual, partnership or corporation except in the case of a reserve platted for possible future sale to a public body for a public facility. (See Section 6-102 for Land for Public Facility Sites and Section 6-103 for Land for Open Space.)

ARTICLE 4. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL PLATS
100 Submittal of Sketch Plan. The subdivider may, if deemed desirable, submit a sketch plan at least 20 days prior to their meeting in order to receive the pre-plat comments of the Subdivision Committee and/or the Planning Commission which may prove helpful in designing the preliminary plat. Ten copies of the sketch plan should be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator in a simple format sufficient to convey the location of proposed streets and utilities, the general layout of lots, and to note any particular design situations which could benefit from an early discussion of the problems. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the subdivider with notations marked as to the comments resulting from such a review process. No fee shall be charged for the sketch plan review.
101 Filing of Preliminary Plat. An application shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator at least 30 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission and such number of copies of the preliminary plat as may be determined necessary by the Administrator for proper review by affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations. Such plat shall not be accepted for filing until the fee as provided for in Section 3-109 has been paid by the subdivider to the Clerk. The prelimi-nary plat shall contain the information as set out in Section 5-100 of these regulations.
102 Distribution and Review of Preliminary Plat. After the filing of the preliminary plat, the Subdivision Administrator shall distribute copies to affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations as appropriate. Organizations receiving copies shall have 15 days to review the preliminary plat and to make their comments and recommendations to the Planning Commission. A lack of response in 15 days shall, at the discretion of the Commission, signify approval, unless during this period a written request for an extension of one time only not to exceed 15 days is submitted to the Commission.
103 Action by the Planning Commission on Preliminary Plat. The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plat and consider the comments and recommendations of the organizations to whom the preliminary plat had been submitted for review. If deemed desirable, the Commission may mail notices or copies of agendas to interested parties and conduct a public hearing for the purpose of receiving information supporting or opposing the preliminary plat.
A. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat generally meets the design standards and requirements of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, the applicable zoning regulations and other applicable provisions of the ordinances of the City.
B. If satisfied, the Planning Commission shall approve the preliminary plat with or without conditions by a majority vote of the members present and voting, and so notify the subdivider in writing.

All rights reserved. 4-2
C. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the foregoing conditions, it may suggest modifications so as to satisfy such conditions and in such event:
1. The subdivider may amend the preliminary plat so as to incorporate such modifications and resubmit the plat to the Commission, which shall then grant its approval if such amendments satisfactorily incorporate the suggested modifications; or
2. The subdivider may reject the suggested modifications or, within the time allowed for Commission action, may refrain from taking any action thereon. In either event, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been disapproved and the Commission shall thereupon furnish the subdivider with a written statement setting forth the reasons for disapproval of the preliminary plat.
D. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the conditions of these regulations and that modifications would be too extensive or impractical, it shall disapprove the preliminary plat and immediately notify the subdivider in writing of its action, all within 60 days.
104 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Preliminary Plat. If the Planning Commission fails to approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within 60 days after the date such plat is filed with the Subdivision Administrator or from the date the subdivider has filed the last item of required data, whichever date is later, then such preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been approved, unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation.
105 Effect of Approval of Preliminary Plat.
A. Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the subdivision by the Planning Commission, but shall signify in general the acceptability of the proposed subdivision.
B. Such approval shall be considered permission to submit the final plat accompanied by the information required by Section 5-101R.
C. Such approval shall be effective for no more than 12 months from the date approval was granted, unless, upon application from the subdivider, the Planning Commission grants an extension of time beyond such period. If a final plat for the entire subdivision or a unit thereof has not been filed with the Subdivision Administrator within such period, or any extensions granted thereto, the preliminary plat must be resubmitted to the Commission as if such plat had never been approved, except that no additional fee shall be charged for such resubmittal if there are no substantive changes from the previous preliminary plat approval.

An application for final plat approval, together with a sufficient number of copies as determined by the Subdivision Administrator for proper review, shall be filed with the Administrator at least 20 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Commission and within 12 months after the date that the preliminary plat has been approved. The Administrator shall transmit the final plat to the Commission and to other affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations as desirable for any further recommendations. The final plat shall contain the information as set out in Section 5-101 of these regulations. An application for a replat approval is processed in the same manner as a final plat. (See Section 2-102 for definition of a REPLAT under the heading of PLAT.)
107 Planning Commission Action on the Final Plat. The Planning Commission shall, within 60 days after the first meeting of the Commission following the date that the plat with all required data is filed with the Subdivision Administrator, review and approve the final plat by a majority vote of the members present and voting if:
A.It is substantially the same as the approved preliminary plat; or
B.There has been compliance with all conditions which may have been attached to the approval of the preliminary plat; and
C.It complies with all of the provisions contained in these regulations and of other applicable regulations or laws.
108 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Final Plat.

(See K.S.A. 12-752[b].)
109 Submittal to Governing Body of Final Plat. Before a final plat is recorded, it shall be submitted to the Governing Body for its acceptance of dedications for street rights of way and other public ways, drainage and utility easements, and any land dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the installation of required improvements according to Section 7-104.
110 Governing Body Action on Final Plat. The Governing Body shall either accept or not accept the dedication of any land for public purposes by a majority vote within 30 days after the first meeting of the Governing Body following the date of the submission of the plat to the Clerk. The Governing Body may defer action for an additional 30 days for the purpose of allowing for modifications to comply with the requirements established by the Governing Body. If the Governing Body defers action on the plat or declines to accept the dedications thereto, it shall advise the Planning Commission and the subdivider in writing of the reasons therefor. Acceptance of the dedications on the plat shall be shown over the signature of the Mayor and attested to by the Clerk.

The subdivider shall submit to the Subdivision Administrator such number of copies of the recorded plat as is necessary for record keeping purposes of the City and other affected governmental agencies as well as a DWG or DXF file. (See Section 5-101R1 for title report and Section 10-100C for Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.)
113 Unit Developments. The foregoing provisions of these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, an approved preliminary plat may be submitted for final approval in separate geographic units rather than as a whole, provided the following conditions are met:
A. Each unit of a plat of subdivision shall contain an area of sufficient size based on physical conditions and ability to install improvements economically.
B. The approval of the Planning Commission as to the feasibility of such development, in separate units, including the feasibility of the proposed sequence of development, shall be secured.
C. A final plat of at least one unit shall be filed within 12 months from the date of approval of the preliminary plat, and final plats of all such units shall be filed within five years from the date that the preliminary plat was approved. The Planning Commission on application of the subdivider, may, from time to time, grant extensions of time within which to submit such final plats, provided that each such extension shall be for no more than one year.

A. Authorization. Any other provision of these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, if a proposed plat of subdivision or resubdivision complies with the requirements of Section 4-114B, then the Planning Commission may approve a final plat of such subdivision or resubdivision when neither a sketch plan nor a preliminary plat has been filed by the subdivider and a preliminary plat has not been approved by the Planning Commission.
B. Requirements. In order to qualify for approval in the manner provided in Section 4-114A, a proposed plat of subdivision shall comply with the following requirements:
1. The proposed plat of subdivision shall include not more than 10 acres if a residential plat, nor more than five acres for any other type of plat, unless approved for a larger acreage by the Planning Commission.
2. The proposed plat of subdivision shall create not more than five lots, tracts or parcels of land, unless approved for a larger number by the Planning Commission.
3. No public street or easement of access, e.g., a utility or drainage easement, is sought to be dedicated or is contemplated or projected through (as opposed to adjacent to) the lot, tract or parcel proposed to be subdivided or resubdivided.
4. The proposed plat of subdivision shall be in the form required by Section 5-101 and shall contain all the data, information and certificates required on final plats as well as the supplemental information.
5. Submission of the fees as required by Section 3-109.
C. Procedures.
1. Final plats filed for approval pursuant to Section 4-114 shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator who may submit such plat for review and recommendations to affected and interested governmental agencies and public and private utility providers as deemed desirable. The Administrator may require the subdivider to submit topographic information whenever the property proposed to be subdivided or resubdivided is traversed by or is adjacent to a known watercourse, including intermittent streams or is subject to flooding as defined in Section 6-104.
2. The approval of final plats by the Planning Commission pursuant to Section 4-114 shall be subject to the same procedural provisions of a final plat, except insofar as the said sections require prior approval of, or compliance with, an approved preliminary plat.

ARTICLE 6. DESIGN STANDARDS
100 Scope. All subdivision of land subject to these regulations shall conform to the minimum design standards of this Article according to the classifications of urban and rural type subdivisions as defined in Article 7-100.
101 Comprehensive Development Plan. Subdivisions shall conform with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
102 Land for Public Facility Sites. Public agencies using the Comprehensive Plan as a guide may use the following procedure for acquiring sites for public facilities which does not preclude voluntary dedication and mutual negotiations for land or the use of the condemnation laws of the State: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE.)
A. The subdivider offers to sell to the appropriate public body, agency or authority, lands, sites and locations for parks, recreational areas, schools, fire stations or other public facilities. As soon as the preliminary plat has been received and reviewed, the Planning Commission shall give 45 days notice to the public body, agency or authority that it appears that lands should be considered for public acquisition. If within that 45 days the body receiving notice fails to act or submits a negative report on acquisition, then the subdivision and design thereof shall be treated as if no such request for land had been made.
B.I f the organization receiving notice replies in writing that they desire to acquire land within the subdivision, they shall have an additional 45 days after making such reply to make arrangements for such land acquisition.
C. The time allocated for making the above determination may be extended with the mutual consent of the subdivider and the organization involved.
103 Land for Open Space. The following conditions may be required as part of the approval of any subdivision plat: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE and WETLAND.)
A. That the subdivider provide appropriate dedication of land or easements for the preservation of open space areas within a subdivision. Such open space may be needed to preserve areas containing natural watercourses, drainage ways, areas subject to periodic flooding, wetlands, substantial woodland, rugged topography and wildlife habitat; to maintain water quality and quan-tity; and to protect land from soil erosion. In general, such land is not normally considered as buildable land and should not be developed in order to maintain the quality of the environment.

All rights reserved. 6-2
104 Land Subject to Flooding.
A. Whenever a subdivision of land including platting for manufactured home parks and other developments on one-lot plats is located on flood prone land identified on a Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (F.I.R.M.) prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following requirements shall apply: (See City Zoning Regulations for Floodplain Management Regulations in the City and County Zoning Regulations for floodplain regulations in the unincorporated area.) (See Section 5-101 O for minimum pad elevations.)
1. Show on the preliminary and final plats the boundary lines and elevations for both floodway, if any, and base flood elevation; and
2. Assure that (a) all such subdivisions are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, (b) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, water, gas and electrical systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (c) adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
105 Land Subject to Excessive Erosion by Wind or Water. On land subject to excessive soil movement by the forces of wind and/or water and that may cause environmental health hazards, necessary preventive measures shall be a part of the subdivision plat. Conservation standards applicable to subdivisions shall be adhered to which are used by the Butler County Conservation District.
106 Access. All lots located in any subdivision must contain at least 40 feet of frontage in the City and 30 feet in the unincorporated area for driveways directly connected to an opened public street and not across the land of others. Flag lots are not permitted, unless warranted by an unusual shape of the land or the ownership of property. (See Section 2-102 for definition of FLAG LOT.)
107 Streets-Layout and Design.
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the intent of the Comprehensive Plan, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjoining lands; to topographical conditions; to the run-off of storm water; to public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
B. Where such is not shown on a Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas; or
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
C. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2010.
All rights reserved. 6-3
D. If a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed limited access highway, arterial street or railroad right of way, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with access control provisions along the rear property line and screening, deep lots with rear service alleys or such other design as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
E. Reserve strips controlling access of streets shall be prohibited except where their control is placed with the applicable Governing Body under acceptable conditions.
F. Street right of way requirements for other than arterials shall be determined by the total aggregate needs for the functional components for the particular system being considered. The total aggregates shall be in increments of even feet, even numbers only. The components involved shall be as follows depending upon the urban or rural type of characteristics of the street needed based on land use, traffic and density:
1. Moving or traffic lanes may be variable from nine to 12 feet depending on function, e.g., low density residential, cul-de-sac residential, collector, industrial, etc., and on design speed of the roadway. A moving lane may utilize a portion of the surface of certain types of curb construction.
2. Parking lanes for on-street storage of vehicles shall be at least eight feet in width. For computation purposes, up to two feet for curb or shoulder may be included as part of the parking lane.
3. A curb and gutter shall be considered to require two feet irrespective of construction type.
4. Shoulders for rural type roadways shall be not less than three feet in width.
5. Parking strips for streets shall be at least 14 1/2 feet in width from the back of curb to the right of way line. This area shall be used for the installation of utilities, street signs, street lights, traffic control devices, fire hydrants, sidewalks, driveways, street furniture, street trees from an approved City list and to provide a transition area in grades, if necessary, between the roadway and the property adjacent to the right of way. Ditches and border strips for rural type roads shall be variable in width based on drainage, utility installations and other needs.

All rights reserved. 6-5
When a pattern of widths based on function for a given area has been established, the pattern shall be followed until another system can be established or ties into a collector or arterial system. Access control and acceleration and deceleration lanes may be required to properly handle traffic flow and to protect the carrying capacity of the street.
G. Arterial right of way widths shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan and where not shown thereon shall be between 80-100 feet with 120 feet needed for special storm water drainage purposes. Arterial roadway widths may vary from 24 to 52 feet.
H. For streets and roadways on the Functional Classification System of the County, prevailing design standards shall apply.
I. Wherever possible, there shall be an inside tangent at least 100 feet in length introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
J. Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for horizontal sight distances on all curves depending upon design speed. These distances shall be:
Arterial Streets: 500 feet
Collector Streets: 300 feet
Local Streets: 200 feet
The sight distance shall be measured within street rights of way from a height of four and one-half feet above the proposed pavement surface in the right-hand lane of the roadway.
K. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 80 degrees.
L. Street jogs are to be avoided on arterial and collector streets. On local streets, center line offsets of less than 150 feet should be avoided.
M. Roadway grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves:
Roadway Type Percent Grade
Arterial 3%
Collector 4%
Local 5%
Marginal Access 5%
N. No roadway grade shall be less than 0.4 of one percent, unless approved by the applicable engineer. Greater percentages of grade may be required where necessary to provide adequate drainage.

Local Residential Arterial 30 feet
Commercial/Industrial Commercial/Industrial
Collector or Arterial Collector or Arterial 50 feet
P. Half-streets shall be avoided, except for arterial streets and collector streets where applicable, or where they are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; or, when the Planning Commission finds that it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half-street, or portion thereof, exists and is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. No construction of the roadway shall occur until the full right of way is provided.
Q. The length of cul-de-sacs and the dimensions of the turnaround shall be determined as follows:
1. Cul-de-sacs in single-family areas should not generally be longer than seven times the average lot width or 500 feet, whichever is less. In multiple-family residential areas, such streets shall not exceed 300 feet.
2. In urban type subdivisions, they shall have a turn diameter of at least 70 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet, or shall have a turnaround area such as hammerheads, etc., as providing service equal to the foregoing requirement when an alternative design is warranted by the particular design features of the subdivision.
3. For rural type subdivisions, a minimum street property line diameter of 120 feet or more may be required for fire protection and other equipment.
R. Subdividers are encouraged to consider projects designed to maximize solar access when not in conflict with existing contours or drainage. When the long axis of individual structures is parallel to the street, streets should be oriented as nearly as possible in an east/west direction. If the long axis of structures is perpendicular to the street, north/south street orientation is preferable for solar access purposes.

108 Alleys.
A. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas, except that the Planning Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking spaces consistent and adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys in residential districts are to be discouraged.
B. When provided, the minimum right of way of an alley shall be 20 feet.
C. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, a turning radius shall be provided to permit safe vehicular movement.
D. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end.
109 Blocks and Pedestrian Ways.
A. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable for the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, off-street parking and loading, etc.
3. Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
4. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. A block should not exceed 1,340 feet in length, unless the previous layout or topographic conditions justify a modification. In general, blocks shall not be less than 400 feet unless necessary because of existing street patterns.
C. All blocks shall be so designed so as to provide two tiers of lots, unless a different arrangement is required in order to comply with or be permitted by other sections of these regulations.
D. Blocks may be irregular in shape, provided they are harmonious with the overall pattern of blocks in the proposed subdivision.
E. In extra long blocks, a public pedestrian way may be required to provide access to public or private facilities such as schools or parks. (See Section 2-102 for definition of PEDESTRIAN WAY [CROSSWALK].)

110 Lots.
A. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building setback lines, if any desired, shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of urban and rural development and use contemplated. (See Section 6-106 for flag lots.)
B. Lot dimensions shall conform to the minimum requirements of applicable City or County zoning regulations and County sanitary code, unless higher standards are established in accordance with this subsection:
1. All subdivisions in the City shall be connected to public water supply and sewage disposal systems as well as subdivisions in the surrounding jurisdiction wherever the latter is deemed feasible by the Governing Body.*
2. If the proposed subdivision in the unincorporated area is serviced by either a public water supply or an on-lot water well and a septic tank and tile field or a wastewater lagoon for sewage disposal, the minimum lot size requirement according to the County sanitary code shall be five acres (217,800 square feet). If more than three such lots are proposed for a subdivision, a public sewage disposal system is required.**
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of these regulations in Section 6-110B2, it is the intent of these regulations to encourage the installation of public water supplies and public sewage disposal systems wherever feasible. In order to determine such feasibility, the Planning Commission may require the subdivider to provide certain basic engineering data and cost estimates on which to base such a decision. Furthermore, if on-lot water supply and sewage disposal installations are used, additional lot area may be required if the area to be subdivided has a high water table, is periodically flooded with water or if the soil conditions prove to be unsuitable based on percolation tests which may be required of the subdivider.**
────────────────────────
* NOTE: All public sanitary sewer systems and sewage treatment plants are further subject to the regulations of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
** NOTE: In calculating the size of the zoning lot, the land in an adjacent right of way may not be included if it is part of the legal description of the lot.

C. In those areas where there may be municipal-type water and/or sanitary sewer facilities anticipated in the foreseeable future, but which are not yet available, the Planning Commission may require that lots be so designed and arranged that they may readily be converted to urban type building sites without replatting. When such a condition prevails, land should be subdivided into lots so that by combining lots, a building site is created initially with an area of not less than that required for on-lot wells and/or sewage treatment systems. The creation of such a building site through use of multiple groups of lots shall be contingent upon the establishment for record of restrictive covenants satisfactory to the legal counsel of the Planning Commission, providing that no more than one dwelling unit shall be built on such an aggregate group of lots until such time as municipal-type water and sewer service is available.
D. As a general guideline, the maximum depth of all residential lots shall not exceed two and one-half times the width thereof. For all other types of lots, the depth shall not exceed three times the width.
E .Both in the City and unincorporated area, the area of the street right of way shall not be included and calculated in the size of the lot with respect to minimum lot size requirements of these regulations or of any zoning regulations applicable to the property. Lots shall be required to have more than the minimum area dimensions provided for in this section where such greater area or dimensions are required to meet the yard requirements of the zoning regulations.
F. There shall be no double frontage lots for individual dwellings (e.g., single and two-family units), except where the lots abut upon a limited access highway or arterial street or where the topography of the land prevents reasonable subdivision in small units. Double frontage lots shall not have vehicular access between such lots and an abutting limited access highway or arterial street.
G. Reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where such are essential to provide a separation of residential development from limited access highways and arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
H. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width, if necessary, to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
I. Side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the street line or substantially so.

111 Easements.
A. Utility easements shall be provided where necessary and centered on rear or side lot lines. Such easements shall be at least 20 feet wide along rear lot lines and 10 feet wide along side lot lines, except that easements for street lighting purposes shall not in any event be required to exceed 10 feet. Side lot easements, when needed for other than street lighting purposes such as drainage, may exceed 10 feet.
B. Drainage Easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or channel or a detention pond is constructed, then a storm water easement or drainage right of way shall be provided. Such easement or right of way shall conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse and location of a detention pond and shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary to assure adequate storm water drainage and for access for maintenance thereof. All drainage easements shall be vegetated with perennial grasses or otherwise stabilized to prevent soil erosion and sediment movement by wind or water. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. (See Section 2-102 for definition of DETENTION POND.)
In rural type subdivisions, a triangular drainage and utility easement may be required at the corners of intersecting street rights of way. Where street rights of way intersect at 90 degrees, the limit of such easement would be defined by a line drawn between two points located on the right of way lines which are 25 feet back in each direction from the corner.
C. Vision triangle easements may be required on any corner lot to provide an open and usable vision path for drivers of vehicles approaching the intersection. The extent of vision triangle easements shall be based on the type of intersection (3-way, four, protected, unprotected, etc.); the type of street (local, collector, arterial, commercial or industrial); topography; proposed street grades (if any); and the design speeds contemplated for such roadways. (See Section 2-102 for definition of VISION TRIANGLE.)
D. Wherever a lot or group of lots side or back on to an existing high pressure oil or gas transmission line, a building setback easement shall be established on each side of such line to the minimum safe standards as provided by the applicable oil or gas company to the subdivider or to such standards as may be adopted by the City, state or federal governments, whichever provides the most setback distance. The easement shall be provided on that part of the lot which abuts the oil or gas line and no principal buildings or structures shall be located or constructed within such an easement. Because of the many variables inherit in the establishment of such a setback easement, the City assumes no liability in such a determination.
E. A screening easement may be required to provide for fencing and/or an adequate area for the mature growth of landscaping with appropriate maintenance. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SCREENING.)

112 Commercial and Industrial Subdivisions.
A. Streets. Notwithstanding the other provisions of these regulations, the minimum width of streets adjacent to areas designed, proposed or zoned for commercial or industrial use may be increased by the Planning Commission to such extent as may be deemed necessary to assure the free flow of through traffic without interference from parked or parking motor vehicles.
B. Blocks and lots intended for commercial or industrial use shall be designed specifically for such purpose with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading.
C. Marginal Access Street. When lots or blocks in a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision front on any limited access highway or arterial street, the subdivider may be required to dedicate and improve a marginal access street to provide ingress and egress to and from such lots or blocks.

ARTICLE 7. INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
100 Subdivision Types. For the purposes of these regulations, subdivisions shall be classified as follows:
A. Urban Type Subdivisions.
1. All subdivisions located wholly within the corporate limits of the City.
2. All subdivisions located partially within, adjoining or touching the corporate limits of the City.
3. All subdivisions adjoining or touching the boundary of a tract of land for which annexation proceedings have commenced by the City or the owner has a pending request to be annexed.
4. All subdivisions adjoining or touching another subdivision which has previously received final plat approval by the City and adjoins or touches the corporate limits of the City.
5. All subdivisions which have or intend to have both municipal type water supply and sewage disposal systems, or are subdividing all or portions of the subdivision for commercial or industrial purposes, or for public or semi-public purposes which are directly related to an urban type residential subdivision. (Note: Service by a rural water district could be considered a "municipal type" if the particular size of pipes in that location permitted ade-quate quantity and pressure commensurate with urban needs.)
B. Rural Type Subdivisions. All other subdivisions required to be platted by these regulations not otherwise classified as the urban type as described in Section 7-100A.
101 Engineering and Governmental Jurisdiction. In setting certain standards and specifications, approving engineering drawings, inspecting improvements, recommending acceptance of improvements, preparing petition forms and establishing the amount of surety for guaranteeing the installation of such improvements; the engineer designated by the City, the County Engineer, or utility provider representative shall be designated as responsible for the improvements within their respective jurisdictions. The term "applicable" Governing Body may mean either the City Council for urban type subdivisions in the City, or the township trustees or County Board of Commissioners for urban and rural type subdivisions in the unincorporated area. "The" Governing Body refers to the City only. Coordination to achieve cooperation among the governing bodies is the responsibility of the City and, in particular, the Subdivision Administrator.

102 Required Improvements. As a condition to final plat acceptance, the subdivider of a proposed subdivision shall be responsible to install or, in cooperation with governmental bodies and utility companies, cause to be installed the following necessary facilities and improvements as listed below. The design and installation of such facilities and improvements shall include such sizing of pipes and extensions of streets as may be deemed desirable within the subdivision to facilitate development of adjacent land. All requirements are applicable to both urban and rural- type subdivisions as defined in Section 7-100 unless specifically described otherwise.
A. All streets, alleys, curbs, gutters and street drainage facilities in urban type subdivisions shall be constructed in accordance with established City standards. All urban type streets shall be con-structed of concrete, asphalt or asphaltic concrete and no gravel or sanded roadways shall be constructed. All roadways in rural type subdivisions shall be constructed in accordance with standards established by the County Engineer with gravel or sanded surface and no other materials such as oiled surface, macadam or similar materials shall be used. If other than gravel or sanded surface materials are particularly required, urban construction standards as described above shall apply. To accommodate any future improvements in both urban and rural areas, the entire right-of-way of collector and local streets and roadways shall be graded to match the level of the road surface. All stumps, trees that cannot be saved, boulders and similar items shall be removed from such right-of-way. In the unincorporated area, streets and roadways are subject to final acceptance by the applicable township trustees or the County.
B. A storm drainage system shall be provided, separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system, meeting all of the specifications and requirements of the City in urban type subdivisions or the County Engineer in rural types. Such storm drainage system shall be connected to any existing storm sewer system, where available, or if such connection is not available, other adequate means for the discharge of such storm water including the use of detention ponds shall be provided by the subdivider into the nearest major water channel. If it is determined that adequate drainage can be accomplished by a natural drainage way across private property, a drainage easement may be required; however, any initial channelization is the responsibility of the subdivider and continued maintenance the responsibility of the adjacent property owner(s). *
C. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City in urban type subdivisions under the following conditions: (Also, see Section 6-109E for pedestrian ways.)
1. Sidewalks may be required on one or both sides of the street when needed to service pedestrian traffic flow leading to schools, parks, shopping areas or places of public assembly and where heavy traffic would warrant sidewalks for safety purposes. Sidewalks may also be required in residential areas where the lot frontage is less than 150 feet. Sidewalks shall be required to extend or complete connecting links in the sidewalk system.
* Note: When required by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, non-point source storm water permit applications must be filed before construction begins under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (N.P.D.E.S.).

2. In general, sidewalks shall be constructed with the inside edge of the sidewalk one foot outside the property line, except in the central business district.
3. All sidewalks shall provide handicap access in conformity with K.S.A. 58-1301 et seq. and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USCA 12101, as may be amended.
D. Street signs shall be installed in accordance with specifications set by the applicable Governing Body subject to the standards of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices as adopted by the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Transportation and endorsed by the Federal Highway Administrator. (See K.S.A. 8-2003 for sign manual.)
E. Wherever a municipal-type water supply system or its equivalent is required to be constructed by these regulations, such construction shall be in accordance with the standards and requirements set by the applicable agency supplying the water. In all other areas, a water supply shall be provided which meets the standards of the County sanitary code. In those areas where there is a municipal type water supply system, mains shall be of such size as to support the use of fire hydrants as required by Section 7-102F.
F. Fire hydrants of the type and quality specified by City standards, but not less than the minimum standards of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), shall be provided wherever there shall be constructed a municipal type water supply system. Such hydrants shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the applicable Fire Chief.
G. Sanitary Sewer Systems.
1. Wherever sanitary sewers are to be installed as required by these regulations, such sewers are to be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City subject to the regulations of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
2. Wherever septic tank systems or wastewater lagoons are to be used for sewage disposal on individual lots, the determination of the suitability of the lot(s) and the standards for installation and inspection of such facilities shall be governed by the County sanitary code.
H. Underground wiring in residential subdivisions, unless found to be unfeasible, is required for electric power, street lights and telephone service in urban type subdivision, except:
1. For lines rated over 12,000 volts;
2. Appurtenance serving such lines which may be mounted on the ground, such as transformers, transformer pads, telephone service pedestals and street light poles; or
3. For those proposed subdivisions or replats of existing subdivisions located in areas which presently have an overhead type utility distribution system.

All rights reserved. 7-4
All such installation shall be under contract with the applicable utility provider. Cable television, if installed, shall be placed underground in accordance with the above requirements. Where tele-phone, electric, street lights and gas lines are placed underground entirely throughout a sub-division, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services. Further, all transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring underground installation of lines beyond the boundaries of the area contained in the preliminary plat.
All utility lines for telephone and electric service, when carried on overhead poles in other than the above urban type subdivision, shall be placed in rear lot line easements or designated side lot line easements.
I. If screening of public or private areas is to be required, a screening plan of landscaping and/or fencing shall be prepared and approved by the Planning Commission and such screening installed. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SCREENING.)
J. Monuments as shown on the final plat shall be placed at all central points such as block corners, angle points, points of curves in streets and as may be required by the applicable engineer. Monuments shall be made of iron pipes or solid steel rods, e.g., rebars which are not less than one-half inch in outside diameter and not less than 24 inches in length and affixed with a plastic or metal cap which identifies the registration number of the surveyor in responsible charge. All monuments shall be securely placed and set in such a manner that the top of the monument shall be at grade ground level. If cultivation of the land for farming purposes is anticipated, monuments may be lowered nine inches below grade ground level. Bench marks may also be required of such material, size and length as may be approved by the applicable engineer. (See Section 2-102 for definitions of BENCH MARK and MONUMENT and Sections 5-101 D and E for monuments and bench mark(s) to be shown on the final plat.)
K. Whenever existing sanitary or storm water sewers, water lines, drainage channels, culverts, underground or overhead electric and communication lines, gas lines, pipe lines, transmission lines are required to be relocated due to the subdivision or construction of improvements required as a condition of approval of the subdivision and in the event such was not known at the time of subdivision approval for any reason, the costs of such relocation shall be the sole responsibility of the subdivider.
L. Where required, applicable measures will be taken during construction to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation by wind or water. Conservation standards shall be adhered to which have been adopted by the County Conservation District.

103 Exceptions for Existing Improvements.
A. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently having any or all required improvements as set out in Section 7-102 and where such improvements meet the requirements of said section and are in good condition as determined by the applicable Governing Body, no further provision need be made by the subdivider to duplicate such improvements. Where such existing improvements, however, do not meet the requirements, the subdivider shall provide for the repair, correction or replacement of such improvements so that all improvements will then meet the aforesaid requirements.
B. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently abutting or containing any existing public street of less than the minimum required right of way width or roadway width, land shall be dedicated in so far as is possible so as to provide for a minimum street right of way width and an additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards as set by these regulations. The applicable Governing Body shall determine what adjustment to make where the aforesaid widenings merge with existing streets which are of smaller width at the boundary of such proposed subdivision. The minimum right of way and roadway width required by these regulations may be reduced to match an existing roadway system if the extension of such roadway is already improved at each end of the roadway in the subdivision.
104 Agreement and Guarantees for Installation of Required Improvements. Except for monuments, one of the following methods shall be used by the subdivider to guarantee that improvements required by these regulations can or will be installed in accordance with approved plans and specifications. This does not preclude the possibility that the applicable Governing Body may, at its discretion and in recognition of its financial position, share in the cost of improvements, especially oversized improve-ments which may benefit other related areas or the municipality-at-large: (See Section 2-102 for definition of HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION.)
A. Fiscal sureties may be offered and the following shall apply: (See Section 2-102 for definition of SUBDIVIDER'S AGREEMENT.)
1. The subdivider shall enter into a "Subdivider's Agreement" with the applicable Governing Body under which the subdivider agrees to install such required improvements. Such agreement shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the final plat by the applicable Governing Body and filed with the applicable Clerk.
2. Simultaneously with the execution of the Subdivider's Agreement provided for in Section 7-104A1, the subdivider shall furnish a corporate completion bond by a firm authorized to do business in Kansas with good and sufficient sureties thereon or a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the applicable Governing Body, in the amount of the estimated cost as approved by the official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the installation of the required improvements. Such financial guarantee shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the final plat and further conditioned upon the actual completion and satisfactory installation of such required improvements within two years from the date that the final plat is accepted by the Governing Body.

All rights reserved. 7-6
3. Simultaneously with the execution of the Subdivider's Agreement provided for in Section 7-104A1, if the subdivider furnishes a corporate completion bond, he or she shall also deposit in escrow with the applicable Governing Body cash in the amount of 15% of the cost of all improvements to be made in accordance with the plans and specifications for required improvements or an equivalent amount in the form of a maintenance bond or other securities that may be deemed sufficient by the applicable Governing Body. If a subdivider furnishes a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit, 15% of the amount of such guarantees shall be returned by, or held as a deposit in escrow after, the final completion of such improvements. The subdivider shall agree that such deposit in escrow may be held by the applicable Governing Body for a period of 18 months after such improvements are completed for the purpose of:
a. Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in material or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in character, and not discernible at the time of final inspection or acceptance by the applicable Governing Body; and
b. Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of the settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof.
Such escrow agreement shall provide that, as such defects have so developed, that the deposit may be applied by the applicable Governing Body for any amounts incurred correcting such defects; and that the balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of such 18-month period shall be returned by the applicable Governing Body to the depositor, or paid to the order of the depositor without payment of interest.
B. Petitions to the applicable Governing Body may be submitted as a means of guaranteeing to such Governing Body the authority to install improvements at such time as they deem appropriate. Petitions may be submitted only when the following conditions exist:
1. The petitions must be valid as may be provided for under Kansas law.
2. The petitions must be approved by the applicable Governing Body concurrently with the acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the applicable Governing Body concurrently with the petition approval or as soon thereafter as may be provided by law. The cost of the publication of said resolution shall be born by the subdivider.
4. A certificate signed by the petitioner must be recorded with the County Register of Deeds stating that such petitions have been filed and approved by the applicable Governing Body and that certain land within the plat as described will be liable in the future for special assessment for the required improvements authorized.

All rights reserved. 7-7
C. For streets and related drainage only in rural type subdivisions, preconstruction of improvements as an alternative method of guaranteeing their installation may be used if approved by the County Governing Body. In this event, the subdivider may request such Governing Body to hold the final plat acceptance until such time as an inspection certifies that the required improvements have been properly constructed. Such a preconstruction procedure shall be temporarily conditioned on subsequent acceptance of the final plat and a time limit for actual construction mutually agreed upon. Maintenance guarantees may also be required if deemed desirable. (See Section 7-104A3 for maintenance guarantee methods.)
D. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter from the utility provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have been made by the subdivider guaranteeing the installation of their respective services.
E. Monuments and bench marks shall be installed and their installation certified by a licensed land surveyor on the final plat before such plat is recorded with the County Register of Deeds. (See Section 5-101 Q 1 for Land Surveyor's Certificate.)
105 Off-site Improvements. The applicable Governing Body may, upon making a finding of necessity, require the subdivider to install or upgrade off-site improvements located outside the perimeter of a subdivision if such need is substantially created by a proposed subdivision. Such off-site improve-ments should be within dedicated rights of way or easements and serve a public purpose. The financing and guaranteeing of such improvements shall be administered as if they were the same as on-site improvements under Section 7-104. The applicable Governing Body may require such subdivision to participate in the following facilities and improvements, or any other off-site improvements as recommended by the Planning Commission, if the need is created by a proposed subdivision:
A. Drainage improvements;
B. Pedestrian ways and sidewalks;
C. Screening;
D. Special grading requirements;
E. Street improvements; or
F. Traffic control devices.

ARTICLE 8. IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES
100 Submittal of Petitions. If petitions are proposed to meet the requirements of Article 7, the subdivider shall so indicate at the time of submittal of the preliminary plat. If the petition method is authorized by the applicable Governing Body, petitions shall accompany the final plat for approval by such Governing Body.
101 Final Improvement Plans. When the use of petitions has not been requested by the subdivider or authorized by the applicable Governing Body and a letter(s) of satisfactory arrangements from a utility provider(s) are not being utilized to guarantee improvements (See Section 7-104D for letter from utility), the subdivider shall have prepared by an engineer (which may be contracted for privately or with any governmental agency or utility), engineering drawings for proposed required improvements containing the data and information specified in Section 8-101A. Such drawings shall be certified by a licensed engineer and shall be submitted to the applicable reviewing official in duplicate at least 20 days prior to the date that approval is requested.
A. Content. The engineering drawings shall contain the following data plus additional information deemed necessary by the applicable engineer:
1. Plans, details, specifications and cost estimates for roadway, alley and sidewalk construction; including plans, profile indicating existing topography and elevation including curb and sidewalk elevation when required, intersection control elevation and paving geometrics for each street with a typical cross section of the roadway. The profiles of grade lines shall be shown to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one inch equals 10 feet vertical; or to a scale approved by the applicable engineer. This information shall be shown on standard plan and profile sheets unless otherwise required by such engineer and use topographic information cited in Section 5-100B3.
2. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed storm drainage improvements.
3. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed water distribution system, water supply facilities and fire hydrants.
4. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed sanitary sewage system.
5. All plans for other utilities such as for electric, gas and telephone shall be prepared by or at the direction of the utility providing the service.
B. Review. The applicable engineer, official or agency responsible for determining specifications and standards shall review all engineering drawings in order to determine whether such drawings are consistent with the approved final plat and comply with the design standards. If such drawings are consistent and so comply, the reviewing official shall forward to the applicable Governing Body a notice to that effect. In the event that the drawings do not so comply, the
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2010.
All rights reserved. 8-2
reviewing official shall notify the subdivider of the specific manner in which such drawings do not comply, and he or she may then correct such drawings. If such drawings are not corrected, the reviewing official shall forward to such Governing Body a notice as to the items of nonconformity or noncompliance.
102 Construction of Improvements. No improvements shall be constructed nor shall any work preliminary thereto be done, except as provided for under a preconstruction agreement in rural-type subdivisions, until such time as the engineering construction drawings shall have been approved and there shall have been compliance with all of the requirements relating to the Subdivider's Agreement and such guarantees as are specified in Section 7-104 of these regulations.
A. Inspection. All improvements constructed or erected shall be subject to inspection by the applicable engineer or official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the required improvements. The cost attributable to all inspections required by these regulations shall be charged to and paid by the subdivider. In so far as is possible, the subdivider shall give at least 48 hours notification to such official prior to the performance of any inspection work.
B. Inspection Procedures. After notice is received as specified in Section 8-102A above, the applicable engineer or official designated may conduct an on-site inspection to determine that the work complies with the approved engineering plans and specifications. If in the opinion of such engineer or official, the work does not comply with such final drawings, he or she shall have authority to order that all such work shall be terminated until such time as necessary steps are taken to correct any defects or deficiencies. Upon the correction of such defects or deficiencies, the subdivider shall again notify the applicable engineer or official as provided in Section 8-102A that the work is again ready for inspection.
C. Final Inspection. Upon completion of all improvements within the area covered by the final plat, the subdivider shall notify the applicable engineer or official designated in Section 8-102A above, who shall thereupon conduct a final inspection of all improvements installed. If such final inspection indicates that there are any defects or deficiencies in such improvements as installed, or if there are any deviations in such improvements as installed from the final engineering plans and specifications, he or she shall notify the subdivider in writing and the subdivider shall, at their sole cost and expense, correct such defects or deviations within six months of the date of notification. When such defects, deficiencies or deviations have been corrected, the subdivider shall notify the official that the improvements are again ready for final inspection. After the final inspection is made and before acceptance of the improvement by the applicable Governing Body, the subdivider shall file a statement with the engineer or official which is executed by the subdivider, certifying that all obligations incurred in the construction of the improvement involved have been properly paid and settled.

103 Acceptance of Improvements. If a final inspection indicates that all improvements as installed contain no unacceptable defects, deficiencies or deviations, within 15 days from the submission of the subdivider's statement of obligation paid, the applicable engineer or official designated shall certify to the applicable Governing Body and utility provider(s) that all improvements have been installed in conformity with the engineering plans and specifications accompanying the final plat. Upon the receipt by the applicable Governing Body of such notification and in conformity with the requirements of these regulations and all other applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations, such Governing Body shall thereupon by resolution or utility by letter formally accept such improvements. The improvements shall become the property of such Governing Body or utility provider involved. Prior to this final action, however, neither the acceptance of the final plat, any subsequent annexation to the City or irrespective of any act(s) of employees, such actions shall not constitute their formal acceptance of improvements.

ARTICLE 9. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS
100 Application Procedure. The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to approve or disapprove lot splits. An application with the required fee for a lot split approval shall be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator by the owner of the land at least 20 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) Four copies of a drawing to scale of the lots involved if there are no structures on the lot shall accompany the application or four copies of a survey if there are structures on the lot showing the precise location of structures thereon. Each drawing or survey shall show the location, dimensions and legal description of the proposed split; the square footage contained in each portion of the original lot; all existing easements including public reservations such as building setback lines or access control and a certificate of approval as worded in Section 9-101C. (See Section 2-102 for definition of LOT SPLIT.)
Written notices shall be distributed by the Administrator to all owners of land adjacent to the property proposed to be split including such owners across the street or other public way. The application for a lot split must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all persons to receive notices. Such owners shall have 10 days from the date of mailing the notification to inform the Administrator of any protest or concerns they may have on the lot split. The 10 day waiting period may be waived upon presentation of a written statement of no objection from those to be notified.
101 Approval Guidelines. Approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be made based on the following guidelines:
A. A lot split shall not be approved unless all of the following requirements have or can be satisfied:
1. A new street or alley or extension of an existing street or alley is required or proposed.
2. A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required and has not been satisfied.
3. Such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g., utilities, drainage, sidewalks, traffic control, streets, etc. or will interfere with maintaining existing service levels, e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.
4. There is less street right of way than required by these regulations or the Comprehensive Plan unless such dedication can be made by separate instrument.
5. All easement requirements have not been satisfied.
6. Such split will result in a lot without direct access from its frontage to an opened public street. (See Section 6-106 for Access.)
7. A substandard sized lot will be created or an existing structure will not be able to meet all yard requirements according to applicable zoning regulations or sanitary code.

All rights reserved. 9-2
8. The lot is subject to periodic flooding which cannot be feasibly corrected in order to properly develop the lot.
9. The lot has been previously split without replatting.
B. The Planning Commission may make such additional requirements as deemed necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of existing land development regulations and applicable Governing Body policy. Requirements may include, but not be limited to, the installation of public facilities, water supply and sewage disposal and/or the dedication of right of way and easements.
C. The Planning Commission shall, in writing, either approve with or without conditions or disapprove the lot split within 45 days of application. If approved, and after all conditions have been met, the Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall sign the following certificate of approval as required on the lot split drawing or survey. Acknowledgement of the certificate may be made by a notary public or by the County Clerk, Register of Deeds, Mayor or Clerk. (See K.S.A. 58-2211, as amended.)

ARTICLE 10. VACATIONS AND CORRECTIONS
100 Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.
A. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Planning Commission, a preliminary or final plat may be withdrawn from consideration either before or after approval by the Commission. Upon approval of the request by a motion of the Commission, the Subdivision Administrator is automatically directed to remove the case file from the City records.
B. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Clerk, a final plat for which dedications, if any, have been accepted by the applicable Governing Body may be vacated by motion of such Governing Body; provided, that (1) the plat has not been recorded; (2) no lots have been sold or transferred; and (3) no improvements have been installed. After the plat is vacated, the Administrator shall see that all fiscal sureties are returned to the subdivider except for those expenditures which have been incurred by the City or County in administrative, legal or engineering costs prior to the date of the request for vacation. Upon the return of such sureties, the Administrator is automatically directed to remove the case file including any petitions from the City records.
C. Upon determining from the County Register of Deeds that a final plat has not been recorded within 60 days from its final acceptance by the Governing Body or within 15 days after a final acceptance by the County Governing Body under the preconstruction procedures of Section 7-104C, the Administrator shall notify the subdivider that the plat is null and void and that the case file will be removed from the City records within 30 days unless a reapplication for platting is received during that time. (See Section 4-112 for Recording of Final Plat.)
101 Vacation of Recorded Plat.
A. (Inside the City or in the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area.) Recorded plats may be vacated by either replatting according to Section 10-101A1 below or directly vacated according to Section 10-101A2:
1. According to K.S.A. 12-512b, any recorded plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public reservation, including, without limitation, easements, dedicated building setback lines and access control, whether established by instrument, condemnation or earlier plats, shall be vacated both as to use and as to title without any further proceedings upon the filing and recording with the County Register of Deeds in accordance with K.S.A. 12-403, any plat or replat duly executed in accordance with these regulations which embraces the same lands as those heretofore embraced by the earlier plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public reservation. Streets, alleys or other public reservations which may be vacated shall revert, as provided for in K.S.A. 12-506, to abutting property owners according to their frontage thereon; provided, that such land to be reverted was derived directly or indirectly from the owner of the land from which such street, alley or public reservation was originally platted. The proper completion of the Owner's Certificate and Dedication as required by Section 5-101 Q 2 shall constitute appropriate notice to all persons having property rights or interests affected by the above platting or replatting.

All rights reserved. 10-2
2. Recorded plats may also be vacated without replatting. The procedure is the same as provided for in Section 10-103.
102 Correction of Platting Errors.
A. According to K.S.A. 12-420, procedures are provided to correct certain platting errors. If, after recording a final plat, an error is found in distances, angles, bearings, subdivision or street names, block or lot numbers, the computation of dimension or elevation or other details of the plat, except in connection with the outer boundaries of the plat, and if the property described in that part of the plat containing the error is under the ownership of the person who caused the plat to be prepared, the applicable City or County Engineer, after substantiation of the existence of the error, may file an affidavit with the County Register of Deeds that the error was made. The affidavit shall describe the nature and extent of the error and the appropriate correction. The Register of Deeds shall record the affidavit and shall place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation that the affidavit has been filed, the date of filing and the book and page where it is recorded. The filing of the affidavit shall correct any such errors, but shall have no effect on the validity of the plat or any property interest recorded by reference thereto. A copy of the recorded affidavit shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator. The County will bill the person requesting the correction for engineering costs and recording fees.
103 Vacation of Streets, Alleys, Easements and Plats.
A. (Inside the City only.) According to K.S.A. 12-504 and 505, the following procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys or other public reservations such as, but not limited to public easements, dedicated building setback lines, access control, or a part thereof, and including all or parts of recorded plats:*
1. Petitions for vacations received from the Governing Body, the owner of platted land or the owner of land adjoining on both sides of any street, alley, easement or other public reservation may be filed with the Clerk and transmitted to the Subdivision Administrator for processing. All nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) The Planning Commission shall give public notice of a hearing on a proposed vacation by publication once in the official city newspaper by the Subdivision Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice shall state (1) the nature of the vacation petition, (2) the legal description of the property and (3) the date, time and place for the hearing before the Planning Commission. The notice may contain the information that the hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue in the future at some stated
* Note: The same statutory procedure may be used to exclude a portion of land from the boundaries of the City, i.e., the land could also be "deannexed".

date, time and place. Furthermore, the Commission by rule shall mail a notice to all affected utility providers; all owners of land proposed for vacation; all landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open; and owners on the opposite side of the street from vacations of setbacks and access control. The petitioner(s) shall provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator, includ-ing names, addresses and zip codes. Such notice to providers and landowners shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date.
2. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the vacation should be approved or disapproved and with or without conditions attached. At the hearing, the Planning Commission shall hear such testimony as may be presented or as may be required in order to fully understand the true nature of the petition and the propriety of recommending the same. If the Planning Commission determines from the testimony presented that:
a. due and legal notice has been given;
b. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
c. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
d. in justice to the petitioner(s) the vacation should be granted;
then the Planning Commission shall recommend that such vacation be approved and entered at length in the minutes. Such recommendation may provide for the reservation to the City and/or the owners of any lesser property rights for public utilities, rights of way and easements for public service facilities originally located in such vacated land or planned for the future. The recommendation may be conditioned upon the petitioner's responsibility to remove or relocate all underground or surface utilities or paving in or on the vacated land. The petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk, at or before the hearing, by any owner who would be a proper party to the petition, but has not joined therein. Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk by any owner of lands which adjoin the portion to be vacated. The recommendation of the Planning Commission to the Governing Body shall be made in the same manner as provided by K.S.A. 12-752 for the submission and approval of a final plat. (See Sections 4-107 and 108 for the 60-day time period for consideration of a plat and Section 4-110 for Governing Body approval procedure.) The Planning Commission shall announce at their hearing when the Governing Body will consider the recommendation on the vacation.

All rights reserved. 10-4
Following the approval of the vacation by the Governing Body in the form of an order, the Clerk shall certify a copy of the order to the County Register of Deeds; however, such certification shall be withheld until such time as any conditions attached to the order have been satisfied. The Register of Deeds shall note on the recorded plat of the "townsite," i.e., the City, or the applicable platted addition, the words, "canceled by order" or "canceled in part by order" and give the book and page where recorded.
B. (In the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area only.)
According to K.S.A. 58-2613 through 2615, the following procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys, public easements or public reservations, e.g., building setback lines and access control, and including all or parts of recorded plats:
1. The owners of any platted land proposed for vacation or the adjoining owners on both sides of any street, alley, public easement or public reservation, or part thereof, may file a petition to vacate with the Board of County Commissioners. Upon such filing, the County Commissioners shall fix a date, time and place for a hearing and publish a notice in the of-ficial county newspaper. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for the hearing. State statutes also require that notice of the hearing be given to the City Governing Body and the Planning Commission.
If the Commissioners are satisfied at the hearing that:
a. proper notice has been given;
b. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
c. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
then the Commissioners shall order such vacation be made and entered in the minutes of the proceedings. Such order shall protect and provide for the property rights of public utilities, rights of way and easements for public service facilities in existence and use. No such vacation shall be granted; however, if the City Governing Body protests against such vacation. Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be granted if a written objection is filed with the County Clerk by any owner of land which adjoins the portion to be vacated. The Clerk shall record a certified copy of the order with the County Register of Deeds. The petitioner shall pay the Clerk any cost of the proceedings including publication and recording costs.
2. Prior to the above hearing by the Board of County Commissioners, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the vacation should be recommended for approval by the County Commissioners with or without conditions attached or protested against. The Commission by rule shall mail a notice 10 days before the hearing to all affected utility providers; all owners of land proposed for vacation; all landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open; owners on the opposite side of the street from vacations of setbacks and access control; and the County Engineer. The petitioner(s) shall provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator, including

All rights reserved. 10-5
names, addresses and zip codes. All nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for fees.) The Planning Commission shall announce at their hearing when the Governing Body will consider the vacation and the date, time and place of the County Commissioners' hearing. Unless the Governing Body deems it desir-able to protest the vacation, a resolution shall be adopted to recommend the vacation to the County Commissioners which may or may not be subject to conditions. If conditions are required, the City Clerk may refrain from certifying the resolution until such time as the conditions are satisfied. After certification, the City Clerk will provide the petitioner with a copy of the resolution to be submitted to the County Commissioners.
3. In the event that the County has designated their planning board to hold the public hearing on the vacation, the certified resolution should be submitted for their hearing.

ARTICLE 11. APPEALS, WAIVERS AND MODIFICATIONS
100 Appeals General. The subdivider of a proposed subdivision may appeal decisions made in the enforcement of these regulations by the Subdivision Administrator to the Planning Commission and by the Planning Commission to the Governing Body. In the event the Governing Body sustains the Planning Commission, the action of the Planning Commission shall be final except as otherwise provided by law. If the Governing Body overrules the Planning Commission, the Governing Body shall make its decision, in writing or in the minutes of the meeting, stating the reason therefore and return such decision and plat to the Planning Commission for consideration of reapproval.
101 Appeals on Improvement Standards. Any appeal as to approval of standards or plans and engineering drawings in connection with required improvements shall be directed to the applicable Governing Body and that action shall be final.
102 Waiver of Required Improvements or Guarantees for Installation of Same. Any waiver of the required improvements or guarantees for their installation may be made only by the applicable Governing Body on a showing that such improvements are not technically feasible or necessary.
103 Modifications. In cases in which there is unwarranted hardship in carrying out the literal provisions of these regulations as to design standards, the Planning Commission may grant a modification from such provision according to the following guidelines: (See Article 6, Design Standards.)
A. A request for a modification shall be made to the Subdivision Administrator who shall transmit it to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall give the subdivider and any other interested person an opportunity to be heard with respect to the requested modification.
B. The Planning Commission shall not grant a modification unless it shall find that (1) the strict application of these regulations will create an unwarranted hardship; (2) modification is in harmony with the general spirit and intended purpose of these regulations; (3) the rights of adjacent property owners will not adversely be affected; and (4) the public safety, health and general welfare will be protected.
C. When used in this Section, the term "unwarranted hardship" shall mean the effective deprivation of use as distinguished from a mere inconvenience.
D. Modifications permitted under the provisions of this Article shall not include modifications from the requirements of improvement standards, required improvements or guaranteeing their installation unless approved by the applicable Governing Body as provided for in Sections 11-101 and 102. Furthermore, variances may not be granted from the provisions of applicable zoning regulations by these modification procedures.

All rights reserved. 12-1
ARTICLE 12. AMENDMENTS AND REVIEW
100 Amendment Procedure. These regulations may be amended at any time after the Planning Commission shall have held a public hearing on the proposed amendment. A notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the official city newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the publication date and the date of such hearing. Such notice shall fix the time and place for the hearing and shall describe such proposed amendment(s) in general terms. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time. At its conclusion, the Planning Commission shall prepare its recommendations and by an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission adopt the proposed amendments to these regulations and submit them, together with the written summary of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body.
The Governing Body either may: (1) Approve such recommendations by ordinance; (2) override the Planning Commission recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the City Council; or (3) return the same to the Commission for further consideration, together with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendations, the Commission after considering the same, may resubmit their original recommendations giving the reasons therefore or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by an ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If the Commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the Governing Body following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly. The amended regulations shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance. A copy of such legal publication shall be added to the Appendix of these regulations.
101 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations, the Planning Commission shall annually hold a public review at its regular meeting in January to consider amendments, if any, to these regulations. Notification of such a public review may be distributed to governmental agencies and interested parties. If amendments are deemed desirable, the amendment procedure as described in Section 12-100 shall be followed. During the intervening period between reviews, the Subdivision Administrator shall maintain a list of possible amendments which may be periodically brought to his or her attention.
102 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance, regulation or decision provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an action against the City within 30 days after a final decision is made by the City. Such action shall be brought in the Butler County District Court.
ARTICLE 13. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE
100 Severability. If any part or provision of these regulations is adjudged unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, then such part or provision shall be considered separately

All rights reserved. A-2
and apart from the remaining parts or provisions of these regulations, and said part or provision to be completely severable from the remainder of these regulations, and the remainder provisions of these regulations shall remain in full force and effect.
101 Effective Date. These regulations shall be in full force and effect from and after their adoption by the Planning Commission, approval by the Governing Body by an ordinance incorporating these regulations by reference as a Model Code and publication of such ordinance in the official city newspaper.

8.7.	Measurements and Calculations

A.	Primary  Building  Elevation

1.	The primary building elevation shall be any elevation  that faces onto a street right-of-way to which the parcel has street frontage and has the principal  entrance to the building or has an entry used  primarily for customers or clients.
2.	.   The wall area of the primary building elevation shall be determined as follows:
a.	When scaled architectural elevations are provided to depict the elevation of the structure, the vertical wall area of
the elevation shall be the wall surface of
the building elevation exclusive of roofs,
parapets and false fascia, except that a parapet on the primary building elevation, that is part of a parapet of a uniform height and building material on three sides of a structure may be included in the
elevation area, but decorative parapet extensions of irregular height on one or two sides of a structure are
excluded from the calculation .

b.	When architectural plans are not provided, it shall be assumed that the height of the elevation of the first floor is twelve ( 12) feet and that the height of the elevation of all floors above the first floor is ten ( 1O) feet per floor. The area of the elevation is then calculated based on the formula :

(building length x  12 feet)+ (building length x (number of additional floors x 10 feet))

B.	Setbacks for Signs

Setbacks for freestanding signs shall be measured from the farthest most protrusion of the sign or sign structure to the nearest point along the property line .
C.	Street Frontage

Street frontage shall be measured parallel to the centerline of the public street. Where a zoning lot has more than one public street frontage, street frontage shall be the combined linear street frontage .
D.	Sign Clearance

The sign clearance shall be measured from the highest point of the ground directly below the sign to the lowest point of the sign structure .

E.	Total Sign Height (also referred to as sign height)

1.	The total sign height of freestanding signs shall be measured from the ground elevation at the base of the sign structure to the highest element of the sign structure . For signs that may vary in height, such as inflatable signs, the total sign height shall be measured from the ground elevation at the base of the sign structure to the highest element of the sign structure at its peak elevation .
2 .		For building signs, the total sign height shall equal the sign face  height.
F.	Sign Area

1.	The sign area shall include the entire area of the sign face. The  area of a sign face shall be calculated by multiplying the sign face width by the sign face height using a rectangular shape that completely encloses the sign face.
2.	The sign area of a free-form sign shall include the entire area within a single rectangle enclosing the extreme limits of the
sign copy and other graphic element used to portray the sign 's message .

C.	The height compatibility setback shall be calculated  as follows:

(A)	Proposed  structure height

(B)	Zoning district maximum height

(C) Height compatibility multiplier= (A)+ (B); Round to nearest hundredth, down< 0.05, up;:: 0.05 Check against exempt restrictions : 3 or less for I- 1 zoning ; 2 or less for other zoning districts
(D)	Zoning district maximum required setback (any yard or use)

(E)	Height compatibility setback= (C) X (D); Round to nearest foot, down< 0.5, up;:: 0.5


Example Height Compatibility Setback Calculation

Scenario: The owner of a property zoned B- 1 submits an application for a 50-foot Aag pole .

(A)	Proposed structure height= 50 feet

(B)	Zoning district maximum height= 35 feet (non-residential structures)

(C) 50 + 35 = 1.428; Rounded up, height compatibility multiplier= 1.43

1.43 is less than 2 times the maximum height for B-1 zoning

(D)	Zoning district maximum required setback= 35 feet (front yard setback)

(E)	1.43 X 35 = 50.05; Rounded  down, height compatibility  setback  requirement=  50 feet

The flag pole must be built at least 50 feet away from all property lot lines.
