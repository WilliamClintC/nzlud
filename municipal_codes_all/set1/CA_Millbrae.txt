1.05.010 Violations, penalties and enforcement.
The city council of the city of Millbrae intends to secure compliance with the provisions of the Millbrae Municipal Code (to be known as “this code”). To the extent that such compliance may be achieved by less drastic methods of enforcement, the following alternate, separate and distinct methods may be utilized. Each method set forth herein is intended to be mutually exclusive and the city may use one or more methods concurrently or consecutively to achieve compliance against continuing violations. Unless otherwise provided in this code, each and every day a violation exists or is permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense. Except as provided in MMC 1.05.040, notwithstanding any other provision of this code, each violation of the provisions of this code may be enforced alternatively as follows:

A.    Infractions. Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this code may be prosecuted for an infraction. Police officers or employees designated by MMC 1.05.020 may issue written citations for infraction violations. Any person convicted of an infraction under the provisions of this code shall be punishable either by fines established by resolution of the city council, or where no fine is specified therein by:

1.    A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for a first violation;

2.    A fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for a second violation of the same ordinance within one year; and

3.    A fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for each additional violation of the same ordinance within one year.

B.    Misdemeanor. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any of the provisions or knowingly or willfully fails to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this code may be prosecuted for a misdemeanor. Written citations for misdemeanors may be issued by police officers or by employees designated by MMC 1.05.020. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or by both a fine and imprisonment.

C.    Administrative Citation. Upon a finding by a police officer or an employee designated by MMC 1.05.020 that a violation exists, he or she may issue an administrative citation under the provisions set forth in MMC 1.05.030.

D.    Nuisance. In addition to the penalties herein provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist or any act or conduct in violation of any of the provisions of this code, is a public nuisance, and the city may summarily abate such nuisance pursuant to the Community Preservation Ordinance, Chapter 6.25 MMC and applicable state laws. Each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense. (Ord. 680, § 1; 1976 Code § 1-1.01).

B.    Authority.

1.    Any person violating any provision of the Millbrae Municipal Code or applicable state code may be issued an administrative citation by an enforcement officer as provided in this chapter. A violation of this code includes, but is not limited to, all violations of the Millbrae Municipal Code, the California construction codes adopted by the city council, or the failure to comply with any condition imposed by any entitlement, permit, agreement or environmental document issued or approved under the provisions of this code.

2.    Each and every day a violation of this code or applicable state code exists constitutes a separate and distinct offense.

3.    A civil fine shall be assessed by means of an administrative citation issued by the enforcement officer and shall be payable directly to the city of Millbrae.

4.    A fine shall be assessed in the amount specified by resolution of the city council, or where no amount is specified:

a.    A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for a first violation;

b.    A fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for a second violation of the same ordinance, code, entitlement, permit, agreement or environmental document within one year from the date of the first violation; or

c.    A fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for each additional violation of the same ordinance, code, entitlement, permit, agreement or environmental document within one year from the date of the first violation.

C.    Service Procedures.

1.    An administrative citation on a form approved by the city manager may be issued to the responsible person by an enforcement officer for violations of the municipal code or applicable state code in the following manner.

a.    Personal Service. In any case where an administrative citation is issued the enforcement officer shall attempt to locate and personally serve the responsible person and obtain the signature of the responsible person on the administrative citation. If the responsible person served refuses or fails to sign the administrative citation, the failure or refusal to sign shall not affect the validity of the administrative citation or of any subsequent proceedings.

b.    Service of Citation by Mail. If the enforcement officer is unable to locate the responsible person, the administrative citation shall be mailed to the responsible person by certified mail, postage prepaid with a request return receipt. Simultaneously, a copy of the citation may be sent by first class mail. If the citation sent by certified mail is returned unsigned, then service shall be deemed effective pursuant to first class mail, provided the citation copy sent by first class mail is not returned.

c.    Service of Citation by Posting Notice. If the enforcement officer does not succeed in personally serving the responsible person, or by certified mail or regular mail, the enforcement officer shall post the administrative citation on any real property within the city in which the city has knowledge that the responsible person has a legal interest, and such posting shall be deemed effective service.

D.    Contents of Notice. Each administrative citation shall contain the following information:

1.    Date, approximate time, and address or definite description of the location where the violation(s) was observed;

2.    The code sections or conditions violated and a description of the violation(s);

3.    An order to the responsible person to correct the violations within the time specified, and an explanation of the consequences of failure to correct the violation(s);

4.    The amount of the fine for the violation(s);

5.    An explanation of how the fine shall be paid and the time period by which it shall be paid;

6.    Identification of rights of appeal, including the time within which the administrative citation may be contested and the place to obtain a request for hearing form to contest the administrative citation; and

7.    The name and signature of the enforcement officer and, if possible, the signature of the responsible person.

E.    Satisfaction of Administrative Citation. Upon receipt of an administrative citation, the responsible person must do the following:

1.    Pay the fine to the city within fifteen days from the correction date of the administrative citation. All fines assessed shall be paid to the city. Payment of a fine shall not excuse or discharge the failure to correct the violation(s) nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the city.

2.    Remedy the violation(s), if the violation(s) is of such a nature that it can be remedied. If the violation(s) is corrected before the date provided on the citation, no fine shall be imposed. If the responsible person fails to correct the violation(s), subsequent administrative citations may be issued for the same violation(s). The amount of the fine for failure to correct the violation(s) shall increase at a rate specified in this chapter or by resolution of the council.

F.    Appeal of Administrative Citation. Any recipient of an administrative citation may contest that there was a violation of the Millbrae Municipal Code or that he or she is the responsible person by completing a request for hearing form and returning it to the city within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the administrative citation, together with an advance deposit in the amount of the fine or notice that a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver has been filed pursuant to subsection (G) of this section. Any administrative citation fine which has been deposited shall be refunded if it is determined, after a hearing, that the person charged in the administrative citation was not responsible for the violation(s) or that there was no violation(s) as charged in the administrative citation.

G.    Advance Deposit Hardship Waiver.

1.    Any person who intends to request a hearing to contest that there was a violation of the code or that he or she is the responsible person and who is financially unable to make the advance deposit of the fines as required in subsection (F) of this section may file a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver.

2.    The request shall be filed with the department of finance on an advance deposit hardship waiver application form within ten days of the date of the administrative citation.

3.    The requirement of depositing the full amount of the fine as described in subsection (F) of this section shall be stayed unless or until the director of finance makes a determination not to issue the advance deposit hardship waiver.

4.    The director of finance may waive the requirement of an advance deposit set forth in subsection (F) of this section and issue the advance deposit hardship waiver only if the cited party submits to the director a sworn affidavit, together with any supporting documents or materials, demonstrating to the satisfaction of the director the person’s actual financial inability to deposit with the city the full amount of the fine in advance of the hearing.

5.    If the director of finance determines not to issue an advance deposit hardship waiver, the person shall remit the deposit to the city within ten days of the date of that decision or thirty days from the date of the administrative citation, whichever is later.

6.    The director of finance shall issue a written determination listing the reasons for his or her determination to issue or not issue the advance deposit hardship waiver. The written determination of the director of finance shall be final.

7.    The written determination of the director of finance shall be served upon the person who applied for the advance deposit hardship waiver.

H.    Hearing Officer. The city manager shall designate the hearing officer for the administrative citation hearing. The employment, performance evaluation, compensation and benefits of the hearing officer, if any, shall not be directly or indirectly conditioned upon the amount of administrative citation fines upheld by the hearing officer.

I.    Hearing Procedure.

1.    No hearing to contest an administrative citation before a hearing officer shall be held unless and until a request for hearing form has been completed and submitted, and, the fine has been deposited in advance.

2.    A hearing before the hearing officer shall be set for a date that is not less than fifteen and not more than sixty days from the date that the request for hearing is filed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The person requesting the hearing shall be notified of the time and place set for the hearing at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing.

3.    The hearing officer shall only consider evidence that is relevant to whether the violation(s) of the Millbrae Municipal Code or other applicable state code existed on the date(s) specified in the administrative citation.

4.    The responsible person contesting the administrative citation shall be given the opportunity to testify and present witnesses and evidence concerning the administrative citation.

5.    The failure of any recipient of an administrative citation to appear at the administrative citation hearing shall constitute a forfeiture of the fine and a failure to exhaust his or her administrative remedies.

6.    The administrative citation and any additional documents submitted by the enforcement officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the respective facts contained in those documents.

7.    If the enforcement officer submits an additional written report concerning the administrative citation to the hearing officer for consideration at the hearing, then a copy of this report also shall be served by mail on the person requesting the hearing at least five days prior to the date of the hearing.

4.    The recipient of the administrative citation shall be served with a copy of the hearing officer’s written decision.

K.    Failure to Pay Fines. The failure of any person to pay the civil penalty assessed by an administrative citation within the time specified on the citation will necessitate further action by the city to collect the fine, any attorney’s fees or other costs expended in the administrative citation process, including those attorney’s fees and costs incurred in the collection process. The city shall keep an itemized listing of all such expenses. The city may pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the civil penalties and these expenses, including but not limited to instituting a legal action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the debt, and/or filing a lien against the property where the violations of the city’s ordinance(s) occurred.

1.    Legal Action. The matter may be referred to the finance/IT service manager, the responsible department head, or the city attorney to file a legal action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the civil penalty assessed and any associated city expenses. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs shall be awarded to the prevailing party.

2.    Lien Procedure. The city may file a lien on the property at which the violations occurred in the following manner.

iv.    The deadline for requesting a hearing to challenge the imposition of the lien is thirty days from the date of the notice;

v.    Notice that the subject of the hearing is limited to any challenge to the imposition of the lien, and not the underlying fine and city expenses;

vi.    Notice that the city is entitled to statutory interest on the lien from the date the lien is filed;

c.    Hearing Officer. The city manager shall designate the hearing officer for the lien hearing in the same manner as provided in subsection (H) of this section.

The person requesting the hearing shall be notified of the time and place set for the hearing at least twenty days prior to the date of the hearing.

iii.    The hearing officer shall only consider evidence that is relevant to whether the lien shall be imposed, and the reasonableness of the city’s expenses.

iv.    The responsible person contesting the imposition of the lien shall be given the opportunity to testify and present witnesses and evidence concerning the imposition of the lien and the reasonableness of the city’s expenses.

v.    The hearing officer may impose the lien or deny its imposition. The hearing officer also may allow in whole or in part or disallow in whole or in part the inclusion of the city’s expenses in any lien imposed. The hearing officer may not reopen the issue of the amount of penalties imposed and may not consider that issue in deciding whether or not to impose the lien.

vi.    The failure of any responsible person to appear at the lien hearing shall constitute a waiver on the issue of the propriety of the city’s expenses and the imposition of the lien, and a failure to exhaust his or her administrative remedies.

vii.    The notice of lien and any additional documents submitted by the city shall constitute prima facie evidence of the respective facts contained in those documents.

viii.    If the city submits any additional documents concerning the imposition of the lien, or the amount of the city’s expenses, to the hearing officer for consideration at the hearing, then copies of those documents shall be served by mail on the person requesting the hearing at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing.

ii.    Both the city and the responsible party shall be served with a copy of the hearing officer’s written decision.

iii.    If the city prevails, it may file its lien in the amount allowed by the hearing officer. That lien shall have the same effect, force, and priority of a judgment lien, and may be collected when the property is sold. It shall be recorded in the county recorder’s office.

iv.    If the hearing officer determines that the city may not impose a lien, the city may pursue any and all alternate remedies.

e.    Right to Judicial Review. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the hearing officer at the lien hearing may obtain review of the decision as allowed under state law.

L.    Right to Judicial Review.

2.    Failure to receive any notice specified in this chapter does not affect the validity of proceedings conducted hereunder.

N.    Severability and Validity. If any section, subsection, paragraph or sentence of this chapter, or any part thereof, is for any reason found by a court of competent jurisdiction, to exist unconstitutional, invalid or beyond the authority of the city of Millbrae, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this chapter.

If the city council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security shall be applied by the city to the difference between the low bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder.

3. Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the department identified in the invitation for bid documents and shall be identified as bids on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notice. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than thirty calendar days after the bid opening.

4. Award of Contracts. Contracts shall be awarded by the city council to the lowest responsible bidder. The city council may, in its sole discretion, waive minor irregularities in the bids or in the bidding procedures. The city council may reject all bids presented, and readvertise for bids.

5. Tie Bids and No Bids. If two or more bids are the same and the lowest, the city council may accept the one it chooses. If no bids are received through the formal procedure, the project may be performed by city employees, by force account or negotiated contract without complying with this section.

6. Rejecting Bids and Performing Project through City Employees. In its discretion, the city council may reject any bids presented, if the city, prior to rejecting all bids and declaring that the project can be more economically performed by employees of the city, furnishes a written notice to an apparent low bidder. The notice shall inform the bidder of the city’s intention to reject the bid and shall be mailed at least two business days prior to the hearing at which the city intends to reject the bid. If after the first invitation of bids, all bids are rejected, the city shall reevaluate its cost estimates of the project and either:

a. Abandon the project or readvertise for bids in the manner described by this section; or

b. May have the project completed by force account without further complying with this section, if it passes a resolution by a four-fifths vote of the city council declaring that the project can be performed more economically by the employees of the city.

7. Performance Bonds. The department head shall have authority to require a performance bond before entering a contract in such amount as he or she finds reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the city. If the city manager requires a performance bond, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids. (Ord. 770, § 1).

2.20.070 Encumbrance of funds.
Except in cases of emergency purchases, the city manager shall not issue any purchase order for supplies, equipment, nonprofessional services or services involving unique ability for which there is an insufficient appropriation in the budgetary account against which said purchase is to be charged. (Ord. 566, § 1, Amended by Ord. 770, § 1; 1976 Code § 2-4.09. Formerly 2.20.090).

2.20.080 Inspection and testing of materials and services.
The ordering department shall inspect supplies and equipment delivered, and determine their conformance with the specifications set forth in the order or contract. The city manager shall have authority to require chemical and physical tests of samples submitted with bids, and samples of deliveries which are necessary to determine their quality and conformance with specifications. (Ord. 566, § 1, Amended by Ord. 770, § 1; 1976 Code § 2-4.11. Formerly 2.20.110).

2.20.090 Change orders.
Following the award of a contract for materials, supplies, equipment, services, public projects or maintenance work pursuant to this chapter, the contract may be amended by the issuance of a change order, provided the change which is the subject of amendment is reasonably related to the scope of the original contract. The city manager or designee will maintain control relative to the scoping, estimating and negotiating of the proposed change(s) and the finance director will certify the availability of funds for the proposed change in the event that the change order increases the contract cost. The total contract budget may include a council-authorized contract contingency. Any change order that exceeds the authority limits granted herein shall be submitted to the city council for approval. (Ord. 566, § 1, Amended by Ord. 728, § 1; Ord. 770, § 1; 1976 Code § 2-4.12. Formerly 2.20.120).

2.20.100 Surplus supplies and equipment.
All using departments shall submit to the city manager, at such times and in such forms as shall be prescribed, reports showing all supplies and equipment which are no longer used or which have become obsolete or worn out. The city manager shall have authority to sell by auction, advertisement for sealed bids or negotiation all supplies and equipment which cannot be used by any department, or which have become unsuitable for city use. The city manager shall also have authority to exchange or trade the same for new supplies and equipment. The city manager shall also have the authority to make transfers between departments of any usable surplus supplies or equipment. (Ord. 566, § 1, Amended by Ord. 770, § 1; 1976 Code § 2-4.13. Formerly 2.20.130).

2.20.110 Splitting orders to avoid competitive bidding prohibited.
It is unlawful to split or separate into smaller orders the purchase of supplies, materials, equipment or services for the purpose of evading the competitive bidding provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 566, § 1, Amended by Ord. 770, § 1; 1976 Code § 2-4.14. Formerly 2.20.140).

2.20.120 Cooperative purchasing agreements with other agencies.
To foster greater economy and efficiency, the city may avail itself of state and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services. Joint procurements, state cooperative purchasing programs, and assignment of existing contract rights (“piggyback” procurements) with other public agencies may be used when consistent with applicable state and federal statutory or grant requirements. The city manager is empowered and authorized to act under the provisions of this chapter to procure for the city supplies, equipment, and services in conjunction with such voluntary cooperative purchasing agreements or programs which may be available and advantageous to the city. (Ord. 566, § 1, Amended by Ord. 770, § 1; 1976 Code § 2-4.15. Formerly 2.20.150).

2.20.130 Exceptions to formal contracting procedures.
A. Sole and Single (Noncompetitive) Source. Regardless of the estimated cost of the procurement, when permissible under applicable law, the city is not required to engage in the competitive bidding process when procuring materials, equipment, supplies or services for which there exists only a sole source of supply or when other factors, including financial, schedule, or performance requirements, make the use of competitive procurement procedures unavailing.

B. Emergency Procedures. In accordance with Public Contract Code Sections 20168 and 22050, in the case of an emergency, the city manager may repair or replace a public facility, take any directly related and immediate action required by that emergency, and procure the necessary equipment, services, and supplies for those purposes without giving notice for bids to let contracts. “Emergency,” as used in this chapter and as defined by Public Contract Code Section 1102, means a sudden, unexpected occurrence that poses a clear and imminent danger, requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property, or essential public services.

The city manager must report the emergency action to the city council no later than seven days after the action, or at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting, provided it is no later than fourteen days after the emergency action was taken. The city manager’s report must explain why the action was necessary to respond to the emergency and why the emergency did not permit a delay resulting from a competitive solicitation for bids. The city council shall review the emergency action and determine by a four-fifths vote where such emergency action is still needed.

C. Discretion to Waive Competitive Process. The city council, or the city manager for procurements within his/her procurement authority, may waive the requirements for formal competitive bidding or other procedures set forth in this chapter, when permissible under applicable law, when a determination is made that the best interests of the city are served thereby, and provided there is adequate documentation of the need for the procurement. These circumstances shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the findings justifying the waiver must be documented in the record. (Ord. 770, § 1).

2.20.140 Revenue-generating contracts/concessions.
To the extent they are not otherwise governed by city policies, concession agreements are contracts where the city grants permission to use city facilities or property to vendors to sell products or services, for which the city receives a percentage of the proceeds and/or a flat rate of compensation. Generally, these arrangements are at no direct cost to the city.

Where it is determined that a number of potential vendors are available to provide similar products or services, a competitive negotiations procedure should be followed, and the city manager may award a contract to the highest ranked proposer, taking into consideration the economic return to the city, quality of the product, service and experience of the vendor.

The city council shall approve revenue-generating concessions/contracts that exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars in value. (Ord. 770, § 1).

3.15.010 Authority.
This chapter shall be known as the “Parking Tax Ordinance of the City of Millbrae.” (Ord. 702, § 1)

3.15.020 Purpose.
The parking tax required by this chapter is imposed through the taxing power of the city solely for the purpose of generating revenue to be placed in the general fund to support general municipal services and functions. Payment of the tax does not release or in any way excuse a person from compliance with other applicable provisions of this code or other laws, including any permit or license requirement. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.030 Definitions.
A.    “Effective date” means November 9, 2005, on which date the ordinance codified in this chapter will go into effect if it has received a majority vote approval in the general municipal election on November 8, 2005.

B.    “Occupant” means a person who, for consideration, uses, possesses or has the right to use or possess any space for the parking or storage of motor vehicles, motorcycles, or other similar means of conveyance in a parking facility.

C.    “Parking facility” means any privately owned operation located off of the street in the city of Millbrae with the purpose of providing, for any form of consideration, parking or storage of motor vehicles, motorcycles or other similar means of conveyance.

D.    “Parking facility operator” means the person who is the proprietor of the parking facility, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity, including but not limited to a receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a trustee in bankruptcy. Where a parking facility operator performs functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed a parking facility operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his/her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

E.    “Parking fee” means the consideration received for the parking or storage of motor vehicles, motorcycles, or other similar means of conveyance, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. “Parking fee” includes the total charges required to be paid by an occupant (including, but not limited to, a valet or service labor charge) in connection with the use or occupancy of parking space.

F.    “Parking tax” means the tax imposed by this chapter.

G.    “Tax administrator” means the city manager or designee. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.040 Parking facility tax imposed.
For the privilege of parking at a parking facility, each occupant is subject to and shall pay a parking tax in the amount of ten percent of the parking fee charged by a parking facility operator commencing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Where the parking fee is paid, charged or billed, or falls due on either an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or other term basis, the parking fee so paid, charged, billed, or fallen due shall be subject to the tax herein imposed.

The parking tax constitutes a debt owed to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the parking facility operator or to the city. Each occupant shall pay the tax to the parking facility operator at the time the parking fee is paid. If the parking fee is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the parking facility operator, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.050 Exemption.
No parking tax shall be imposed on any occupant who is a registered guest in a hotel as defined in MMC 3.30.020(B) for the parking or storage of a motor vehicle on or off hotel premises if no charge is made to the occupant or if such charge is added to the room bill of the occupant and paid by him to the hotel; provided, that proper records are maintained by both the hotel operator and the parking facility operator which accurately reflect such exempt parking activity. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.060 Parking facility operator’s duties.
Each parking facility operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the parking fee is collected. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the parking fee charged, and each customer shall receive a receipt for payment from the parking facility operator.

No parking facility operator shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the parking facility operator, or that it will not be added to the parking fee, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.070 Registration.
Within ten days after commencing business or the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, each parking facility operator shall register said parking facility with the tax administrator and obtain from the tax administrator a “parking facility registration certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall state the name of the parking facility operator, the address of the parking facility, the date upon which the certificate was issued, and such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as the tax administrator may require. The parking facility registration certificate shall be signed by the owner if a natural person; in the case of an association or partnership, by a member or partner; in the case of a corporation, by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the parking facility registration certificate. The tax administrator shall within thirty days after such registration issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from the occupant, together with a duplicate certificate and the duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable. Such certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the tax administrator upon cessation of business at the location named or upon its sale or transfer. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.080 Reporting and remitting.
A.    Every parking facility operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, tender a return to the tax administrator comprised of an accounting of the total parking fees charged and received together with the amount of parking taxes collected during the preceding quarter. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the parking taxes shall be remitted to the city.

B.    Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business of the parking facility for any reason. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.090 Penalties and interest.
A.    Original Delinquency. Any parking facility operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the parking taxes due in addition to the amount of said taxes due.

B.    Continued Delinquency. Any parking facility operator who fails to remit any delinquency remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the parking taxes due in addition to the amount of said taxes due and the ten percent penalty first imposed.

C.    Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (A) and (B) of this section.

D.    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any parking facility operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the parking taxes due, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E.    Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the parking taxes required to be paid in this chapter. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.100 Failure to collect and report tax – Determination of parking tax due.
If any parking facility operator fails or refuses to collect the parking taxes and to submit to city, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said taxes or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as the tax administrator may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the taxes due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any parking facility operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the tax administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such parking facility operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the parking facility operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such parking facility operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the parking facility operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the parking facility operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the parking facility operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the parking facility operator in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in MMC 3.15.110. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.110 Appeal.
Any parking facility operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such parking facility operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.120 Records – Audit.
It shall be the duty of every parking facility operator liable for collection and payment to the city of any parking taxes imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such taxes for which the parking facility operator may have been liable to collect and remit to the city. The tax administrator shall have the right to inspect such records at all reasonable times. The tax administrator also shall have the right to audit the records of a parking facility operator at all reasonable times. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.130 Tax refund.
A.    Whenever the amount of any parking taxes, interest or penalties has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections (B) and (C) of this section, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

B.    A parking facility operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not an occupant; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the occupant or credited to parking fees subsequently payable by the occupant to the parking facility operator.

C.    An occupant may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided by subsection (A) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the occupant directly to the tax administrator, or when the occupant having paid the tax to the parking facility operator establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the occupant has been unable to obtain a refund from the parking facility operator who collected the tax and who actually remitted the amount of tax collected to the city.

D.    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right to such a refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.140 Action to collect.
Any tax required to be paid by any occupant under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the occupant to the city. Any such tax collected by a parking facility operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the parking facility operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable therefor in any action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 702, § 1).

3.15.150 Prohibited acts.
A.    Any parking facility operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required in this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a violation of this code.

B.    Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a violation of this code. (Ord. 702, § 1).

This chapter shall be known as the “Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance of the City of Millbrae.” (Ord. 234, § 1; 1976 Code § 3-6.01; 1966 Code § 5375).

3.30.020 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:

A.    Except as used in subsection (D) of this section, “person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

B.    “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

C.    “Occupancy” means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portions thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

D.    “Transient” means any individual who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy of a specific room by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing providing for a longer period of occupancy of the room. In determining whether an individual is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered.

E.    “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

F.    “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity, including but not limited to a receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a trustee in bankruptcy. Where an operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

G.    “Tax administrator” means the city manager.

H.    “Hosting platform” means a means or facility through which an operator may offer a short-term residential rental unit, or portion thereof, for occupancy by a transient. A hosting platform includes, but is not limited to, an Internet-based platform that allows an operator to advertise and arrange for occupancy of a commercial lodging or short-term residential rental by a transient, whether the transient pays rent directly to the operator or to the hosting platform. (Ord. 234, § 1, Amended by Ord. 333, § 1; Ord. 397, § 1; Ord. 425, § 1; Ord. 698, § 1 and Ord. 771 § 1(A); 1976 Code § 3-6.02; 1966 Code § 5376).

3.30.030 Tax imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator, commencing on January 1, 2010. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord. 234, § 1, Amended by Ord. 279, § 1; Ord. 333, § 2; Ord. 404, § 1; Ord. 486, § 1, Ord. 573, § 1 and Ord. 725, § 1; 1976 Code § 3-6.03; 1966 Code § 5377).

3.30.040 Exemptions.
A.    No tax shall be imposed upon:

1.    Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided in this chapter;

2.    Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business;

3.    Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty;

B.    No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. (Ord. 234, § 1; 1976 Code § 3-6.04; 1966 Code § 5378).

3.30.050 Operator’s duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Ord. 234, § 1; 1976 Code § 3-6.05; 1966 Code § 5379).

3.30.060 Registration.
Within ten days after commencing business, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a “Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. An application for a Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate must include whether the operator intends to collect and remit transient occupancy tax through a hosting platform, and the identity of any hosting platform the operator intends to use.

Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A.    The name of the operator;

B.    The address of the hotel;

C.    The date upon which the certificate was issued;

D.    The following statement: “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Ord. 234, § 1, Amended by Ord. 333, § 3 and Ord. 771, § 1(B); 1976 Code § 3-6.06; 1966 Code § 5380).

3.30.070 Reporting and remitting.
A.    Each operator shall on or before the tenth day of each month, or at the close of any shorter reporting period, or longer reporting period, which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received, the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies during the preceding calendar month, the amount of tax collected on the operator’s behalf by a hosting platform, the identity of the hosting platform that has participated in each transaction, the total number of rooms available, and the number of rooms rented.

B.    The tax administrator may, but he is not required to, establish longer reporting periods for any operator if he deems it necessary by reason of the internal accounting and accounts payable system of that operator.

C.    Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.

D.    All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city and shall be promptly deposited in a separate account maintained in the name of the operator as trustee in a commercial bank or other financial institution, until payment hereof is made to the tax administrator. Each operator shall notify the city of the name and address of the commercial bank or financial institution with whom the trustee account is maintained. (Ord. 234, § 1, Amended by Ord. 333, § 4; Ord. 336, § 1; Ord. 397, §§ 2, 3 and Ord. 771, § 1(C); 1976 Code § 3-6.07; 1966 Code § 5381).

3.30.075 Collecting and remitting by hosting platforms.
Any hosting platform may enter into an agreement with the city for the collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes on behalf of operators. Where a hosting platform has entered into such an agreement, the hosting platform has the same duties and liabilities of the operator under this chapter relating to collection and remission of transient occupancy taxes. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the operator or the hosting platform is considered to be compliance by both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, agreements for collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes by hosting platforms do not relieve operators of other requirements imposed by this chapter beyond the scope of the agreement, including, without limitation, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Each hosting platform collecting rent or transient occupancy tax for hotels in the city must register in its own name and post its Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate on its website, if applicable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax administrator, at his or her sole discretion, may require a hosting platform that collects payment of rent on behalf of an operator of a hotel in the city to comply with MMC 3.30.050 and 3.30.070 on behalf of the operator without an agreement. (Ord. 771, § 1(D)).

3.30.080 Penalties and interest.
A.    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

B.    Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquency remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed.

C.    Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (A) and (B) of this section.

D.    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E.    Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid in this chapter. (Ord. 234, § 1; 1976 Code § 3-6.09; 1966 Code § 5382).

3.30.090 Failure to collect and report tax – Determination of tax by tax administrator.
If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in MMC 3.30.100. (Ord. 234, § 1; 1976 Code § 3-6.10; 1966 Code § 5383).

3.30.100 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 234, § 1; 1976 Code § 3-6.11; 1966 Code § 5384).

3.30.110 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and such payment to the city which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

The tax administrator also may have audited the records of an operator concerning whom a question has arisen relating to the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter. The audit shall be conducted by a certified public accountant selected by the tax administrator. The cost of the audit shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city; provided, however, that no audit of the records of a particular operator shall be made at the expense of that operator more frequently than once every other fiscal year of the city. (Ord. 234, § 1, Amended by Ord. 397, § 4; 1976 Code § 3-6.12; 1966 Code § 5385).

Article VI. Responsibility

4.65.270 Reporting unauthorized discharge.
A.    Liquids and Solids at STP. As soon as any person in charge of a storage facility or responsible for emergency response for a facility has knowledge of any confirmed or unconfirmed unauthorized discharge of a hazardous material which is liquid or solid at STP, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery and containment and cleanup of such discharge and shall notify the officer of the occurrence as required by this subsection.

1.    Confirmed Unauthorized Discharge.

a.    Recordable Unauthorized Discharge. Any recordable unauthorized discharge shall be contained and safely disposed of in an appropriate manner by permittee and such occurrence and the response thereto shall be recorded in the permittee’s monitoring records. A recordable unauthorized discharge is any unauthorized discharge of a hazardous material which meets all of the following criteria:

i.    The discharge is from a primary containment to a secondary containment or to a rigid aboveground surface covering capable of containing the discharge until cleanup of the hazardous material is completed; and

ii.    The permittee is able to adequately clean up the discharge before it escapes from such secondary containment or such aboveground surface, but if the cleanup requires more than eight hours, it becomes a reportable discharge in accordance with this chapter.

iii.    There is no increase in the hazard of fire or explosion, nor is there any production of a flammable or poisonous gas, nor is there any deterioration of such secondary containment or such rigid aboveground surface.

iv.    An otherwise recordable unauthorized discharge does not need to be recorded if the discharge is not the result of the deterioration or failure of the primary container and the quantity discharged is less than one ounce by weight, and can be cleaned up within fifteen minutes.

b.    Reportable Unauthorized Discharge. Any unauthorized discharge which is not determined to be recordable under this chapter must be reported to the officer immediately. The reporting party shall provide information to the officer relating to the ability of permittee to contain and dispose of the hazardous material, the estimated time it will take to complete containment and disposal, and the degree of hazard created. The officer may verify that the hazardous material is being contained and appropriately disposed. The officer at any time upon a determination that permittee is not adequately containing and disposing of such hazardous material, shall have the power and authority to undertake and direct an emergency response in order to protect the public health and/or safety.

2.    Unconfirmed Unauthorized Discharge.

a.    Indication of Loss in Inventory Records. Whenever a material balance or other inventory record, employed as a monitoring technique under the HMMP, indicates a loss of hazardous material, and no unauthorized discharge has been confirmed by other means, permittee shall have five working days to determine whether or not there has been an unauthorized discharge. If before the end of such period, it is determined that there has been no unauthorized discharge, an entry explaining the occurrence shall be made in permittee’s monitoring records. Where permittee has not been able, within such period, to determine that there has been no unauthorized discharge, an unauthorized discharge is deemed confirmed and permittee shall proceed in accordance with subsection (A) of this section.

b.    Test Results. Whenever any test results suggest a possible unauthorized discharge, and no unauthorized discharge has been confirmed by other means, the permittee shall have five working days to retest. If second test results obtained within that period establish that there has been no unauthorized discharge, the results of both tests shall be recorded in permittee’s monitoring records. If it has not been established within such period that there has been no unauthorized discharge, an unauthorized discharge is deemed confirmed and permittee shall proceed in accordance with subsection (A) of this section.

B.    Gases at STP. Any person in charge of a storage facility or responsible for emergency response for a storage facility, who has knowledge of any unauthorized discharge of a hazardous material which is a gas at STP, must immediately report such discharge to the city if such discharge presents a threat of imminent danger to public health and safety.

C.    Office of Emergency Services. The city shall submit a written report to the Office of Emergency Services within ten working days from the date that the city is notified of an unauthorized discharge from an underground storage tank. (Ord. 476, § 2, Amended by Ord. 480, § 5; 1976 Code § 4-13.601).

4.65.280 Cleanup responsibility.
Any person, firm or corporation responsible for storing the hazardous material shall institute and complete all actions necessary to remedy the effects of any unauthorized discharge, whether sudden or gradual. The officer shall undertake actions to remedy the effects of such unauthorized discharge itself, only if it determines that it is reasonably necessary under the circumstances for the officer to do so. The responsible party shall be liable to reimburse the officer for all costs incurred by the officer in remedying the effects of such unauthorized discharge, including the costs of fighting fires to the extent allowed by law. This responsibility is not conditioned upon evidence of wilfulness or negligence of the party storing the hazardous material(s) in causing or allowing such discharge. Any responsible party who undertakes action to remedy the effects of unauthorized discharge(s) shall not be barred by this chapter from seeking to recover appropriate costs and expenditures from other responsible parties except as provided by MMC 4.65.290. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.602).

4.65.290 Indemnification.
The permittee shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the officer and the city against any claim, cause of action, disability, loss, liability, damage, cost or expense, howsoever arising, which occurs by reason of an unauthorized discharge in connection with permittee’s operations under this permit, except as arises from the officer’s sole wilful act or sole active negligence. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.603).

Article VII. Inspections and Records

Permittees are not required to disclose the identity of hazardous materials protected as trade secrets pursuant to MMC 4.65.260 to anyone other than the official designated for that purpose pursuant to MMC 4.65.260 except in the case of an emergency response or an unauthorized discharge related to the storage facility in which the trade secret material is contained. Therefore, permittee may put temporary coverings over the labels of trade secret materials during the course of inspections conducted by other than the officer so designated.

A.    Right of Entry. Whenever necessary for the purpose of investigating or enforcing the provisions of this chapter, or whenever any enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises, any condition which constitutes a violation of this chapter, said officers may enter such structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same, or to perform any duty imposed upon any of said respective officers by law; provided that if such structure or premises be occupied, the officer shall first present proper credentials and request entry, and further provided, that if such structure or premises is unoccupied, the officer shall first make a reasonable attempt to contact a responsible person from such firm or corporation and request entry, except in emergency circumstances. If such entry is refused, the officer seeking entry shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.

B.    Inspections by Officer Discretionary. All inspections specified herein shall be at the discretion of the officer and nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the officer to conduct any such inspection nor shall any actual inspection made imply a duty to conduct any other inspection. Furthermore, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to hold the officer or any officer, employee or representative of the city responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of making an inadequate or negligent inspection or by reason of any failure to make an inspection or reinspection. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.701).

A.    The special inspector shall be a qualified person or firm who shall demonstrate expertise to the satisfaction of the officer.

B.    The special inspection report shall include an evaluation of the facilities and recommendations consistent with the provisions of this chapter where appropriate. A copy of the report shall be filed with the officer at the same time that it is submitted to permittee.

C.    Permittee shall, within thirty days of said report, file with the officer a plan to implement all recommendations, or shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the officer why such recommendations shall not be implemented. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.703).

4.65.330 Substituted inspections.
An inspection by an employee of any other public agency may be deemed by the officer as a substitute for any requirement above. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.704).

4.65.340 Maintenance of records.
All records required by this chapter shall be maintained by the permittee for a period of not less than three years. Said records shall be made available to the officer during normal working hours and upon reasonable notice. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.705).

Article VIII. Application for Permit

4.65.350 Permit.
Any permit, firm, or corporation which stores any hazardous material shall obtain and keep current a hazardous materials storage permit issued pursuant to this chapter. One such permit shall be issued for a single facility. Additional approvals shall be obtained for any storage facility thereafter connected, installed, constructed, repaired as required by MMC 4.65.140, substantially modified, replaced, closed or removed, or for any change or addition in hazardous materials stored, not in accordance with the prior approval. Notwithstanding the above, permittee shall have thirty days to apply for an additional approval for the storing of a new or different hazardous material with the same hazard class as stated on the existing permit approvals where such storage does not increase the hazard of fire or explosion or the hazard of the production of flammable or poisonous gas.

4.65.690 Disclaimer of liability.
A.    The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. The standards set forth herein are minimal standards and this chapter does not imply that compliance will ensure that there will be no unauthorized discharge of hazardous material. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof or the officer, respectively, for any damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. All persons handling, storing, using, processing, and disposing of hazardous materials within the city should be and are advised to determine to their own satisfaction the level of protection in addition to that required by this chapter necessary or desirable to ensure that there is no unauthorized discharge of hazardous materials.

B.    This chapter is not intended to create any different standard or obligation for the storage of carcinogens than is imposed for the storage of other hazardous materials. Hazardous materials are identified as carcinogens herein for public record purposes only and the identification of a material as a carcinogen shall not require a different or stricter application of the provisions of this chapter, nor notice to any person under any circumstances other than those expressly specified in this chapter, nor shall such identification create any other duty or obligation upon the officer different from or additional to those duties or obligations applicable to the storage of other hazardous materials. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.1301).

4.65.700 Guidelines.

4.65.710 Duties are discretionary.
Subject to the limitations of due process, notwithstanding any other provision of this code whenever the words “shall” or “must” are used in establishing a responsibility or duty of the officer, its elected or appointed officers, employees, or agents, it is the legislative intent that such words establish a discretionary responsibility or duty requiring the exercise of judgment and discretion. (Ord. 476, § 2; 1976 Code § 4-13.1303).

4.65.720 Conflict with other laws.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter:

A.    A storage facility regulated by any state or federal agency will be exempted from any conflicting provision of this chapter.

The city council declares that it would have passed this chapter and each and every section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase not declared invalid or unconstitutional without regard to whether any portion of the chapter would be subsequently declared invalid or unconstitutional.

If any word or phrase used in this chapter is not defined in this section, it shall have the meanings set forth in the California Vehicle Code; provided, however, that if any such word or phrase is not defined in the Vehicle Code, it shall have the meaning attributed to it in ordinary usage.

4.70.020 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for terminal designation and truck route designation to terminals for interstate trucks operating on a federally designated highway system and to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the public. (Ord. 490, § 1; 1976 Code § 4-14.02).

4.70.030 Application.
A.    Any interested person requiring terminal access from the federally designated highway system shall submit an application, on a form as provided by the city, together with such information as may be required by the transportation engineer and shall pay appropriate fees to the city of Millbrae.

B.    Upon receipt of the application, the transportation engineer will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal facility meets the requirements for an interstate truck terminal. Upon his approval of that designation, he will then determine the capability of the route requested and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination of route capability will include, without limitation, a review of adequate turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections and highways and general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed and traffic volumes. No access off a federally designated highway system will be approved without the approval of Caltrans.

C.    Should the requested route pass through the city of Millbrae to a terminal located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall comply with that jurisdiction’s application process. Coordination of the approval of the route through the city will be the responsibility of the entity which controls the terminal’s land use. (Ord. 490, § 1; 1976 Code § 4-14.03).

4.70.040 Fees and costs.
A.    The applicant shall pay a nonrefundable application fee, as established by the city by resolution, sufficient to pay the cost of the review of the terminal designation and the review of the route and alternate route.

B.    Upon the approval of the terminal designation and route by the city and by Caltrans the applicant shall deposit with the city of Millbrae sufficient funds as estimated by the transportation engineer to pay for the purchase and installation of terminal trailblazer signs. Trailblazer signs will be required at every decision point in the city en route to the terminal. Upon completion of the installation of the signs, the actual cost shall be computed and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required are in place. (Ord. 490, § 1; 1976 Code § 4-14.04).

4.70.050 Retrofitting.
A.    If all feasible routes to a requested terminal are found unsatisfactory by the transportation engineer, the applicant may request retrofitting the deficiencies. All costs of engineering, construction and inspection will be the responsibility of the applicant. Except when the retrofitting of deficiencies is within the jurisdiction of Caltrans, the actual construction will be done by the city or by a contractor acceptable to it.

B.    When the work is to be done by the city, the applicant shall deposit with the city of Millbrae the estimated cost of retrofitting. Adjustments between the estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the work and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant as the case may be. When the work is done by the applicant, the applicant may file with the transportation engineer, on a form satisfactory to the transportation engineer, a statement detailing the actual costs of the retrofitting.

C.    If at any time within five years from the date of completion of the retrofitting by the applicant, should any other applicant seek terminal approval which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, any such applicant’s fee may include that applicant’s proportionate share of the retrofitting, as determined by the transportation engineer, which fee shall be disbursed by the city of Millbrae to the original applicant who paid for the retrofitting as well as to any other applicant who contributed to the cost of retrofitting under this subsection. Nothing herein shall require the payment of a proportionate fee if the applicant doing the work failed to file the report with the transportation engineer required by subsection (B) of this section. (Ord. 490, § 1; 1976 Code § 4-14.05).

4.70.060 Revocation of route.
The transportation engineer may revoke any approved terminal or route if the terminal or route becomes a traffic hazard for vehicular traffic. A safety hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate the route or said vehicles causing unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic or pedestrians. (Ord. 490, § 1; 1976 Code § 4-14.06).

4.70.070 Appeal process.
A.    If the transportation engineer denies terminal designation, route feasibility or revokes a previously approved terminal or route, the applicant or terminal owner, within ten days following the date of receipt of the decision of the transportation engineer may appeal said decision to the city council in writing. An appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the department of public works and shall be filed with the city clerk. The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or abuse of discretion by the transportation engineer or wherein its decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. Within five days of the filing of an appeal, the transportation engineer shall transmit to the city clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route and all other data filed therewith, the report of the transportation engineer, the findings of the transportation engineer and his decision on the application.

B.    The city clerk shall make copies of the data provided by the transportation engineer available to the applicant and to the appellant (if the applicant is not the appellant) for inspection and may give notice to any other interested party who requested notice of the time when the appeal will be considered by the city council as provided in subsection (C) of this section.

C.    The city council shall hear and determine the appeal at its second regularly scheduled meeting following the date upon which the appeal of an applicant or terminal owner is filed with the city clerk.

D.    If Caltrans and not the transportation engineer denies or revokes terminal access from federally designated highways, no appeal may be made to the city council, but must be made to Caltrans as may be permitted by Caltrans. (Ord. 490, § 1; 1976 Code § 4-14.07).

K.    “Residential parking permit” means a permit issued to a resident pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 703, § 1).

4.80.020 Purpose.
This chapter is intended to ameliorate the serious adverse effects caused in certain areas and neighborhoods of the city by motor vehicle congestion, particularly the long-term parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas and neighborhoods by nonresidents who conduct business in the city. Such parking by nonresidents threatens the health, safety and welfare of the residents and commerce of the city. In order to protect such residents and owners and to promote commercial well-being in impacted neighborhoods and commercial areas, it is necessary to enact the preferential parking system established by this chapter. (Ord. 703, § 1).

4.80.030 Findings.
The preferential parking system established by this chapter will help achieve the following benefits:

A.    Reduce potential hazardous traffic conditions resulting from the long-term parking of commuter motor vehicles in residential neighborhoods;

B.    Protect such areas and neighborhoods from polluted air, excessive noise, and trash and refuse caused by the entry and exit of non-local motor vehicles;

C.    Protect the residents of such areas and neighborhoods from unreasonable burdens in obtaining parking near their residences and in gaining access to their residences;

D.    Preserve the character of such areas and neighborhoods as residential;

E.    Promote efficient maintenance of the streets of such areas and neighborhoods in a clean and safe condition;

F.    Preserve the value of property in such areas and neighborhoods;

G.    Promote and protect commercial enterprises by elimination of commuter parking in impacted commercial areas, provision of free short-term parking for customers, and provision of preferential parking permits to employees of commercial establishments;

H.    Preserve the safety of children and other pedestrians;

I.    Promote traffic safety and the peace, good order, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city;

J.    Provide preferential parking permits for business owners and employees on the perimeter of the commercial areas, thereby freeing core commercial spaces for customers; and

K.    Establish an equitable system for the use of parking spaces where the city’s commercial areas border adjacent residential areas. (Ord. 703, § 1).

4.80.040 Parking permit privilege.
A motor vehicle displaying a valid residential parking permit as provided for herein shall be permitted to stand or be parked in the residential parking permit areas for which the permit has been issued without being limited by posted time restrictions. A motor vehicle displaying a valid local business parking permit as provided for herein shall be permitted to stand or be parked in the designated business parking permit area for which the permit has been issued without being limited by posted time restrictions. Any vehicle which does not display a valid parking permit shall be subject to posted parking restrictions and consequent penalties in effect for such parking areas. No residential or local business parking permit shall guarantee or reserve to the holder thereof an on-street parking space within the designated residential or business parking permit area. (Ord. 703, § 1).

4.80.050 Authority to designate residential and business parking areas.
The boundaries within which preferential parking areas may be designated will be approved, altered or dissolved by city council resolution. The director of public works or his/her designated representative is authorized to designate the precise parking permit areas within city council approved boundaries which meet the requirements of this chapter. Such parking permit areas shall be established when unrestricted parking (1) creates an imbalance between commercial and residential parking that substantially and unreasonably interferes with the equitable use of parking by residents and businesses intended for a particular area or (2) becomes the source of excessive noise, traffic hazards, environmental pollution or of other interference within the residential and commercial environments, and detrimentally affects the public welfare. (Ord. 703, § 1).

4.80.060 Application for residential parking permit areas.
Residents who desire the city to establish a parking permit area may submit a preferential parking petition to the director of public works which meets and satisfies the following requirements:

A.    Prior to obtaining signatures, neighborhood organizers shall consult with city staff to assure that the proposed new permitted parking area falls within the designated boundaries of the city’s current preferential parking areas.

B.    The petition shall contain a description or a map showing the proposed residential parking permit area.

C.    Said description or map shall be followed in the petition by a statement describing the residential parking permit program and the current residential permit fees.

D.    The statement shall be followed by a signature, printed name, address, and date of signing of the application by seventy-five percent of the households within the potential parking permit area who agree to and would approve the implementation of permit parking on their street.

E.    All petitions shall be the same as the standard petition form developed by city staff. Any petition form different from the standard petition form shall be deemed invalid for the purposes of this chapter.

F.    In the proposed residential parking permit area at least eighty percent of the block fronts with unlimited on-street parking must be residentially zoned, and at a minimum, seventy-five percent of all unlimited on-street parking spaces within the proposed area must be occupied during any two one-hour periods between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (Ord. 703, § 1).

4.80.070 Creation of business parking permit areas.
Designation of new business parking permit area boundaries may require the modification or elimination of residential parking permit areas. Any such modifications must be approved by the city council by resolution. If a business or businesses desire to expand or modify the business preferential parking areas approved by council resolution, they may submit a letter request to the director of public works. This request will be forwarded to the downtown process committee for review and assessment of impacts on other business preferential parking areas as well as on residential preferential parking areas. The downtown process committee’s recommendation on whether to add new or modify existing business permit parking areas will be forwarded to the director of public works. The director of public works will present the downtown process committee’s recommendations, together with staff’s recommendations, to council for determination. (Ord. 703, § 1).

4.80.080 Issuance of residential and business parking permits.
Preferential parking residential and business permits shall be issued by the chief of police or designated representative. Permits may be issued to an owner or resident of property within a residential parking permit area and to owners or employees of businesses within a business parking permit area. The preferential parking permits shall only be issued to persons living or working within the preferential permit area who have a motor vehicle currently registered in their name, or who have lawful possession of a motor vehicle for their exclusive use and/or which is under their control. Permits shall be issued only upon application of a resident or business and upon payment of any applicable fees. Each application and reapplication shall be on a form provided by the chief of police.

4.85.010 Findings.
The council of the city finds and determines that:

A.    There has been a significant increase in traffic in this general region and in this city, and this trend is anticipated to continue in the future.

B.    Recent and future development and redevelopment within the city and in the surrounding area will lead to increased traffic in the area.

C.    Transportation system management (TSM) programs have been shown to be capable of reducing vehicle trips and increasing vehicle occupancy rates, and can be effective in reducing the need for costly major road improvements.

D.    Decreasing the number of vehicular trips and miles, especially on the regional road network, both absolutely and within peak traffic periods, will help alleviate traffic congestion, energy consumption and noise levels and will help to improve and maintain air quality. These improvements will contribute to making the city an attractive and convenient place to live, work, visit and do business, and will help employers recruit and retain a qualified work force.

E.    Cooperation with and coordination of TSM programs with nearby cities and other local agencies with transportation roles will assist the city in meeting the goals and objectives of this chapter.

F.    Adoption of the TSM ordinance codified in this chapter is one component of implementing a comprehensive approach to reducing traffic problems that should be supported by complementary land use policies and transportation and transit improvements.

G.    Adoption of the TSM ordinance codified in this chapter will (1) promote public health, safety and economic vitality; (2) mitigate the effects of traffic congestion including associated noise and air quality impacts on the environment; and (3) enhance the general welfare, both within the city and region.

H.    The goals and objectives of this chapter are consistent with the city’s general plan.

I.    Participation of private and public employers, sponsors, employer organizations, and employee organizations is critical to the successful implementation of this chapter.

J.    In adopting the ordinance codified in this chapter, it is the intention of the city council that employers and sponsors who act diligently and in good faith to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not be penalized for lack of participation of employees or tenants in commute alternatives, and shall not be held accountable for the achievement of a participation rate by employees or tenants.

K.    This chapter will implement provisions of that certain “Joint Powers Agreement Establishing the Multi-City Transportation System Management (TSM) Agency,” a joint exercise of powers agreement entered pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 6500 et seq., of which agency this city is a member.

L.    Since the Bay Area Air Quality Management District’s (BAAQMD) Regulation 13, Rule 1 is the current trip reduction regulation with which our employer base must comply and the jurisdictions within the county of San Mateo did not elect to accept delegation of the Rule, the provisions in this chapter are intended to assist employers in the region in achieving their trip reduction goals to improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion.

5.60.010 Purpose and intent.
A.    In enacting this chapter, the city council recognizes that commercial massage therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer the public valuable health and therapeutic services. The city council further recognizes that, unless properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses.

B.    Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to address the negative impacts identified in the city council’s findings to reduce or prevent neighborhood blight and to protect and preserve the quality of city neighborhoods and commercial districts; and to enhance enforcement of criminal statutes relating to the conduct of operators and employees of massage businesses.

C.    It is the council’s further purpose and intent to rely upon the uniform statewide regulations applicable to massage practitioners and establishments that were enacted by the State Legislature in 2008 as Business and Professions Code Section 4600 et seq. by Senate Bill 731, and amended in 2011 by Assembly Bill 619 and in 2014 by Assembly Bill 1147, to restrict the commercial practice of massage in the city to those persons duly certified to practice by the California Massage Therapy Council, and to provide for the registration and regulation of massage businesses for health and safety purposes to the extent allowed by law.

Abandoned shopping carts create potential hazards to the health and safety of the public and interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic within the city. Wrecked, dismantled and abandoned shopping carts on public or private property can create conditions that reduce property values, and promote blight and deterioration in the city. For these reasons, the city finds and determines that abandoned shopping carts constitute a public nuisance.

In order to avoid the creation of such a nuisance, this chapter makes the removal of shopping carts from the premises of a business establishment a violation of this code. In addition, this chapter ensures that storeowners will take action to reduce the removal of shopping carts from a business establishment’s premises and will require the storeowners to aggressively retrieve those shopping carts removed from the business establishment’s premises in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 653, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-13.01).

“Shopping cart” means a basket mounted on wheels which is provided by a business establishment for use by a customer for the purpose of transporting goods of any kind from the business establishment to the customer’s vehicle or other means of transportation on the business establishment’s premises.

(Ord. 653, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-13.12).

5.65.130 Timelines and approval process for shopping cart removal prevention plan.
Every business establishment shall submit a proposed plan for preventing shopping cart removal for approval to the community development department within sixty days after adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter and by July 1st of each year thereafter.

D.    The consortium shall ensure that the city has on file at all times a copy of the current, effective retrieval contract.

Prior history: 1966 Code §§ 5-17.01 – 5-17.11; Ord. 478.

5.85.010 Findings – Purpose.
The city council hereby finds and declares the purposes of this chapter as follows:

A.    There is a substantial governmental interest in promoting the health, safety, welfare and convenience of the public by ensuring that persons may use the public streets, sidewalks, rights-of-way, and other public property without unreasonable interference.

B.    Newsracks placed and maintained on the streets, sidewalks, rights-of-way, or other public property absent some reasonable regulation, may (1) present hazards to persons or property; (2) unreasonably interfere with the use of such public property; and (3) adversely affect the appearance of public property.

C.    The streets, sidewalks, public rights-of-way, and other public property are historically associated with the distribution or sale of newspapers and other publications and the use of newsracks.

D.    It is necessary and desirable for the city to adopt regulations (1) to ensure the safety of the public and its employees, (2) to protect public streets, sidewalks, rights-of-way and other public property, (3) to prevent the unreasonable interference with the use of public property by vehicular, bicycle, wheelchair and pedestrian traffic, (4) to eliminate obstructions of sight distance or views of traffic signs and street crossings, (5) to enhance the aesthetic nature of such public property, while at the same time permitting the use of such public property for the distribution or sale of written material through newsracks to the extent such activity is constitutionally protected and can be carried out without undue interference with the city’s substantial governmental interest of promoting the health, safety, welfare and convenience of the public, and (6) to protect the welfare of minors and prevent minors from having access to materials that are sexually explicit, pornographic and obscene as to them, while at the same time allowing access to such materials to adults.

E.    To that end, the council considers it in the best interest of the public to establish rules and regulations governing the use of public property for the distribution or sale of written materials through newsracks.

F.    The regulation of the distribution or sale of newspapers and other publications through newsracks as set forth in this chapter provides the least intrusive and burdensome means for ensuring the purposes stated in this section are carried out while still providing ample opportunities for the distribution of information to the citizens of the city.

G.    The council determines that more specific location and design standards for newsracks in the redevelopment project areas are required due to the greater frequency of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and newsrack locations in such areas. In addition, the council also finds and declares that the adoption of standard design requirements for newsracks located in the redevelopment project areas complement the revitalization objectives of the redevelopment plan and the downtown action agenda and therefore also promote the public welfare and safety of such area.

H.    The adoption of regulations in this chapter will provide public safety, promote revitalization efforts, protect the aesthetic nature of public property, prevent unreasonable interference with the use of public property by pedestrians and traffic, protect the welfare of minors and establish reasonable rules for the placement and maintenance of newsracks in a manner that provides reasonable accommodation to these competing interests and in a manner consistent with federal and state constitutional requirements. (Ord. 682, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-17.01).

Distributor(s) shall be responsible for providing pedestals and mounting boxes and, where modular newsracks are required, shall coordinate such activities among themselves. Newsracks shall not be chained or otherwise attached to a bus shelter, bench, street light, utility pole, or sign pole, to any other single or modular newsrack, or to any tree, shrub, or other plant, nor situated upon any landscaped area.

3.    Newsracks shall be placed next to each other at a location. In any location where there are more than three non-modular freestanding newsracks used by all distributors at such location, modular style racks shall be required. Except next to buildings, no group of newsracks shall extend for a distance of more than sixteen feet, and shall be no closer than four feet to another group of newsracks. Street furniture such as trash cans, poles and trees (including wells) and utilities such as a fire hydrant shall count as one of the groups of sixteen feet and not as part of the break between groups of newsracks. The number of newsracks that may be placed at any location shall be determined by available space, the application of criteria in this chapter and with sensitivity to the appearance and aesthetic nature of the public forum. The director may designate the limits of areas available for newsracks to ensure that placement adheres to criteria and standards in this chapter.

The number of locations within a given area of the city where newsracks will be permitted shall be designated in accordance with the criteria established in this chapter. Where there are locations already in use by distributors, they shall be used if space is available and new locations not started. No new locations may be established when existing in-use locations provide reasonable access to persons in the area. Any other locations shall be approved by the director.

If sufficient space does not exist to accommodate all newsracks sought to be placed at one location without violating the standards set forth in this chapter, the director shall give priority to new permit applicants as follows:

a.    First priority, on a first come first served basis, shall be given to daily publications (inclusive of their Saturday, Sunday or weekend editions whether or not published jointly with another paper) published at least five times per week;

b.    Second priority, on a first come first served basis, shall be given to publications published more than once but less than five days per week;

c.    Third priority, on a first come first served basis, shall be given to weekly publications;

d.    Fourth priority, on a first come first served basis, shall be given to bi-weekly publications (published less than once per week but more than once per month); and

e.    Fifth priority, on first come first served basis, shall be given to monthly or less frequent publications.

The positioning order of new racks in modular newsracks shall be determined on the same priority basis as above.

4.    Temporary Newsracks. Any single unit newsrack, which meets the requirements of this chapter, may be permitted at a designated location for a period of forty-five days to determine the suitability of long-term newsrack locations. At least ten business days prior to locating a temporary newsrack, a completed permit application shall be submitted, including written notice of the particular location and date upon which the forty-five-day trial period will begin. Within ten business days after expiration of the forty-five-day trial period, the person maintaining the newsrack shall either cause it to be removed or submit a written request to the director for a permit for a permanent newsrack location. Temporary newsracks shall be skirted and weighted down.

5.    No newsrack shall be placed, installed, used or maintained:

a.    Where the newsrack will endanger persons or property.

b.    Where the newsrack will unreasonably interfere with or obstruct the flow of pedestrian, bicycle or vehicular traffic on the public right-of-way.

c.    Where the newsrack unreasonably obstructs or interferes with access to, or the use and enjoyment of, abutting property.

d.    Where the newsrack impedes or interferes with the reasonable use of any commercial window display or any external building display.

e.    Within five feet of any marked crosswalk.

f.    Within fifteen feet of any street intersection as measured from the curb return where there is an unmarked crosswalk.

g.    Within five feet of any curb ramp.

h.    At any location where the clear space for the passage of pedestrians is reduced to less than six feet except that in areas where physical obstructions provide for less than a six foot clearance, a clear space for passage of not less than four feet may be permitted for a distance of not more than ten feet with the written approval of the director.

i.    Within three feet of any fire hydrant, fire call box, police call box, other emergency facility, or traffic signal pole with a pedestrian push button.

j.    Within five feet of any driveway.

(Ord. 682, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-17.07).

5.85.080 Maintenance.
A.    Each newsrack shall be maintained in a safe, neat, painted and clean condition and in working order at all times. For example, without limitation, the newsrack shall be reasonably free of dirt and grease, be reasonably free of chipped, faded, peeling or cracked paint, be reasonably free of rust and corrosion, free from graffiti, have no broken or cracked plastic or glass parts, and have no broken structural parts. Adhesive labels, or attachments, unrelated to publications in the newsracks, other than city issued identification/approval labels, shall not be displayed on newsracks.

D.    Abandoned newsracks may be removed by a designated public works employee and may be disposed of if not claimed by the distributor for the newsracks within ten business days before any newsrack is removed under this subsection. The director shall give written notice to the distributor, if known, that such newsrack is suspected of being abandoned. Such newsrack shall not be removed if the distributor informs the director the newsrack has not been abandoned and promptly stocks and maintains the newsrack. Upon removal of an abandoned newsrack, the distributor shall be notified and given ten business days in which to request in writing an informal hearing before the director. Provision for such hearing shall be as set forth in MMC 5.85.090.

E.    Upon the removal of a newsrack, the distributor shall restore the public right-of-way to its original condition, including, but not limited to, completely removing the newsrack and refilling holes created for purposes of installing and maintaining newsracks. The surface upon which the newsrack was affixed shall be restored to a safe condition. (Ord. 682, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-17.08).

5.85.090 Abatement of violation.
A.    Any violation of any provision of this chapter shall be sufficient cause for cancellation of any permit, for placing a newsrack(s) at a particular location(s), issued pursuant to this chapter and removal of the newsrack(s).

B.    Upon cancellation of the permit, any newsrack that poses a danger to the health or safety of any person may be summarily removed by a designated public works department employee of the city. Notice of the removal and seizure and the opportunity to request a hearing to contest the removal and seizure shall be mailed to the person believed to be responsible for the removed/seized newsrack based on information available to the director, including the address provided on the newsrack or the address stated in the newsrack permit, within five days after the removal/seizure of the newsrack.

C.    Upon cancellation of the permit for a newsrack(s) at a particular location(s), any newsrack that does not pose a danger to the health or safety of any person may be removed by a designated public works department employee after notice has been given to the distributor that the newsrack is in violation of this chapter. Notice shall be given by posting the notice on the newsrack to be removed and mailing the notice, if feasible, to the address stated on the newsrack permit. Notice shall be deemed given upon the date of mailing or the date of posting whichever occurs first. If no adequate identification for mailing is shown on the newsrack or adequate identification for mailing cannot be determined from a newsrack permit, posting of the notice on the newsrack alone shall be sufficient. The distributor shall be given ten business days from the date of the notice to remedy the violation and/or contest removal by filing a written request for a hearing before the director. Both forms of notice shall state the place to request a hearing to contest removal of the newsrack.

D.    Any distributor notified of a violation may submit a written request for a hearing before the director, which hearing shall be held not less then ten business days after the request is made and received. The hearing shall be informal, but both sides may give oral and written evidence. Any action by the city, except for removal of a newsrack that poses a danger to the health or safety of any person, with respect to the alleged violation shall be stayed pending the director’s decision following the hearing, which decision shall be rendered no later than ten business days after the hearing. The director may give oral notice of the decision at the close of the hearing, but shall give written notice of all decisions.

E.    The newsrack(s) may be removed if the distributor has (1) neither submitted a written request for hearing before the director nor remedied the violation within ten business days following date of notice, or (2) has failed to remedy the violation within ten business days after receiving a copy of the written decision, if there is a determination at such hearing that the newsrack(s) is in violation of this chapter. The city shall notify the distributor of the removal of the newsrack(s) by mailing such notice to the distributor at the address shown on the removed newsrack or the address stated on the newsrack permit. If it is not possible to determine a mailing address, in such case notification shall not be required.

F.    Removed newsracks shall be retained by the city and may be recovered by the distributor within thirty calendar days after written notice by mail to the distributor regarding the removal of the newsrack, or removed without written notice if the city does not have adequate information for such notice. Notice shall be deemed complete on the date the notice is mailed, or the newsrack is removed if the city cannot provide notice due to a lack of information. Newsracks removed by the city shall be retained at an appropriate city location. Newsracks which are not claimed within thirty calendar days of the notice of the removal, or the date of removal when notice is not possible, shall be deemed permanently abandoned and shall be disposed of by the city in whatever fashion it deems appropriate. The disposition of any money in a newsrack to be disposed shall be determined by the city manager if such monies are not claimed by the distributor within thirty days of written notice of the removal of the newsrack.

G.    The distributor shall reimburse the city for costs and expenses incurred by the city for removing, transporting, storing, and, if required, disposing of such newsrack and restoring the public right-of-way to its original condition, whether or not the distributor claims the removed newsrack.

An “unruly gathering” means a party or other gathering which occurs on or adjacent to private property in the city (hereinafter “premises”) and which a police officer at the scene determines is a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare.

Additional visits to the premises regarding the same unruly gathering shall be deemed second calls for the purposes of this section. (Ord. 574, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-20.02).

5.100.030 Emergency response charges.
Whenever the police department makes a second call to an unruly gathering, the police personnel utilized during the second call shall be deemed to be providing special emergency security services over and above services normally provided. The cost of providing such special emergency security services shall be charged to the person or persons responsible for the unruly gathering as provided herein. (Ord. 574, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-20.03).

5.100.040 Calculation of charges.
The charge for providing special emergency security services during a second call to an unruly gathering shall be calculated by the police department utilizing the hourly pay rates for each member of the public safety forces, including fire department personnel when utilized, and shall be adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in such hourly rates. Said charge may include the cost of providing equipment to the scene of the unruly gathering and the cost of repairing or replacing equipment damaged at the scene. The total charges payable under this section shall be the actual cost of providing the services but not less than two hundred dollars, plus the cost of actual damages to city property, if any, for a single response. Additional visits to the same gathering shall be separately charged. (Ord. 574, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-20.04).

5.100.050 Collection of charges.
The person or persons in charge of the premises and the person or persons in charge of the unruly gathering, or if any such person is a minor, then the parent or guardians of such person, shall be jointly and severally liable for the cost of providing the special emergency security services as provided in this chapter. If the property is rented as a short-term residential rental at the time of the unruly disturbance, the permittee and authorized agent, as those terms are defined in Chapter 7.30 MMC, are jointly and severally liable with all other persons in charge of the premises or gathering for the costs of providing the special emergency security services.

Within ten days of the second call to an unruly gathering, the chief of police or his designee shall calculate the charges payable under this chapter and shall cause a bill to be produced and sent to the persons responsible for such charges.

In the event that such a bill is not paid, in cash, within thirty days of its issuance, the bill shall be referred to the city attorney for appropriate collection activity. (Ord. 574, § 1, Amended by Ord. 771, § 2(A); 1976 Code § 5-20.05).

5.100.060 Mandatory warnings.
No charges may be made pursuant to this section unless the person apparently in charge of the unruly gathering has been informed of his or her potential liability under this section by a police officer at the premises during the first visit. If, after a good faith effort, no such responsible party can be found, the warning may be given to any person in attendance at the unruly gathering.

The police department shall develop a written warning document to provide information concerning this section and shall deliver a copy of such warning document to the person described herein during the first visit to the unruly gathering. (Ord. 574, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-20.06).

5.100.070 Other remedies.
The charges established by this section are cumulative in nature and shall not be construed to limit or replace any other remedies or penalties, civil or criminal, which may be available. (Ord. 574, § 1; 1976 Code § 5-20.07).

4.    Any other mitigating factors deemed appropriate for consideration by the animal control officer, peace officer or hearing officer.

E.    Upon receipt of written or oral notification by the animal control officer or peace officer that an animal is dangerous as defined in this chapter, the owner shall submit an application for a dangerous animal permit to the animal control officer within five calendar days. The application for a permit shall contain the name of the applicant, the applicant’s address, the applicant’s home and business phone numbers, the address and description of the proposed location of where the animal will be kept, if different from applicant’s, and a complete description and a photograph of the animal. The permit shall contain all of the requirements of MMC 6.04.120 and any additional conditions or requirements deemed necessary by the animal control officer or peace officer to protect the public health or safety.

F.    Should the owner of the animal wish to contest the dangerous animal designation, the owner may request a hearing, to be conducted according to the procedures set forth in MMC 6.04.115. The owner shall submit a written request for a dangerous animal hearing to the animal control officer or peace officer within five calendar days of written notification by the animal control officer or peace officer that the animal has been declared dangerous. Should the owner not submit a request for a hearing within five calendar days of notification, the hearing process shall be deemed waived by the owner and the dangerous animal declaration will be considered final by the county director of the environmental services agency, or the city. In that event, the county director of the environmental services agency or the city may allow the dangerous animal permit to be issued without a hearing. Unless a dangerous animal permit is immediately obtained, the animal shall be impounded at the owner’s expense pending appropriate disposition as determined by the animal control officer or peace officer. (Ord. 704, § 2)

6.04.105 Declaration of vicious animals.
A.    No person shall keep, have, maintain, sell, trade or let for hire an animal which has been designated as vicious pursuant to this chapter.

B.    If an animal control officer or peace officer has investigated and determined that an animal is vicious, the animal control officer or peace officer shall deliver to the owner of the animal written notice of that determination. The animal control officer or peace officer shall immediately impound, or cause to be impounded, the animal and shall cause the animal to be humanely destroyed unless the owner requests a hearing under subsection (C) of this section.

C.    If the owner of the animal disputes the designation of the animal as a vicious animal by the animal control officer or peace officer, he or she may submit a written request for a hearing to the animal control officer or peace officer within five calendar days of notification. Such hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in MMC 6.04.115. Failure of the owner to request a hearing shall result in the animal being declared vicious and humanely destroyed. The vicious animal declaration will be considered final by the county director of the environmental services agency or the city.

D.    If, after investigation by an animal control officer or peace officer, that officer determines that probable cause does not exist to believe that the animal is vicious, any interested person may appeal that determination by submitting within five calendar days of the decision a written request to the animal control officer or peace officer for a hearing and paying the required fee.

E.    In determining whether or not an animal shall be declared vicious, the animal control officer, peace officer or hearing officer may consider, as a mitigating factor or factors, whether at the time of the injury, attack or behavior, the person or animal suffering the injury, attack or behavior for which the animal is being determined vicious:

1.    Provoked, tormented, teased, abused or assaulted the animal thereby causing or contributing to the alleged behavior;

2.    Committed a willful trespass or other tort upon the private property of the owner or caretaker of the animal;

3.    Threatened or committed an unjustified attack or assault against the owner, caretaker or person in control of the animal; or

6.04.110 Issuance of permit for dangerous animal.
A.    No permit obtained under this section is transferable. If the owner’s address or the location where the animal is kept changes or the owner transfers ownership of the animal, the permit shall become null and void and an application for a new permit must be submitted to the animal control officer.

B.    A permit issued under this chapter is subject to renewal and approval each year and is subject to conditions and requirements existing as of the date of renewal. The permittee shall pay an annual fee for this permit pursuant to the procedures established by the division of animal control services. If the permittee fails to file an application for renewal or pay the permit fee prior to the permit anniversary date, the permit shall automatically become void. The fee for such permit shall be as set forth in MMC 6.04.290. This fee shall not be refundable.

C.    If the owner or permittee has a history of multiple violations of this chapter or of the conditions of any previously issued dangerous animal permit, the animal control officer or hearing officer may deny the permit and impound the animal for appropriate disposition as determined by the animal control officer or hearing officer. (Ord. 704, § 2)

6.04.115 Hearing procedures.
A.    Hearings held under this chapter shall be conducted by a hearing officer or designated representative appointed by the director of the environmental services agency. The city may elect to utilize the services of any San Mateo County designated hearing officer to hold hearings under the city’s animal control ordinances. The hearings shall be scheduled no less than five working days and no more than fifteen working days from the receipt of the request for the hearing unless agreed upon by the involved animal control officer or peace officer and the animal owner. A hearing may be continued if the hearing officer deems it necessary and proper or if the owner, or animal control officer and/or peace officer shows good cause.

B.    The hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner consistent with due process of law. Both the owner of the animal and animal control officer or peace officer may be represented by counsel. The parties may present relevant evidence and call and cross-examine witnesses. The strict rules of evidence shall not be applicable. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs. The hearing shall be tape-recorded and all documentary evidence submitted at the hearing shall be preserved. Any party may arrange for a court reporter to be present. Any party desiring the presence of a court reporter shall make all necessary arrangements and shall be responsible for payment of all costs.

E.    Within five working days of the hearing, the hearing officer shall render a brief written decision, which decision shall be final at the administrative level. The written decision shall be mailed to the parties by certified mail and include a declaration or proof of mailing which includes the date on which the decision was mailed to the parties.

F.    Unless the hearing officer for good cause otherwise determines, the owner of the animal is liable for all costs related to such hearing not to exceed three hundred and fifty dollars.

An animal designated as vicious will be held at the animal shelter for a minimum of five calendar days from the date of the hearing officer’s decision, after which time it may be humanely destroyed without further notice to the owner;

2.    That the animal be designated “dangerous” and the owner must apply for and obtain a dangerous animal permit as provided by this chapter within five calendar days of receipt of the decision letter in order to maintain the animal and the owner must comply with all mandatory dangerous animal permit rules and regulations as defined in MMC 6.04.120;

3.    That the dangerous animal permit shall contain additional permit conditions to supplement the mandatory dangerous animal permit rules and regulations as defined in MMC 6.04.120, including, but not limited to, the following:

a.    That the owner keep the animal muzzled at all times when the animal is off the owner’s property;

Proof of participation, a report of behavioral assessment, or a certificate of satisfactory completion from an animal behaviorist or organization approved by the hearing officer shall be provided to the animal control officer within seven calendar days following any required training;

d.    That the owner comply with any other permit requirement the hearing officer deems necessary to protect the public health or safety;

6.04.120 Mandatory dangerous animal permit requirements.
Any owner of a dangerous animal shall ensure compliance with the following rules and regulations which shall be mandatory requirements for any dangerous animal permit:

A.    When the animal is off the property of its owner, the owner must ensure that the animal is restrained with a leash not to exceed four feet in length and having a minimum tensile strength of three hundred pounds and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner or a person of such age, size and strength as can easily control such animal. Extraordinary care shall be taken by the owner to ensure that such restraint is sufficient to control the animal in a manner which will not endanger other persons or animals.

B.    The owner shall maintain the animal so that it is not a threat to any mail carrier, sanitation worker, meter person, or other person who has the lawful right to enter the property.

C.    The owner shall ensure that the animal is not kept upon any unenclosed premise unless it is leashed and controlled by a person capable of controlling such animal. The owner shall ensure that the animal is not tethered, tied or staked at any unenclosed premises. The owner shall ensure that the animal is not kept in a house or structure when the windows or doors are open or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the animal from exiting the structure.

D.    The owner shall ensure that the animal is kept in a fenced yard, kennel, run or enclosure approved by the animal control officer or peace officer. The owner shall ensure that all structures used to confine the animals are locked with a key or combination lock when such animals are within the structure. The owner shall regularly inspect the fenced yard, kennel, run or enclosure to ensure that it is secure to maintain the animal.

E.    The owner shall open premises upon which an animal is maintained at any reasonable hour for inspection by the animal control officer or peace officer and said premises shall be surrendered for inspection by the owner upon the request of the animal control officer or peace officer. The owner shall pay a fee for the costs incurred by the county or the city for the inspection or reinspection of property. Such fee shall be set forth in MMC 6.04.290.

F.    The owner of the dangerous animal shall post the entrances to the property where the animal is kept with a legible sign conspicuous to the public warning persons of the presence of a dangerous animal. The owner of the dangerous animal shall obtain an approved sign from the animal control program for a nonrefundable fee and shall surrender such sign in the event of the revocation of the permit, death of the animal, or approved relocation of the animal, or upon any other reasonable demand by an animal control officer.

G.    The owner of any dangerous animal must advise all members who reside in the same household and on the same premises of the conditions established by the permit for keeping or maintaining said dangerous animal.

H.    The owner shall strictly comply with all local and state laws regarding the care, use, control and maintenance of animals.

I.    In addition to a license, the owner shall ensure that the animal shall at all times wear a separate tag issued by the division of animal control services which designates it as a dangerous animal. The owner shall ensure that the dangerous animal be microchipped and registered with the animal control program for a fee specified by MMC 6.04.290 within thirty calendar days from the date the permit was issued. The animal owner shall be responsible for payment of said fee which shall be utilized by the animal control program to offset the cost of the chip and to maintain the registration program.

J.    The owner shall have the animal spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian, at the owner’s expense, within fifteen calendar days from the date the permit was issued. The owner shall present written proof to the animal control officer that the surgery was performed. In the event an animal cannot be safely spayed or neutered due to medical reasons, the owner shall present written proof from a licensed practicing veterinarian to the animal control officer that said animal cannot be spayed or neutered.

K.    The owner may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such animal to another county or city without notifying animal control at least twenty-four hours before such sale, transfer or disposal. Animal control will notify the proper authorities of the jurisdiction to which the dangerous animal is transferred. Should the owner of a dangerous animal wish to transfer ownership of the animal to another individual within San Mateo County, the new owner must submit to a property inspection, apply for and obtain a new dangerous animal permit, pay all requisite fees, and comply with all provisions of this chapter and the requirements of the permit.

L.    No more than two dangerous animals may be kept at any one household.

M.    The owner shall not allow any animal designated “dangerous” as the result of aggression against human(s) to be kept on property or within a household in which a juvenile person under the age of eighteen resides.

N.    The owner of a dangerous animal must notify the animal control officer of the animal’s death within twenty-four hours and shall produce the animal’s body for verification upon request. The owner of a dangerous animal must notify the animal control officer immediately in the event the animal becomes lost or stolen.

O.    The owner must pay all permit and property inspection fees as described in MMC 6.04.290.

P.    The owner shall comply with all other permit conditions or requirements imposed pursuant to MMC 6.04.100(A) or 6.04.115. (Ord. 704, § 2)

6.04.150 Inspection fee.
A fee shall be charged for the costs incurred by the county or the city for the inspection or reinspection of property. The fee charged shall be paid by the owner or person who has custody of the animal. Such fee shall be set forth in MMC 6.04.290. (Ord. 704, § 2)

6.04.160 Revocation or modification of permit.
A.    Subject to the provision of subsection (B) of this section, any permit issued pursuant to this chapter may be revoked or modified by the inclusion of additional requirements or otherwise, if the animal control officer has reasonable cause to believe any of the following to be true:

1.    The dangerous animal owner or any person the owner has allowed to have possession of the animal has violated any applicable animal control ordinance, or is in violation of any zoning, health and safety or building ordinance or Penal Code section relating to the keeping, care or use of any animals;

2.    The owner or any person the owner has allowed to have possession of the animal has violated any rules, regulations or conditions of this chapter including but not limited to dangerous animal permit conditions, or any requirement imposed by the animal control officer, peace officer or hearing officer as necessary to ensure the animal will not endanger the peace, health or safety of any person or property; or

3.    The owner has changed the location of the owner’s residence or the owner’s place of business or sells, assigns, transfers, donates, leases, or otherwise disposes of the animal for which the permit was issued.

B.    In the event that it is reasonably necessary to protect against a threat to the health or safety of the public, or of any animal, the animal control officer or peace officer may impound, or cause to be impounded, the animal while an investigation is taking place.

C.    If, after investigation, the animal control officer or peace officer concludes that it is probable that one or more of the above grounds for revocation or modification of the permit has occurred, the officer shall cause written notice thereof to be transmitted to the owner. Said notice shall specify the grounds of revocation or modification of the permit. Should the owner of the animal wish to contest the revocation or modification of the permit, the owner may request a hearing to be held before a hearing officer not previously involved with the permit issuance or investigation, as designated by the director of the environmental services agency within five calendar days of receiving the notice of intent to modify or revoke the permit. Said hearing date shall be not less than five working days or more than fifteen working days subsequent to the date the request for hearing is received. The hearing shall be conducted as set forth in MMC 6.04.115. After the hearing, the officer conducting the hearing may modify the terms of the permit or revoke the permit depending upon the owner’s ability to comply with the requirements of this chapter and to control the animal so that the health, safety and property of the public are protected.

D.    Upon written or oral notification by the animal control officer, or hearing officer if a hearing was held, of any modifications to a dangerous animal permit, the owner shall immediately comply with such modified permit requirements.

E.    Upon written or oral notification by the animal control officer, or hearing officer if a hearing was held, of the revocation of a permit for a dangerous animal, the owner of such animal shall within two calendar days of such notification surrender said animal to an animal control officer to be humanely destroyed or provide written proof to an animal control officer in the form of declaration(s) under penalty of perjury that such animal has been permanently removed from the county of San Mateo and declaring the new location or new address where the animal is to be kept.

The animal’s owner shall be charged with all costs incurred or fees applicable with respect to such impoundment.

B.    When the animal control officer or peace officer has reasonable cause to believe that any animal is dangerous or vicious, the animal control officer or peace officer may also impound or cause to be impounded the animal and keep it for such period not to exceed fifteen days in order to observe, examine and determine whether or not such animal is dangerous or vicious.

Actual costs to the city include the cost of the city’s pick up and delivery of the illegal box to the city’s storage yard, staff costs for investigating and processing the illegal box, and costs for storing the illegal box.

Any impounded dumpster or roll-off bin shall be retrieved by the owner or his/her representative immediately after the applicable charges have been paid.

6.15.190 Service charges.
The city council reserves the authority and right to establish, by resolution, a schedule of maximum rates to be charged any persons for the collecting and hauling of garbage and waste matter within the city and such schedule, when adopted, shall become and thereafter be a part of this chapter. A copy of any schedule so established by resolution of the city council shall, at all times, be kept on file in the office of the city clerk of the city and shall be open to public inspection.

6.25.010 Chapter title.
This chapter shall be known as the “Community Preservation Ordinance of the City of Millbrae.” (Ord. 620, § 1; 1976 Code § 6-5.01).

6.25.020 Findings and purposes.
The council finds and determines as follows:

A.    The city has a history and reputation for well-kept properties and the property values and the general welfare of the community are founded, in part, upon the appearance and maintenance of private properties;

B.    Some owners and occupants have permitted visual blight to occur on their properties within the city, including but not exclusive of abandoned, deteriorated and infested buildings, the accumulation of overgrown, rank and noxious vegetation visible to the public, the accumulation of broken-down or discarded personal property in front yards, and the strewing of debris and garbage cans on yards visible from the street;

C.    The existence of such conditions as described in this chapter is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city and contributes substantially and increasingly to the deterioration of neighborhoods as well as commercial areas;

D.    Abatement of these conditions will improve the health, safety and welfare of the residents and the image of the city because maximum use and enjoyment of properties closely proximate to one another depends upon maintenance of those properties at or above a minimum standard of sightliness. The beneficial effects of maintaining a minimum standard of sightliness for property in the city include, but are not limited to, appreciation of property values, physical improvement of residential and commercial areas, attraction of investors of capital to residential and commercial zones, increase in commercial trade and increase in the tax base of the city;

E.    The abatement procedures set forth in this chapter are reasonable, afford due process to all affected persons, and are designed to respect the constitutional and privacy rights of all persons;

F.    The regulation of the uses and abuses of property, as described in this chapter, reasonably relate to the proper exercise of police power to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public. (Ord. 620, § 1; 1976 Code § 6-5.02).

6.25.030 Definitions.
As used in this chapter and unless otherwise required by or more specifically defined in the context, the terms set out below shall have the meanings specified.

A.    “Enforcement officer” is the person authorized by the city to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter.

B.    “Multifamily dwelling” is a building or structure containing four or more residential units.

C.    “Owner” and “property owner,” is the owner or owners of record of real property as shown on the latest equalized assessment roll of San Mateo County or as otherwise known to the city by virtue of more recent and reliable information.

D.    “Responsible person” is a person designated by the owner to be responsible for the management of the owner’s property, and for purposes of the procedures set forth in this chapter, the responsible person shall be deemed an agent of the owner. (Ord. 620, § 1; 1976 Code § 6-5.03).

6.25.040 Authority for adoption – Application.
A.    The procedures set forth in this chapter for the city’s abatement of a nuisance and levy of a special assessment against a parcel to recover all of the city’s costs to abate the nuisance are adopted under Government Code Section 38771 et seq.

B.    The procedures set forth in this chapter are not exclusive and are in addition to and shall be coordinated with the procedures for abatement conferred upon the city by Civil Code Section 3494, Code of Civil Procedure Section 731, Government Code Section 38773, Health and Safety Code Section 17920, or any other lawful authority.

C.    The procedures set forth in this chapter for abatement apply to any nuisance which the city declares is a nuisance pursuant to a provision of this code or other ordinance which the city may adopt. (Ord. 620, § 1; 1976 Code § 6-5.04).

D.    The owner or any responsible person may be represented by anyone of their choice or may represent themselves.

E.    The hearing shall not be conducted according to the formal rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state.

If the hearing panel determines that a nuisance exists which is likely to recur after abatement, the owner may be directed to take adequate precautions for a period of time not to exceed one year so that the nuisance will not recur. Copies of the decision shall be sent to the owner, the responsible person (if such person has been involved in the proceedings), the enforcement officer, and the city clerk.

B.    If the enforcement officer determines that the owner or responsible person has completely abated the nuisance, all proceedings under this chapter shall be terminated.

C.    If the enforcement officer determines that the nuisance still exists, it shall be abated by the city in the manner described in the order of abatement. (Ord. 620, § 1; 1976 Code § 6-5.10).

The owner of the property shall be liable and responsible for, and required to pay, all such costs.

B.    The owner or responsible person may request a hearing before the city manager or designee (hearing officer) to contest the statement of costs. The request for a hearing shall be made within ten days of receipt of the statement to the city clerk or the right to hearing shall be deemed waived.

C.    The hearing officer shall review the statement of costs and any information presented by the owner or responsible person.

(Ord. 620, § 1, Amended by Ord. 640, § 3 and Ord. 698, § 1; 1976 Code § 6-5.11).

6.25.120 Expenses a special assessment against the property.
If the property owner does not pay the expense of abating the nuisance within thirty days after receipt of the statement of costs pursuant to MMC 6.25.110, the costs shall become a special assessment against the real property upon which the nuisance was abated. The assessment shall continue until it is paid, together with interest at the rate of ten percent a year computed from the date of confirmation of the statement until payment. The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes.

3.    Any other evidence of engaging in business and the failure to deny in a sworn statement given to the tax collector upon request that a person is not engaged in business within the city.

Failure to make a profit or complete a transaction does not negate a finding of engaging in business.

H.    “Gross receipts” means the total amount actually received or receivable from sales and/or the performance of any act, service, or employment for which a charge is made or credit allowed. Gross receipts include, but are not limited to, all receipts, cash received, credits, commissions or fees earned, sales on time, cost of materials, labor or services provided, value of property taken in lieu of cash payments, and interest paid or payable.

Article II. License Requirement

7.05.020 License required.
No person shall engage in business in the city without first applying for and receiving an annual business license from the city and paying the city’s business license tax described in this chapter. Operation of a business in the city without a business license and payment of the business license tax shall constitute a separate violation for each day that such business is conducted. It is also unlawful and shall constitute a separate violation for any person to engage in business with an independent contractor conducting business in the city that does not have a current valid business license issued by the city. (Ord. 588, § 2, Amended by Ord. 614, § 1; 1976 Code § 7-1.201).

7.05.030 Purpose.
The business license and license tax required by this chapter are imposed through the taxing power of the city solely for the purpose of obtaining general revenue. Payment of the license tax and issuance of a business license does not release or in any way excuse a person from compliance with other applicable provisions of this code or other laws, including any permit or other license requirement. Issuance of the business license does not entitle the holder thereof to conduct a business in a manner or location otherwise prohibited or regulated by law. (Ord. 588, § 2; 1976 Code § 7-1.202).

7.05.040 Prohibition on assignment or transfer of license.
No license granted or issued under this chapter shall be transferable or assignable in any manner. A license shall be automatically revoked in the event that the person identified on the license as the licensee either transfers or assigns the license or allows the license to be used by another person. (Ord. 588, § 2; 1976 Code § 7-1.203).

7.05.050 Separate license for each type of business activity.
A separate business license is required for each business activity which falls within a different business classification as defined in this chapter. A separate business will not be deemed to include any isolated transaction or activity that is ancillary to a primary business. (Ord. 588, § 2; 1976 Code § 7-1.204).

7.05.060 Separate license for each branch establishment or place of business.
A separate license must be obtained for each branch office or place of business located in the city. However, if the licensee engages in the same business at each branch office, the licensee may request a consolidated license in which the tax base will be consolidated and one tax shall be paid based upon the rate applicable to that business classification. (Ord. 588, § 2; 1976 Code § 7-1.205).

7.05.070 Change of location of business.
In the event that a business with a valid license moves or changes its location of business, the licensee shall notify the tax collector of the change of address. (Ord. 588, § 2; 1976 Code § 7-1.206).

Article III. Exclusions and Exemptions

7.05.080 Exclusions.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting or carrying on any business excluded from the payment of business license taxes as are prescribed by this chapter by virtue of the Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the state of California. (Ord. 588, § 2; 1976 Code § 7-1.301).

7.05.090 Exemptions.
The provisions of this chapter shall not require the payment of a business license tax, but the tax collector may issue a business license certificate for the following:

A.    Nonprofits: Any nonprofit organization or corporation which has qualified for exemption from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(1), (2) or (3) of the Internal Revenue Code, provided that the business is operated wholly for the benefit of nonprofit purposes and no profit is derived, either directly or indirectly, by any person;

B.    Disabled Veteran: Every honorably discharged or relieved soldier, sailor, marine or airperson of the United States, who is physically unable to obtain a livelihood by manual labor, and who is a voter of the state of California, who distributes circulars and hawks, peddles and vends any goods, wares or merchandise owned by him or her, except spirituous, malt, vinous, or other intoxicating liquor. (Ord. 588, § 2; 1976 Code § 7-1.302).

7.05.100 Exemption application.
A.    Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to MMC 7.05.080 and 7.05.090 shall file a sworn statement with the tax collector, on a form provided, stating the facts upon which such an exemption is claimed, as well as documentation requested by the tax collector to support the requested exemption, such as, but not limited to, evidence of nonprofit status, prior year(s) tax return(s), or evidence of disability or discharge from the service.

B.    The tax collector may, upon a proper showing of exempt status, issue a business license to such person claiming exemption from payment of the business license tax required by this chapter. In the absence of substantiating the claim for exclusion or exemption, such person shall be liable for the payment of the business license tax imposed by this chapter.

D.    The applicant must file, complete and receive final approval for a DBA (doing business as) document with the county of San Mateo. All current owners must comply within six months of the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter or face a suspension or revocation of their permits. Failure to comply with this requirement is grounds for permit suspension or revocation.

E.    The sale or transfer of a company will require the new owner to apply for the prior owner’s permit held in accordance with this chapter.

F.    When submitting an application for each new and renewed permit, the applicant must pay any fees required under this code and a nonrefundable processing fee as set forth in the city’s fee schedule, adopted by resolution of the city council.

3.    The vehicle proposed to be operated is inadequate or unsafe, or it appears that the applicant lacks the financial ability to provide the proposed service in a safe and continuous manner;

4.    The applicant has been convicted of a felony or the violation of a narcotic law or any penal law involving moral turpitude; or has been found to have violated the provisions of this chapter; or has been convicted of committing or attempting to commit any type of consumer fraud or unfair practices; or has been found to have committed multiple violations of this code; or has had a similar permit revoked in any city, county or state for cause;

5.    The proposed name of the company, color scheme or characteristic insignia will tend to confuse the identification of the vehicles proposed to be operated with those of another owner operating in the city; or

6.    The owner has failed to provide required information, omitted relevant information, or provided false information on the written application or otherwise during the application process.

B.    The chief of police may suspend or revoke an owner’s permit for any of the grounds for which the chief of police may deny an application for a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, or for failure to pay any judgment for damages arising from the unlawful or negligent operation or maintenance of a vehicle for hire; provided, however, that no permit shall be denied or revoked except after a hearing for the owner to show cause why it should not be revoked as provided under this chapter. The city shall provide ten or more days’ notice of such a hearing in writing. This notice shall state the reason for revocation and the time and place of the hearing. (Ord. 13, § IV, Amended by Ord. 354, §§ 17, 19; Ord. 733, § 1; 1976 Code § 7-2.04; 1966 Code § 5203).

A.    Any owner holding a permit to operate one or more taxicabs, as provided in this chapter, who desires to add to the number of such vehicles shall do so only upon obtaining permission from the chief of police, or his or her designee, which shall be granted only upon application made in the same manner and under the same proceedings as are required in this chapter for obtaining a new permit.

B.    Any owner holding a permit to operate one or more taxicabs, as provided in this chapter, who desires to substitute a different vehicle for a vehicle operated under such permit, shall do so only upon obtaining permission from the chief of police or his or her designee, which shall be granted only upon written application setting forth the particulars of such proposed substitution, and upon otherwise complying with the requirements of this chapter.

C.    The chief of police, or his or her designee, shall have the same authority in granting or denying such application for permission to add or substitute a vehicle as is prescribed in this chapter for granting or denying an owner’s permit application.

(Ord. 733, § 1).

7.10.060 Liability insurance requirements.
It is unlawful for any owner to drive or operate, or cause or permit to be driven or operated, any vehicle for hire in the city unless such owner has filed with the Millbrae police department a written insurance certificate(s) evidencing that any and all vehicles for hire which may be driven or operated under any permit granted to such owner are covered under liability policy(ies) which satisfy the requirements in this chapter. The liability policies shall be issued by responsible and solvent corporations authorized to issue insurance policies under the laws of the state and the certificates shall confirm that the policies are in full force and effect at the time of filing. Any cancellation of the policy by the insurance company or the owner of the company without immediate replacement by the owner may result in a suspension or revocation of the owner’s permit. The Millbrae police department shall be listed on the insurance document as the certificate holder. The falsification of any insurance certificate by or on behalf of any owner or the failure to maintain the required liability insurance coverage in full force and effect at all times shall be grounds for revocation of his or her permit.

As used in this section, a negative test for alcohol means an alcohol screening test showing a breath alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 percent.

B.    Each owner is obligated to ensure compliance with this section for all drivers employed by the owner’s vehicle for hire business. Owners shall pay all costs of this program with respect to their employees and potential employees, except that owners may require drivers who fail any required test to pay the costs of the driver’s own rehabilitation and return-to-duty and follow-up testing.

C.    Testing procedures shall be substantially as provided in Part 40 (commencing with Section 40.1) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, except that each driver shall show a valid California driver’s license at the time and place of testing, and except as provided otherwise in this section.

However, an earlier negative result shall not be accepted as meeting the pre-employment testing requirement for any subsequent employment, or any testing requirements under the program other than periodic testing.

E.    All positive test results shall be reported directly to the chief of police, and the chief of police shall notify the owner affiliated with the driver of the positive results. In all other cases, the results shall be reported directly to the driver’s employer, who shall immediately notify the chief of police of the results.

7.10.130 Taximeter required – Posting of fares.
A.    Taximeters. It is unlawful for any owner or driver to operate any taxicab in the city unless such vehicle is equipped with a taximeter of such type, style and design as may be approved by the chief of police, and it shall be the duty of every owner operating a taxicab to keep such taximeter in perfect condition so that said taximeter will, at all times, correctly and accurately indicate the legal charge for the distance traveled and waiting time. Such taximeter shall be at all times subject to inspection by the chief of police, who is authorized at his/her instance or upon complaint of any person to investigate or cause to be investigated such taximeter. Upon the discovery of any inaccuracy in said meter, the chief of police is authorized to remove or cause to be removed such vehicle equipped with such taximeter from the streets of the city until such time as said taximeter has been correctly adjusted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the chief of police may in writing permit the operation of a taxicab unequipped with a taximeter on the terms and conditions, including rates, and for the time specified in such written permit, a copy of which permit must be displayed in the passenger’s compartment of such taxicab.

B.    Every such taximeter shall register the charge to the nearest ten cents and be equipped with a flag or other mechanical device with the words “For Hire” printed or stamped thereon. The flag shall be so attached and connected to the mechanism of said taximeter as to cause said mechanism to operate when said flag is in a position other than upright indicating that the taxicab is not for hire. When the flag is moved forward or downward, the operation of said taximeter shall start and shall operate in the manner defined in this chapter.

C.    It is unlawful for any driver of a taxicab, while carrying passengers, to display the flag or device attached to such taximeter in such a position as to denote that such vehicle is for hire or is not employed, or to have such flag or other attached device in such a position as to prevent said taximeter from operating. It is also unlawful for any driver to throw such flag or other device of a taximeter into a position which causes said taximeter to record when such vehicle is not actually employed or to fail to throw said flag or other device on such taximeter into a nonrecording position at the termination of each and every service. The foregoing requirements shall not apply to trips to or from points outside the city where the charge is fixed on a trip basis.

D.    All charges for transportation of passengers in taxicabs operated in the city must be based on the charges indicated on said taximeters and it is unlawful for any owner, driver or operator of any taxicab to charge any passenger(s) any sum in excess of the sum indicated on said taximeter. The foregoing requirements shall not apply to trips to or from points outside the city where the charge is fixed on a trip basis.

E.    The taximeter shall be so placed in said taxicab that the reading dial showing the amount to be charged shall be well-lighted and readily discernible by the passenger riding in such taxicab.

F.    Posting of Fares. There shall be displayed in the passenger compartment of each taxicab in full view of the passenger, a card not less than two inches by four inches in size which shall have plainly printed thereon the name of the owner, or the fictitious name under which said owner operates, the owner’s permit number, the business address and telephone number of said owner, and a correct schedule of the rates to be charged for conveyance in said vehicle.

G.     All taximeters must be inspected annually by the San Mateo County Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures. Failure of the owner to ensure these annual inspections take place and to maintain records of same is grounds for revocation of the owner’s permit. (Ord. 13, § 13, Amended by Ord. 354, § 17; Ord. 733, § 1; 1976 Code § 7-2.13; 1966 Code § 5212).

B.    The owner of every vehicle for hire shall keep such trip sheets in the owner’s business office for a period of three years after the date service is rendered, which trip sheets shall be open and available for inspection by any representative of the chief of police at all times during business hours. The falsification of any trip sheet by any owner or driver shall be grounds for revocation of his or her permit.

C.    The owner of every vehicle for hire, including self-employed drivers, shall keep a dispatch sheet which shows the time of dispatch of every vehicle for hire and a complete and accurate record of all drivers, which includes, for each driver operating under the owner’s permit: a photo, name, address, date of hire, date of termination, the number of the vehicle for hire operated by the driver, the hours of employment, a list of absences from employment, and a list of all motor vehicle violations, all traffic accidents, all complaints received from passengers or others, and the test results from controlled substance and alcohol testing.

Unless such books and records are delivered to the chief of police within fifteen days from the date of such request, all permits of said owner shall be suspended on the sixteenth day from the date of such request, until said books and records are delivered or such permits are revoked, whichever is sooner in event.

B.    All books and records, as defined in subsection A of this section, shall be subject to audit by the city or an agent of the city upon reasonable suspicion that the books and records are inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise in violation of this chapter. Owners shall cooperate with the city or the city’s agent to enable performance of such audit. If such audit reveals that the owner’s books and records are inaccurate or incomplete and in violation of this chapter, the owner shall pay the city for all costs of the audit.

Between the hours of ten p.m. and six a.m., taxicabs may stop, stand or park in place where parking of vehicles is otherwise permitted.

C.    It is unlawful to park taxicabs at any point other than a taxicab stand except while responding to calls.

Failure to pay the fee shall result in postponement of the hearing until the fee is paid or a fee waiver is obtained.

B.    The hearing officer, or his or her designee, may initiate administrative proceedings to determine if the unauthorized operation of a vehicle for hire has occurred. Notice of the initiation of this administrative proceeding will be sent to the owner and/or driver at least fifteen calendar days before the hearing date, with a copy to be filed with the city clerk. Failure of the owner and/or driver to attend the hearing shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

C.    A hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be set for a date not less than fifteen days nor more than sixty days from the date that the city clerk receives a request for hearing or a notice of appeal or from the date that the hearing officer, or his or her designee initiates administrative proceedings.

D.    Notice of a hearing conducted pursuant to this section will be served by registered or certified U.S. mail to the address on the most recent permit or permit renewal. The failure for any person, owner or driver to receive the notice shall not affect the validity of any enforcement proceedings pursuant to this chapter.

E.    Any hearing conducted according to this section shall provide a full opportunity for the person or persons concerned to be heard by the hearing officer. At the time of the hearing, the hearing officer shall conduct a hearing and consider any written or oral evidence regarding the issue of the hearing presented by the owner, driver, an interested party, and any officer or agent of the city. After receiving all evidence presented, the public portion of the hearing shall be closed. The hearing officer then may consider what action(s), if any, should be taken. The failure of any person to appear at a hearing under this section shall constitute a failure by such party to exhaust his/her/their administrative remedies, and a waiver of the same.

F.    Within fifteen days following the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue written findings and make a determination regarding the existence of the violation(s) and/or the subject party’s failure to otherwise comply with the provisions of this chapter. The hearing officer shall serve the order in the manner set forth in subsection D of this section. If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred, that the violation was not corrected within the specified time period, or that the suspension, revocation or denial of the permit was justified, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth his or her findings; ordering the violator to correct any condition(s); assigning any administrative fines or penalties as set forth below; and providing an order allowing for recovery of administrative costs, including costs incurred by the city in connection with the proceeding, attorneys’ fees, costs of investigation, staffing costs incurred in preparation for the hearing and for the hearing itself, and the cost of any re-inspection necessary to enforce the order.

If the hearing officer finds, after a hearing as prescribed by MMC 7.10.210, that any owner or driver is operating or driving a vehicle for hire without a valid permit or that an owner or driver fails to include a valid permit number in any written or oral advertisement as required by this chapter and Government Code Section 53075.9, then the city may impose a fine of not more than five thousand dollars for each violation, sufficient to cover the reasonable expense of investigation incurred by the city. The city may assess interest, which will accrue from the day the payment of the fine or assessment becomes delinquent. All fines, assessments, and interest collected shall be deposited in a fund established for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 733, § 1).

7.20.010 Purpose and intent.
The council of the city does find, determine and declare that:

A.    Consent. The practice of distributing, casting, throwing, and otherwise placing, newspapers, magazines, handbills and other papers on private residential property against the express wishes of the owner, or of an adult occupant, thereof, or of a person authorized by such owner or occupant to deny such consent, creates a serious police problem and a threat to the public safety and welfare in that, against the wishes of the owner or occupant, such property will be cluttered with an accumulation of such material and the absence of the owner or occupant will be thereby inadvertently advertised to persons of dissolute or criminal propensities and the probability of criminal activities on such property will be thereby increased so that more intensified police patrolling of such property will then be necessary, all of which is detrimental to the peace, safety and welfare of the public.

B.    Vehicles and Public Places. The practice of distributing and depositing, placing, throwing, scattering and casting newspapers, magazines, handbills and other papers in or upon motor vehicles and in and upon the public streets and in public places, except to persons who are willing to receive the same, creates a serious police problem and a threat to the public safety in that such material is permitted to fall, and is thrown, upon parking areas, public streets and public places and is blown about and accumulates as trash and creates fire hazards and an unsightly condition and requires extra expense to remove such trash.

C.    Aiding and Abetting. The practice of causing and permitting the practices outlined in subsections A and B of this section by employees, agents and contractors creates serious problems and threats to the public safety and welfare in that such causing and permitting of the said practices provides the inducement and consideration for the continuance thereof and constitutes the source thereof.

D.    Need of Law. That the public interest, convenience and necessity require the removal of, and this chapter is enacted to remove, said police problems and threat to the public health, safety and welfare and require the protection of, and this chapter is enacted to protect the people against the nuisance of, and incident to, the promiscuous distribution of newspapers, magazines, handbills and circulars on private residential property, on vehicles and in public places.

The city council hereby finds that the adoption of a comprehensive ordinance regulating the issuance of and operating conditions attached to short-term residential rental permits is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a permit system and to impose operational requirements to minimize the potential adverse impacts of transient uses in residential neighborhoods and zoning districts on traffic, noise and density, to ensure the health, safety and welfare of renters and guests patronizing short-term residential rentals, as well as the adjacent occupants, and to impose limitations on the permits issued in order to ensure the long-term availability of housing stock in compliance with the housing element of the city of Millbrae general plan.

D.    The city council hereby finds that the provisions of this chapter which impose restrictions on commercial speech, pursuant to the restrictions on advertisements, are necessary in order to advance the city’s legitimate interest in preventing rental activity that violates this code, and in regulating fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive advertising. These restrictions on advertising are necessary in order to prevent advertisers from engaging in unlawful rental activity and from misleading the general public to think that a particular property in the city of Millbrae is available for transient occupancy if, in fact, the advertised property is not authorized to be used for transient occupancy purposes in accordance with this chapter.

E.    The city council hereby finds that the city’s regulation of short-term residential rental uses in accordance with this chapter is a valid exercise of the city’s police power in furtherance of the legitimate governmental interests documented in this chapter. (Ord. 771, § 3(A)).

A. Supply. The city will endeavor to furnish the premises of each customer, so far as is reasonably possible, but cannot guarantee, a continuous, safe and potable supply of water at a reasonable pressure at the city’s water meter, and will endeavor to avoid any shortage or interruption in water service. In the event that the city is unable to provide satisfactory water service by reason of pressure fluctuations, inadequate volume of water, or intermittent supply, the city will not be liable to any customer for any damage, loss, expense, or inconvenience that may occur as a result thereof.

1. Continuity of Service.

a. Emergency Interruptions. The city reserves the right to implement temporary emergency shutdowns of or interruptions in the water system due to operational difficulties, natural catastrophes and other causes which may prevent or affect the provision of water service and the city will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from or arising out of such interruption. The city will make all reasonable efforts to prevent interruptions in service, and when such interruptions occur, will make every effort to reestablish service with the shortest possible delay consistent with the safety of the water system, its customers, and the general public.

All customers are responsible for paying (A) a monthly water service charge based on meter size and type of water service (residential or commercial/industrial); and (B) a monthly consumption charge per unit applied to the quantity of water that passes through the meter. The charges set forth in Attachment A, City Schedule of Rates and Fees, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter reflect the charges in place at time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Adjustments to these charges will take place by resolution of the city council and any updated charges will be contained in the separate city-wide fee schedule.

Water service in all cases, shall be in the name of the owner of the property. The owner of the property may authorize, in writing, that service may be billed to a second party, such as a property tenant. The owner of the property remains responsible for payment of all amounts due for water service. If the owner of the property has authorized a second party to receive billing for service, the second party must complete an application for water service and submit that form to the city. (Ord. 743, § 1, Amended by Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.0680 Meter requirement.
All water service will be metered and all water meters purchased by the city shall conform to American Water Works Association (AWWA) Standards C702-01, Section 3.6, and C703-96, Section 3.6. The city may request from the manufacturer or supplier verification which states that all water meters and/or components comply with all applicable requirements of this standard, and that such meters have been tested in accordance with AWWA Manual M6. Each water meter shall be synchronized so that there is no cumulative error between the internal readings on the meter-register and the external readings of the remote indicator. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.0690 Meter installation.
All meters will be installed and owned by the city. Meters will be installed at the property line in a public right-of-way or within the easement or at such location as may be recommended by the public works director or the public works superintendent. If a meter is removed at the city’s request for city’s sole benefit, it will be removed at the city’s expense. In all other cases, deposits and connection fees will apply. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.0700 Change in meter location.

Any customer may request that the city test the water meter serving their premises for accuracy. The city will test the accuracy of meters up to two inches in size within two weeks from the time the customer submits the request to the city. Such meters shall be tested using AWWA approved meter testing equipment. Meters larger than two inches shall require a three-to-four-week time frame to test for accuracy because these meters will need to be sent to a meter testing facility in contract with the city. Customers may request a copy of the method used to certify the accuracy of the meter and the results. Charges for these testing services set forth in Attachment A, City Schedule of Rates and Fees, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, reflect the charges in place at time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Adjustments to these charges will take place by resolution of the city council and any updated charges will be contained in the separate city-wide fee schedule. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.0730 Adjustment of bills for meter error.
The findings and determination of the finance director or public works director on adjustments of bills for meter errors are final, subject to appeal to the city manager in accordance with MMC 8.05.1300.

A. Meters with Fast Reading Registers. When a test reveals that a meter is registering more than two percent or greater than the actual flow under conditions of normal operation based on the AWWA M6 standards, the city will, within forty-five days, refund or credit to the customer the full amount of the overcharge based on corrected meter readings for the prior period, not to exceed six months, that the meter was in use, unless the exact duration of fast meter registration can be determined. If corrected meter readings for the prior period are not available, the city will refund to the customer the amount of overcharge based on the past average consumption for similar billing periods, not to exceed six months. The finance director or designee may elect to refund the differential immediately or to credit the customer’s account.

B. Meters with Slow Reading Registers. If testing indicates the meter is registering below the AWWA M6 standards, then the meter register will be replaced with a new register. For the period determined that the meter was registering slow, not to exceed one year, if the meter registered more than ten percent less than actual flow, the finance director shall charge that customer for past estimated average usage for similar billing periods based upon an analysis of similar type of account usage.

C. Nonregistering Meters. When a test reveals that a meter is not registering, the city may bill the customer for the estimated amount of water consumed while the meter was not registering. The finance director or designee may at their discretion determine the appropriate amount of any adjustments/refunds using analytical evidence, such as using past consumption history during the same period for the same account or similar accounts. The finance director or designee may elect to average the consumption over a period of time ranging from one or several years in order to calculate an equitable adjustment. (Ord. 721, § 1).

The amount of the deposit will be determined by the finance director or public works director and will be equal to the average bimonthly utility billing for each class of customer, e.g., single-family residential, multifamily residential, commercial, business and industrial, based on bills for establishments of similar size and function. The required amount of deposits for each category will be revised annually, to the nearest ten dollars, and will be effective on July 1st of each year and set forth in the city-wide fee schedule.

The finance director is authorized to return deposits or credit the account in a manner consistent with this chapter for any accounts which have been in good standing for eighteen months.

I. Bankruptcies. When the city receives notice that a customer has filed for bankruptcy, the city may apply the customer’s security deposit to cover any delinquent fees and charges the customer owes the city for water service furnished up to the date of the bankruptcy filing. The city may also enter into a new security agreement with the customer pursuant to applicable federal law, under which the city may require the restoration of the security deposit to the extent it is depleted, or the payment of a new deposit in the amount specified in the city schedule of rates and fees. The city may terminate the water service of a customer who is in bankruptcy and fails or refuses to enter into a new security agreement with the city to provide assurance of future payments and performance in instances where such is permitted under applicable federal law. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.1130 Utility billing.
A. Billing Period. The regular billing period will be bimonthly, or one billing after every two months of service. The finance director is authorized to change the billing frequency from bimonthly to monthly; provided, that customers are given three months advance notice.

The city may estimate closing bills based on the record of account for the final period to permit the customer to pay the closing bill at the time service is discontinued.

C. Payment of Bills. Bills for water service will be rendered at the end of each bimonthly billing period and issued by the finance department. Payment of all water service bill charges shall be sent to the finance office as specified in the bill.

D. Persons Responsible for Payment. All water charges shall be billed to the applicant of record who requested connection to the water system or their successor in interest.

If a customer has two checks returned for nonpayment by a financial institution in a one-year period, the customer will be required to pay his/her water bills for a one-year period commencing with the next payment by another payment method accepted by the city.

G. Uncashed City Checks. Any city check not cashed within ninety days shall be void.

H. Disputed Bills. A customer must notify the city in writing of any dispute as to the correctness of a water service bill, and request an investigation or an extension for the payment period, within seven days of receiving the disputed bill or any initial notice of termination of water service. The finance director or designee may meet with the customer in person or by phone at the customer’s request to investigate and resolve the dispute. If, following the meeting with the finance director or designee, the customer’s dispute is not resolved in a manner satisfactory to the customer, the customer may appeal the dispute to the city manager in accordance with the procedure set forth in MMC 8.05.1300. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.1140 Amortization agreements with residential customers.
The finance director, in his/her discretion, may authorize an agreement with a customer to amortize the payment of any bill where the customer can demonstrate satisfactorily that payment of the full bill will cause undue hardship. The finance director may determine the amortization period, which will not exceed twenty-four months. During the amortization period, the customer must pay all current bills in full plus the amortized past due amount. The city may not terminate water service for nonpayment if the customer fully complies with the amortization agreement. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.1150 Adjustments.
The finance director is authorized to establish and implement, in his/her discretion for any customer, a one-time adjustment of a bill due to unusual circumstances. (Ord. 721, § 1).

Any customer may have their water service discontinued by giving notice requesting discontinuance not less than three working days prior to the requested date of discontinuance stated in such notice. The city will attempt to discontinue water service as soon as practicable and reasonable, within three working days after the customer request. The city shall charge the regular call-out fee listed in the city schedule of rates and fees for restoring water service to any customer whose water service was discontinued at their request. The fee in Attachment A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter reflects the fee in place at time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Adjustments to this fee will take place by resolution of the city council and any updated fee will be contained in the separate city-wide fee schedule. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.1190 Emergency or temporary discontinuance of water service.
When the customer requests discontinuance of water service on an emergency or temporary basis, the city shall respond as soon as practicable and reasonable. The customer shall be responsible for paying the reconnection/reinstatement of service charge set forth in the city schedule of rates and fees reflecting the charge in place at time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Adjustments to this charge will take place by resolution of the city council and any updated charge will be contained in the separate city-wide fee schedule. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.05.1200 Notice – Delinquent accounts – Shutoffs – Reconnection.
A. When accounts become delinquent and late notices including shutoff notices have failed to produce payment by the customer, water service to the premises will be terminated.

B. The payment of utility bills is due on the fifteenth of each month or the next business day. If payment is not received by the thirtieth of the month, a reminder notice will be sent to the customer that payment is delinquent and full payment is due within ten days. If payment still has not been received within this noticed period of time, a disconnection notice will be sent to the customer. If full payment is not made immediately, the customer will become a candidate for turning off of water service. Public works staff will attempt to contact the customer in person to advise them they are turning off their water service due to nonpayment. If public works staff is unable to contact the customer, and if the customer is not home when the staff arrives to shut off the water, the public works staff will leave a door hanger to advise the customer that their water service has been turned off due to nonpayment. The city is not responsible for any subsequent actions to abate any public nuisance caused by the water service termination to a residence.

C. If water service has been shut off for a customer and that customer pays their bill in full, including any penalty fees due, and pays the call-out fee listed in the city schedule of rates and fees to be reconnected to the water system, water service will be restored. Reconnection will only be accomplished between eight a.m. and three p.m. of each working day. The public works director, in his or her sole discretion, may approve restoration of water service after city business hours for residents who have had their service disconnected and have paid all charges in full. These customers will be required to pay, in addition to past due charges, penalty fees, and the call-out fee, three hours of overtime at the rate of time and a half of a maintenance worker’s salary to have their water service restored after working hours. These fees and other charges must be paid in advance at the finance office prior to close of business before the order to restore water service may be issued.

D. The finance director or public works director is authorized to periodically adjust the process and deadlines for payment due dates on utility bills, reminder notices, and disconnection notices to be consistent with City Hall business hours, dates and processing procedures.

E. The finance director or public works director, in his or her sole discretion, may permit exceptions to this delinquent/shutoff process when the customer can prove extreme hardship will result if an exception is not granted. (Ord. 721, § 1).

8.10.010 Purposes.
The city council finds and declares the purposes of this chapter as follows:

A.    To protect the public potable water supply of the city of Millbrae from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the consumer’s internal distribution system(s) or the consumer’s private water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water system; and

B.    To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the consumer’s in-plant potable water system(s) and non-potable water system(s), plumbing fixtures and industrial piping system(s); and

C.    To maintain a continuing cross-connection control program which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems; and

D.    To establish that the state health official shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said state health official, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required (at the consumer’s water service connection or within the consumer’s private water system) for the safety of the water system, the state health official or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to said consumer to install such an approved backflow protection assembly(s) at a specific location(s) on his premises. The consumer shall immediately install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at the consumer’s own expense; and, failure, refusal or inability on the consumer to install, have tested and maintained said assembly(s) shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. (Ord. 689, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-2.01).

8.10.020 Definitions.
“Approved” as used in this chapter in reference to a water supply, means a water supply that has been approved by the state health official having jurisdiction. In reference to an air gap, a double check valve assembly, a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly or other backflow prevention assemblies or methods shall mean an approval by the health officer.

“Approved backflow prevention assembly (See definition below of backflow prevention assembly)” means an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with standards established by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) entitled “AWWA/ANSI C510-92 standard for double check valve backflow prevention assemblies” and “AWWA/ANSI C511-92 standard for reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assemblies;” and, have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the University of Southern California Foundation for cross-connection control and hydraulic research (USC FCCCHR). Said AWWA and USC FCCCHR standards and specifications have been adopted by the city of Millbrae and the department of health services.

“Auxiliary water supply” means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor’s approved public water supply will be considered as an “auxiliary water supply.” These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor’s potable water supply or any natural sources such as well, spring, river, stream, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.

“Backflow” means the undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases or other substances into the distribution pipes of the potable water supply of water from any source or sources.

“Backflow prevention assembly” means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow. Such means are described as the following:

1.    “Air gap” means a physical separation between the free flowing discharge end of a potable water system supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. An approved air gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply line measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel in no case less than one inch.

2.    “Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly” means a device containing two independently acting approved check valves together with hydraulically operating, mechanical independent pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The unit shall include properly located resilient seated test cocks and tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed to protect against a non-health hazard (pollutant) or a health hazard (contaminant). This assembly shall not be used for backflow protection of sewage or reclaimed water.

3.    “Double check valve backflow prevention assembly” means an assembly composed of two independently acting, approved check valves, including tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly and fitted with properly located resilient seated test cocks. This assembly shall be only used to protect against a non-health hazard (pollutant).

“Backpressure” means any elevation of pressure in the downstream piping system above the supply pressure at a point of consideration which would cause, or tend to cause, a reversal of the normal direction of flow.

“Backsiphonage” means a form of backflow due to the reduction in system pressure which causes sub-atmospheric pressure to exist at a site in the water system.

“City” means the city of Millbrae.

“Consumer” means any resident or business located in the city of Millbrae who uses or consumes water.

“Consumer’s system” consists of those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the water purveyor’s distribution system which are utilized in conveying potable water to point of use.

“Cross-connection” means any unprotected actual or potential connection or structural arrangement between a public or a consumer’s potable water system and any other source or system through which it is possible to introduce into any part of the potable water system any used water, industrial fluid, gas, or substance other than the intended potable water with which the system is supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over devices, and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow can or may occur are considered to be cross-connections.

“Degree of hazard” means either a pollutant (nonhealth) or contamination (health) hazard and is derived from the evaluation of conditions within a system.

1.    “Health hazard” means an actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical or toxic nature to the public potable water system or the consumer’s potable water system that would be a danger to health.

2.    “Plumbing hazard” means an internal or plumbing type cross-connection in a consumer’s potable water system that may be a pollution or contamination type hazard. This includes but is not limited to cross-connections to toilets, sinks, lavatories, wash trays, and lawn sprinkling systems. Plumbing type cross-connections can be located in homes, apartment houses, hotels and commercial or industrial establishments. Such a connection, if permitted to exist, must be properly protected by an appropriate type of backflow prevention assembly.

“Health officer” means the city of Millbrae is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, and shall be deemed the health officer.

“Industrial fluids” means any fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration which would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated used waters; all types of process waters; and, used waters originating from the potable water supply, which may deteriorate in sanitary quality.

“Pollution” means an impairment of the quality of water to a degree which does not create a hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such waters for domestic use.

“Potable water” means any public water supply which has been investigated and approved by the health agency.

“Service connection” means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system. If a water meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the water meter.

“State health official” is in charge of the San Mateo Environmental Health Cross-Connection Control Program. The state health official is any authorized representative from the San Mateo Environmental Health Cross-Connection Control Program.

“Used water” means any water supplied by a water purveyor from public potable water system to consumer’s water system after it has passed through the service connection and is no longer under the control of the water purveyor.

“Water purveyor” is defined as the city of Millbrae.

“Water purveyor’s system” refers to the source facilities and the distribution system of the city and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the water purveyor up to the point where the consumer’s system begins. The source facilities shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system. The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the consumer’s system. (Ord. 689, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-2.02).

8.10.030 Requirements of program.
A.    No water service connection to any premises will be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by the department of health services, San Mateo County, any and all applicable laws and regulations, and this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if the backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that the backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.

B.    The consumer’s system must be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city and department of health services, to determine whether unprotected cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the city and/or the department of health services representative will deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by a physical break in the service line until the consumer has corrected the condition(s) and is in full conformance with this chapter.

C.    An approved backflow prevention assembly must also be installed on each service line to the consumer’s system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served but, in all cases, before the first branch leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:

1.    In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the city, the water purveyor’s system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard.

2.    In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the water purveyor’s system which have been subject to deterioration of quality.

3.    In the case of premises having internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected or protected against, or where intricate plumbing and piping arrangements exist, or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line.

D.    The type of protective assembly required will depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:

1.    In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as defined in MMC 8.10.020, the water purveyor’s system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.

2.    In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced to the water purveyor’s system, the water purveyor’s system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly.

3.    In the case of any premises where there is any material danger to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the water purveyor’s system, the water purveyor’s system shall be protected by an approved air gap or approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.

4.    In the case of any premises where there is unprotected cross-connections, either actual or potential, the water purveyor’s system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.

5.    In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the water purveyor’s system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises.

E.    Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a make, model, and size approved by the city or the department of health services and comply with the definition of approved backflow prevention assembly in MMC 8.10.020. (Ord. 689, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-2.03).

8.10.040 Consumer’s duty to test backflow prevention assemblies.
It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have a field test performed by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester once upon installation and once a year. In those instances where the city or the department of health services deems the hazard to be great enough, field tests may be required at more frequent intervals. These tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester approved by the city or the department of health services. It shall be the duty of the health officer to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The consumer shall notify the health officer in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the official representative may witness the field tests if so desired. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul will be kept and made available to the health officer. Records of such test shall also be available at the department of health services. (Ord. 689, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-2.04).

8.10.050 Existing backflow prevention assemblies.
All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved devices for the purposes described herein at the time of the installation and which have been properly maintained, will be excluded from the requirements of this chapter, except for the testing and maintenance requirements, so long as the health officer is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the water purveyor’s system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than the minimum maintenance or when the health officer finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit will be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 689, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-2.05).

8.10.060 City’s promulgation of rules and policies.
The city is authorized to make all necessary and reasonable rules and policies in full compliance with the rules and regulations of the department of health services concerning cross-connection control with respect to the enforcement of this chapter. All such rules shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter and shall be effective thirty days after being filed with the city clerk of the city of Millbrae. (Ord. 689, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-2.06).

8.20.120 Service area.
A.    The service area consists of those areas within the improved corporate limits of the city, the unimproved areas within the corporate limits of the city, the unincorporated areas of the county and the areas within neighboring municipalities whose wastewater is legally connected to the city’s wastewater collection system under the terms of this chapter.

B.    Sanitary sewer service shall be provided, at the owner’s expense, to all structures within the city which have a legally constructed sanitary sewer lateral conforming to the requirements of this chapter. No sanitary sewer connections shall be made to the city’s wastewater collection system from unimproved areas of the city, unincorporated areas of the county or other municipalities without approval of an extension of service area by the city council and compliance with the permit requirements contained in this chapter. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 740, § 3; 1976 Code § 8-4.201).

8.20.130 Extension of service area.
A.    The service area may be extended to unimproved areas within the corporate limits of the city, to unincorporated areas of the county, and to areas within neighboring municipalities, subject to approval of the city council and, as applicable, by county or neighboring municipalities. Prior to approving any extension of service area, the city council shall consider the matter at a public meeting to determine the necessity of such an extension. Where the county or a neighboring municipality has the physical ability to provide sanitary sewer service outside of the corporate limits of the city, no service area extension may be granted.

B.    Sanitary sewer connections can only be made where city sanitary sewer mains already exist. An owner may, at his/her expense, apply for an extension of service area to extend the city sanitary sewer main to service his/her property. Any user requesting an extension of service area shall first make a written application to the city on the forms provided by the city, obtained from the city’s public works department.

C.    The application shall contain information reporting on the need for an extension, the lots, parcels or tracts of land within the extension, a legal description of the property to be served by the extension with consent of the property owner, the proposed size of the extension and location, plans, profiles and calculations on the design of the sanitary sewer mains, and shall include the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the owner and/or agents submitting the application to the director of public works for consideration, in addition to any other information the director of public works may require at the time of application. The application will also report on the impact that an extension would have on the operation of the city’s wastewater collection system/POTW. Any extension of service area shall be subject to compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act and the requirements of this chapter. The director of public works shall determine the completeness of the submitted application within thirty days of receipt of such application.

D.    Upon receipt of a complete application for a sanitary sewer main extension, the director of public works shall make an investigation of the proposed extension and shall make a director’s report through the city manager to the city council listing all findings necessary for approval including the estimated cost of the extension.

E.    The city council, upon receipt of the director’s report, shall consider the application and report, and after due consideration shall take action on the application.

F.    Upon approval of the application, the director of public works shall prepare a sanitary sewer main extension agreement to be signed by the property owner, and/or the owner’s designated agent and the director of public works, establishing the terms for design, construction, ownership, operation and maintenance of the sanitary sewer main extension. All costs associated with any service area extension, including application, design, construction, administrative and legal costs, shall be borne by the applicant unless otherwise authorized by the city and provided for in the sanitary sewer main extension agreement.

G.    Upon approval of the design for a sanitary sewer main extension, the property owner and/or the owner’s designated agent shall file an application for an encroachment permit pursuant to MMC 8.20.180.

H.    The property owner or agent, upon receiving approval of an application for sanitary sewer main extension and issuance of an encroachment permit, shall be responsible for the design, construction, inspection and testing of the sanitary sewer main, including all associated costs, unless otherwise authorized by the city and provided in the sanitary sewer main extension agreement.

I.    Upon construction completion, and approval by the director of public works, the property owner and the owner’s designated agent responsible for construction shall relinquish property rights to the sanitary sewer main extension which shall then be vested in the city for operation and future maintenance. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 698, § 1; Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.202).

8.20.140 Individual waste disposal systems prohibited.
A.    No individual waste disposal systems shall be constructed, operated or maintained to collect, treat or dispose of sewage within the service area. Septic disposal systems shall be considered as individual waste disposal systems. Industrial and sanitary waste holding tanks may be permitted to operate within the service area subject to issuance of a wastewater discharge permit.

B.    It is unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, seepage pit or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage. Use of cesspools or other means of sewage disposal, other than connecting to the city’s wastewater collection system, constitutes a public nuisance for which the city may take any action set forth in Chapter 6.25 MMC. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.203).

8.20.150 Public sanitary sewers, general.

(Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.204).

8.20.160 Building drain and sanitary sewer lateral.
A.    The property owner is responsible at his/her expense to construct, operate, clean and maintain on the lot or parcel owned by the property owner, all sewer laterals or waste holding tanks, individual waste disposal systems including septic systems, if permitted, sewage ejector pump stations and appurtenant pipelines, valves and structures to either the point of connection with the cleanout wye on the sanitary sewer lateral or to the city sanitary sewer main as provided below, in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The city shall maintain the sewer lateral from the cleanout wye to the city sanitary sewer main when a cleanout is provided either in the sidewalk, or if there is no sidewalk within the public right-of-way then within two and one-half feet of the city main (see Illustration 1A at the end of this chapter). In such instances, the cleanout must be accessible at all times. When the cleanout is located outside of these designated areas, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the sewer lateral all the way to the city sanitary sewer main including the sanitary sewer lateral’s wye junction to the main. Where a cleanout does not exist and the property owner desires to install one, the city will not accept maintenance responsibility from the new cleanout to the city’s main until the property owner satisfies the director or his designee as to the condition of that lateral.

B.    Sanitary sewer connections to the city’s wastewater collection system shall be limited to one sanitary sewer lateral per lot, parcel or tract of land as described in MMC 8.20.240(E). Multiple or branched sanitary sewer laterals serving more than one lot or parcel, referred to as “joint sewer laterals,” are specifically prohibited. The limitation of one sanitary sewer lateral per lot as stated in MMC 8.20.240(E) shall also apply in the case of condominium subdivisions, planned unit developments and commercial developments unless specifically waived in a subdivision improvement agreement or sanitary sewer main extension agreement. Existing conditions not in compliance with this chapter shall be brought into compliance within sixty calendar days after a property owner receives notice from the city and in all cases prior to the transfer of ownership of property pursuant to MMC 8.20.450. The replacement of existing joint sanitary sewer laterals serving more than one lot or parcel shall be at the expense of the affected property owners, with the cost of separating the joint sewer lateral equally shared by the owners served by the joint sewer lateral. The director of public works has the authority to make exceptions to the requirement to separate joint sewer laterals in rare cases where, in his or her judgment, increased sanitary sewer overflows would result from separating them. The director of public works is also authorized to make exceptions to the general rule of equal sharing of the cost of separating a joint sewer lateral in rare cases where, in his or her judgment, this cost sharing would be inequitable and/or result in an undue burden on a property owner for the requisite repairs. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 707, § 1; Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 740, § 3; 1976 Code § 8-4.205).

The applicant shall provide for indemnification of the city, its councilmembers, and all officers, employees and agents of each of them in a form acceptable to and approved by the city attorney.

B.    The applicant shall be solely liable for any defects in the performance of any activity under a permit and for any failure or defect which may arise from the performance of any activity or work permitted. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.209).

8.20.210 Permit compliance.
Any permit, when signed by the applicant and issued by the director, shall constitute an agreement to comply with all permit conditions and all terms and requirements of this chapter. Any modifications to the permit and its terms and conditions shall be made only upon written agreement between the director and the applicant, and shall thereafter be binding upon the applicant. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.210).

8.20.220 Permit revocation.
A.    The director may revoke any permit issued under this chapter when the applicant fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit. Prior to permit revocation, the director shall provide notification to the applicant stating the reason warranting revocation. The applicant shall be provided ten days to respond to the proposed revocation action, unless the director determines that an action must be taken to protect the public health, safety or welfare. The director shall meet with the applicant and provide the applicant with the opportunity to respond to any revocation action in writing within these ten days. If the response provided by the applicant is deemed unsatisfactory to the director, the revocation will stand.

B.    An applicant, only after filing a response with the director and having the request to repeal the permit revocation denied, may appeal the revocation to the city manager within ten days of the revocation repeal denial. If no appeal is made within this specified period, the revocation shall remain valid. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 698, § 1; Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.211).

Article IV. Maintenance of Sanitary Sewers

8.20.430 Sanitary sewer laterals.
As a general rule, the property owner at his/her expense shall maintain all sanitary sewer laterals, including, but not limited to, the building drain, sanitary sewer lateral to the cleanout wye connection or to the city sanitary sewer main as provided below, building cleanout, sidewalk cleanout frame and cover, backflow protection and backflow relief equipment. The property owner shall provide all maintenance of the sanitary sewer lateral, including the wye connection to a city sanitary sewer main, to ensure unobstructed flow of sewage from the property to the city sanitary sewer main. The property owner shall be responsible for clearing all obstructions in the sanitary sewer lateral immediately upon discovery or notification by the city. When clearing any obstructions in the sanitary sewer lateral or performing any maintenance to the sanitary sewer lateral, the property owner must install a temporary trap downstream of the sanitary sewer lateral to ensure any rootball, debris or other items dislodged from the sewer lateral do not flush into the city’s sanitary sewer system.

The city may require property owners to remove roots from private laterals that are growing into lower lateral sewer lines in the sanitary sewer system owned by the city. Where this condition occurs, the city will promptly notify the private property owner. Within one hundred twenty days of receiving notification from the city, the private property owner shall remove the roots from the sanitary sewer lateral, and will make all necessary repairs to the sanitary sewer lateral to prevent a reoccurrence of root intrusion that reaches the city’s lower lateral.

Any sanitary sewer lateral blockage that cannot be mitigated through implementation of reasonable measures by the property owner and/or a licensed professional sanitary sewer cleaning contractor shall be reported to the public works department immediately. The property owner shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs, as determined by the director of public works, incurred by the city relative to any work or services rendered to remove a blockage or repair or otherwise work on a sewer line facility which is the responsibility of the property owner. The city shall only maintain the sanitary sewer lateral from the cleanout wye, inclusive of the cleanout wye, to the city sanitary sewer main under the following circumstances:

A.    A cleanout is provided either in the sidewalk, or within two and one-half feet of the face of curb or edge of pavement where there is no sidewalk, or in a side or rear yard within two and one-half feet of the city main (see Illustration 1A at the end of this chapter); when the cleanout is located outside of these designated areas, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the sanitary sewer lateral all the way to the city sanitary sewer main, including the wye connection at the main. The above maintenance responsibilities shall be conducted in full compliance with all applicable requirements contained in this chapter.

B.    Prior to the city’s acceptance of maintenance responsibility for that portion of a sanitary sewer lateral from a newly installed cleanout to the main, including the wye connection to the main, the property owner shall be responsible for having this section of lateral inspected internally by a closed circuit television camera and providing these results to the city for review. If the city determines that this section of the lateral is defective and does not meet city’s requirements, the property owner shall be required to perform all repairs necessary to bring the condition of the lateral up to city standards. Property owner must obtain an encroachment permit from the city prior to performing any required repairs on the city’s right-of-way. The city will accept maintenance responsibility for the section of the lateral from the new cleanout to the main only after both of the following conditions have been met: (1) the city has issued an encroachment permit for the required repairs in the city’s right-of-way, and (2) all repair work is completed to the city’s satisfaction.

C.    Where a property owner, or tenant in the absence of action by the property owner, refuses to mitigate a condition that causes sewage to leak from the sanitary sewer lateral after discovery or notification by the city, or if action is not effective, the city has the option to either make the repairs itself or hire a licensed contractor, all at the owner’s expense, to mitigate the condition. If payment is not made by the owner, the city may impose a property tax lien to recover all of its costs associated with repairing the leakage. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 707, § 2; Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 738, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-4.401).

All sanitary sewer laterals, cleanouts and sanitary sewer appurtenances which are found to contain leaks, breaks, uncapped cleanouts, down spouts or yard drains which discharge into the city’s wastewater collection system, and any sources of accidental, negligent or intended introduction of storm water into the city’s wastewater collection system are declared to be a violation of this chapter, and shall be abated by the property owner, who is required to remove or correct such improper sanitary sewer connections. The property owner shall have thirty days from the date of the city’s notice of violation to obtain permits and make repairs unless public health and safety considerations require earlier action. If the work is not completed within this time frame, the city, at its option, may either make the repairs itself or hire a licensed contractor to mitigate the condition all at the owner’s expense. If payment is not made by the owner, the city may impose a property tax lien to recover all costs associated with mitigating the improper sanitary sewer connection.

B.    Where a sanitary sewer overflow has occurred in city’s wastewater collection system as a result of a blockage, break or other issue in a sanitary sewer lateral, the property owner shall obtain permits and repair or replace the sanitary sewer lateral causing the sanitary sewer overflow within one hundred eighty days, unless:

1.    The property owned by the property owner is undergoing an extensive remodel, in which case the repair and/or replacement of the sanitary sewer lateral shall occur no later than the new occupancy date for the building, or

2.    The property owner claims financial hardship, in which case the city may conduct the repair or replacement.

If the work is not completed within this time frame, the city, at its option, may either make the repairs itself or hire a licensed contractor to mitigate the condition all at the owner’s expense. If payment is not made by the owner, the city may impose a property tax lien to recover all costs associated with mitigating the improper sanitary sewer connection.

C.    This chapter authorizes the director of public works to perform smoke testing on city sanitary sewer mains and sanitary sewer laterals for the purpose of determining the location(s) of leaks, breaks and improper sanitary sewer connections. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 738, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-4.402).

8.20.450 Testing and replacement of sanitary sewer laterals.
A.    A property’s sanitary sewer lateral(s) shall be tested for inflow and infiltration and all necessary repairs or replacement work shall be completed by the owner and approved by the city prior to transfer of title whenever any property is to be transferred to or vested in any other person or entity and such property includes any buildings or structures constructed more than twenty years prior to the anticipated date of transfer of ownership. Normally such testing need not be considered in the following circumstances:

1.    For a period of five years following a test which sanitary sewer lateral passed;

2.    For a period of twenty years after acceptance, by the city, of work performed for replacement of the complete sanitary sewer lateral;

B.    The director of public works shall establish or approve testing procedures. Testing will be the owner’s responsibility.

C.    At such time as the consent decree entered into between the city of Millbrae and San Francisco Baykeeper, approved November 15, 2010, is no longer in effect, which shall occur on November 14, 2016, unless the consent decree is extended, then the implementation of the testing and repair requirements by a property owner set forth in this section shall be at the discretion of the city, as long as such discretion is exercised in a manner to ensure compliance with all federal and state claims and requirements regarding the city’s municipal sewer system. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 738, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-4.403).

8.20.460 Inspection of sanitary sewer laterals as precondition to obtaining a building permit.
A.    For any project requiring a building permit where plumbing fixtures are added to the property, and/or more than twenty-five percent of the building area is being remodeled, altered or enlarged, the project applicant or property owner shall inspect all sanitary sewer laterals on the property for defects and satisfy the requirements in this section before a building permit is issued.

B.    Sanitary sewer laterals are to be inspected by property owners, and their condition evaluated by the city, according to the process set forth below.

8.20.485 Nuisance.*
No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged to a public sanitary sewer any waste that creates a stoppage, plugging, breakage, reduction in sanitary sewer capacity or any other damage to sanitary sewers or sewerage facilities of the city. Any such condition is deemed a nuisance and the city may invoke any of the remedies in Chapter 6.25 MMC or any other chapter or provision of this code. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 738, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-4.406. Formerly 8.20.480).

*    Code reviser’s note: Ord. 738 numbered this section as MMC 8.20.490. It has been editorially renumbered to avoid duplication of numbering.

Article V. Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Requirements

8.20.490 Determination of necessity for pretreatment.
The superintendent or agent of the superintendent shall determine a facility’s need for pretreatment. In making such determinations, facilities will be evaluated on, but not limited to, such factors as kind of activities, discharge flow rates and strength of discharge. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.501).

8.20.500 Pretreatment of wastewater required.
Users identified by the superintendent or agent of the superintendent must provide necessary wastewater treatment to comply with this chapter, and shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment standards, local limitations and the prohibitions set out in Article III of this chapter, Discharge Regulations, within the time limitations as specified by federal, state or local control authorities. Any facilities or equipment to achieve compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for approval before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the superintendent under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.502).

8.20.510 Pretreatment of industrial wastewater.
A.    1.    An industrial wastewater pretreatment system or device may be required by the city to treat industrial flows prior to discharge to the city’s wastewater collection system when it is necessary to restrict or prevent the discharge of certain waste constituents, to distribute more equally over a longer time period any peak discharges of industrial wastewaters, or to accomplish any pretreatment result required by the city. All pretreatment systems or devices shall be approved by the superintendent or pretreatment supervisor, but such approval shall not absolve the discharger of the responsibility of meeting any industrial-effluent limitation required by the city.

2.    In special cases, the city may require construction of sanitary sewer pipelines by the discharger to convey certain industrial wastes to a specific city trunk in the sanitary sewer. All pretreatment systems judged by the superintendent to require engineering design shall have plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable discipline licensed in the state of California.

B.    A gravity-separation interceptor, equalizing tank, neutralization chamber and control manhole is required to remove prohibited settleable and floatable solids, to equalize wastewater streams varying greatly in quantity and/or quality, to neutralize low or high pH flows, and to facilitate inspection, flow measurement and sampling. Floor drains from commercial or manufacturing buildings, warehouses or multi-use structures shall not discharge directly to the sanitary sewer, but shall first discharge to a gravity-separation interceptor. The type and size of these facilities will be determined by the pretreatment supervisor. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.503).

8.20.520 Industrial wastewater discharge permit requirements.
A.    No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged any industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to the city’s wastewater collection system without first obtaining a permit for industrial wastewater discharge from the pretreatment supervisor.

B.    The permit for industrial wastewater discharge may require pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge, restriction of peak flow discharges, discharge of certain wastewaters only to specified sanitary sewers, relocation of point of discharge, prohibition of certain wastewater components, restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, payment of additional charges to defray increased cost to the city created by the wastewater discharge, and such other conditions as may be required to effectuate the purpose of these rules and regulations.

C.    No user shall discharge industrial wastewaters in excess of the quantity or quality limitations set by their wastewater discharge permit. Any user desiring to discharge wastewaters or use facilities which are not in conformance with their wastewater discharge permit must notify the superintendent or pretreatment supervisor prior to discharging the wastewaters or using the facilities and obtain required approval.

D.    State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter.

E.    Upon the promulgation of any federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standards for that particular industrial subcategory, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The superintendent shall notify all persons affected by changes in federal standards and requirements as stated in 40 CFR Section 403.8.

F.    Contractors operating in the city may be required to read and sign a contractor’s operating agreement either at the time of business license application or building permit application. The contractor’s operating agreement shall serve notice to contractors of their duty to comply with all Millbrae Municipal Code regulations, including those contained in the city sanitary sewer ordinance, and shall be deemed to be a binding document between the city and the contractor.

G.    Any violation of the terms and conditions of an industrial wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the industrial wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in Article VI of this chapter, Enforcement Remedies. Obtaining an industrial wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.504).

8.20.530 Industrial wastewater discharge permit application contents.
A.    Users seeking an industrial wastewater discharge permit shall complete and file with the superintendent or pretreatment supervisor an application in the form prescribed by the city and accompanied by the applicable fees as established in Article VII of this chapter, Fees and Charges. The applicant may be required to minimally submit, in units and terms appropriate for evaluation, the following information:

8.20.555 Best management practices as industrial pretreatment limits.
A.    Background. Industrial local pretreatment limits may be expressed through conditions in the user’s permit as narrative statements (typically prohibitions) such as those set forth in MMC 8.20.290, numerical values such as those listed in MMC 8.20.310, or a combination of both expressed as best management practices (BMPs) (40 CFR 403.5(c)(4)). Historically, BMPs only applied to groups of low-flow discharges that had similar processes and discharged similar types of wastewater (e.g., photo processors and dentist offices). However, with the recent lowering of indirect discharge limitations and improved analytical methods, the city will begin using BMPs in cases where it is not practical or economically feasible for an industrial user to monitor for or attain specific numerical pretreatment limits. This section gives the city the ability to shift from numerical end-of-pipe chemical controls on an industrial user to BMPs and pollution prevention as an effective way for the city to achieve compliance with NPDES permit limits. BMPs are enforceable under 40 CFR 403.5(d).

B.    BMP Use Examples.

1.    There is insufficient flow from an industrial user or a category of industrial users to obtain a representative wastewater sample (e.g., dentist offices, photo processors).

2.    The proposed local limit is less than the detection limit and/or quantification level (40 CFR Part 136) of the most stringent analytical procedure.

3.    The BMP is clearly the most economically feasible method for regulating the pollutant of concern.

C.    BMP Removal from Permit. The city may consider a request to remove the BMP requirement from the indirect discharge permit if the permittee can demonstrate that the discharge is reasonably expected to meet the numeric local limit. In cases where the numeric local limit is calculated to be negative and where the industry’s effluent sampling results for pollutants with BMP requirements are below the quantification level, the city may also consider a permit modification request. Relaxation of the permit conditions does not allow the industry to return to its previous methods of operation.

D.    Inspections, monitoring, and numeric effluent limits may still be required by the city to verify that the industry remains in compliance. At a minimum, a certification statement is required certifying that the industry is operating under its approved BMP and no changes have been implemented.

E.    BMPs may be used in the discretion of the city where appropriate to meet such pretreatment standards in a practical and economic fashion.

F.    Industrial users subject to BMPs as a means of complying with standards of this part shall maintain documentation to demonstrate compliance with all BMP standards for the term of the permit or five years, whichever is longer. (Ord. 740, § 5).

8.20.560 Industrial wastewater discharge permit appeals.
A.    A permittee may petition to appeal the terms of a permit to the director within thirty days of the issue date of the permit. The petition must be filed prior to initiating discharges to the city’s wastewater collection system if discharges have been suspended or are dependent upon the issuance of the permit. The petition must be in writing. Failure to timely submit a petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the appeal. In the petition, the permittee must indicate the permit provisions which are the subject of objections, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition sought to be placed in the permit.

B.    The effectiveness of the permit shall not be stayed pending consideration of the appeal by the director. If, after considering the petition, the director determines that reconsideration is proper, the director shall remand the permit back to the superintendent for reissuance. Those permit provisions being revised by the superintendent shall be stayed pending reissuance. If the director determines that the permit terms are appropriate, the petition will be denied in writing. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.508).

8.20.570 Industrial wastewater discharge permit modification.
The terms and conditions of a permit may be subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit as a result of a change in the character or volume of the wastewater discharge, changes in business operations or practices, changes in state or federal limitations and requirements, violations of effluent limits, or factors which may affect the POTW’s effluent or their ability to dispose of solid wastes. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.509).

8.20.580 Transfer of industrial wastewater discharge permit.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operation. An application for a wastewater discharge permit must be submitted within thirty days of change of ownership to the pretreatment supervisor. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.510).

8.20.590 Industrial wastewater discharge permit reissuance.
A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with MMC 8.20.530, a minimum of sixty days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.511).

8.20.600 Reports that may be required (including proposed new businesses).
The superintendent may require those who are proposing to open a new business within the city to complete and submit the report listed in subsection A of this section, and require users who have a current wastewater discharge permit to complete and submit any and all reports such as:

A.    Baseline Monitoring Reports (Categorical Users).

1.    Existing categorical users currently discharging or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the superintendent, within one hundred eighty days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or a final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, the information listed in this subsection.

2.    An industrial user that is subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the superintendent, at least one hundred twenty days prior to a proposed discharge from a new or existing industrial business, the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards, an estimate of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged and the information listed below:

a.    Name and address of facility, including the name of the operator and owner;

b.    A list of any environmental control permits related to the facility;

c.    A brief description of the nature, average rate of production and SIC of the operation, and a schematic diagram indicating discharge points to the POTW from the regulated processes;

d.    The average daily flow and maximum daily flow, in gpd, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e);

e.    Measurement of Pollutants. The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, of pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required;

f.    Certification Statement. A statement, reviewed by the user or authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the standards;

g.    Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements as set forth in 40 CFR 403.12(b), (c), (d), and (e);

h.    All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified by the user or an authorized representative in accordance with MMC 8.20.540.

B.    Self-Monitoring Reports.

1.    Industrial users shall submit self-monitoring reports as required by the superintendent. This includes, but is not limited to, standards set forth in 40 CFR 403.12, to assess and assure compliance with all provisions in the city sanitary sewer ordinance and national pretreatment categorical limits and standards set forth in 40 CFR, Subchapter N, Section 401 et seq.

2.    If self-monitoring results indicate a violation of the user’s discharge limits, the user shall report it to the superintendent within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The superintendent may require the user to resample within thirty days after becoming aware of a violation in self-monitoring results.

3.    All test procedures for sampling and analysis of wastewater for self-monitoring reports or any other purpose must follow the procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 136 as may be amended and costs are the sole responsibility of the discharger.

C.    Periodic Compliance Reports.

1.    Except as indicated in subsections (C)(3) and (4) of this section, all industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the superintendent, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.

2.    The superintendent shall require appropriate reporting from industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. These reports may require the user to provide the POTW with documentation, typically through bill of lading, regarding the ultimate disposal of any waste that is prohibited from being discharged to the city’s wastewater collection system.

3.    If the superintendent so chooses, the reporting requirements for non-significant categorical industrial users (NSCIU) may be reduced; provided, that:

a.    Consistent Compliance with Pretreatment Standards. The user, prior to the control authority’s findings, must have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements. See 40 CFR 403.3(v)(2)(i).

b.    Documentation and Certification of Compliance. The NSCIU certifies that its discharge is in compliance with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements and annually submits the certification using the statement in 40 CFR 403.12(q). See 40 CFR 403.3(v)(2)(ii).

c.    Signatory Requirements. The annual certification statement must be signed in accordance with requirements in 40 CFR 403.12(l). See 40 CFR 403.12(q).

D.    Compliance Schedule Progress Reports.

1.    Industrial users in violation of their wastewater discharge permit, as required by the superintendent, shall submit compliance schedule progress reports. These reports shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user who is not meeting applicable pretreatment standards. Such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation.

2.    The user shall submit monthly progress reports to the superintendent until all violations have been cleared. The report should contain, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps taken by the user to return to the established schedule.

E.    Reports of Changed Conditions. Users must report to the superintendent any planned significant changes that will cause a twenty percent or greater increase in wastewater generation, discharge flow, or constituent concentrations or cause any changes in collection methods, treatment processes, discharge practices, including previously unreported pollutants or any other changes which may affect treated or untreated wastewater quality prior to initiating or continuing discharges to the city’s wastewater collection system.

F.    Reports of Potential Problems.

1.    All users must report to the superintendent or the pretreatment supervisor immediately, by telephone, when any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental, nonroutine, episodic nature, noncustomary batch, or slug load, poses a threat to human health or the environment, or may result in upset, pass-through, damage or interference of the POTW. Users must report to the superintendent or pretreatment supervisor all other accidental or slug discharges within twenty-four hours of the discharge occurring.

2.    This report shall be followed, within ten days of the date of occurrence, by a detailed written report describing the causes of the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent similar future occurrences. Such reporting shall not relieve the discharger of any expense, loss, damage, fines, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the discharger of any fines, penalties, or other liability imposed on the city on account thereof under Section 13350 of the California Water Code or for violations of Section 5650 of the California Fish and Game Code.

G.    All written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 740, § 5; 1976 Code § 8-4.512).

8.20.610 Analytical requirements.
A.    All sampling techniques for analyses to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall comply with 40 CFR 403.12. All pollutant analysis to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. All monitoring results shall be reported to the city in compliance with reporting requirements addressed herein.

B.    Except as indicated in subsection C of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow-proportional composite collection techniques. The superintendent must authorize the use of time-proportional sampling or grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged prior to the submittal of the samples. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with maximum discharge limits.

C.    Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

D.    When sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the superintendent or pretreatment supervisor within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results to the superintendent within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. The user may not be required to resample if the industrial waste inspector monitors at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the industrial waste inspector samples between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the results of the sampling.

E.    The superintendent may waive sampling and analysis requirements for a categorical industrial user for a pollutant if the pollutant is not present in the wastestream discharged to the POTW in concentrations greater than background levels present in the industry’s water supply; provided, that:

1.    The industrial user must provide the results of one or more samples prior to treatment which are representative of all process wastewater.

2.    In the event that a pollutant is subsequently found to be present or is expected to be present, the industrial user immediately resumes monitoring and notifies the superintendent.

3.    The industrial user submits a certification statement as part of its annual monitoring reporting stating that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastewater due to its activities.

Any such waiver granted by the superintendent shall be valid only for the duration of the industrial user’s permit. In order to continue the waiver for the period of the next permit, the industrial user must reapply for the waiver, including the submission of appropriate monitoring data. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 720, § 1; Ord. 740, § 5; 1976 Code § 8-4.513).

A.    User information and data obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the superintendent or pretreatment supervisor that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such claim of confidentiality must be asserted at the time of submission of confidential materials and in accordance with regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 2.

B.    When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available to governmental agencies who will have, without any delays, immediate and unlimited access to all records for review of confidential material. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

C.    The city’s determination whether any information can be kept confidential will be governed by applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

D.    Information accepted by the city as confidential shall be made available to the public only to the extent provided by the federal regulations contained in 40 CFR 2.302, Public Information, and applicable state laws and regulations.

$1,902.00

$1,973.00

BOD, $/lbs per day

$2,112.00

$2,190.00

B.    Definitions.

“Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)” means a measure using an EPA-approved method determining the concentration of organic matter reduced by biochemical oxidation expressed in pounds in a wastewater sample.

“Total suspended solids (TSS)” means all matter remaining as solid residue expressed in pounds upon evaporation using an EPA-approved method.

“Wastewater flow” or “flow” means the total volume of wastewater expressed in gallons per day (gpd) discharged through a sewer connection during the peak month of wastewater discharge in a twelve-month period.

C.    Calculation of Capital Facilities Charge. The capital facilities charge is the sum of the products of each unit charge multiplied by the number of units for any billing code.

Flow, gallons per day times unit cost of flow in dollars per gallon per day

 

TSS, pounds times unit cost of TSS in dollars per pound

 

BOD, pounds times unit cost of BOD in dollars per pound

 

Total Capital Facilities Charge

 

D.    The applicant or his/her engineer using a generally accepted estimating method approved by the city shall present a report with the application estimating the wastewater flow in gallons per day (gpd) for any premises, except a single-family residence or multiple-family dwelling, connecting to the city’s wastewater collection system. Upon city approval, the wastewater flow value estimated in the report shall become the number of flow units multiplied by the unit charge for wastewater flow to determine the flow component of the capital facilities charge. The TSS and BOD components of the capital facilities charge shall be calculated by the city based on the estimated wastewater flow and the average pollutant strength of the project billing code.

Wastewater flow used to calculate the capital facility charge for a single-family residence shall be two hundred gpd and for a multiple-family dwelling shall be one hundred forty gpd per living unit.

E.    The sanitary sewer capital facilities charge shall be paid at the time of or before making application for a plumbing permit in the case of new construction, or before requesting or making the connection in cases where construction has been commenced or is in existence. (Ord. 637, § 2, Amended by Ord. 684, § 1; Ord. 720, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-4.704).

8.20.830 Sanitary sewer and use charges.
A.    Each person whose premises in the city is served by the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), or which may otherwise be discharging sewage which is conveyed in the sanitary sewer collection system and/or ultimately passes through the POTW, shall pay for the use, services and facilities of the sanitary sewer collection system and POTW, a monthly sanitary sewer service and use charge, to be collected following each billing period. The table below describes the customer classes for the monthly sanitary sewer service and use charge. The charges set forth in the rate schedule attached to the ordinance codified in this section as Attachment A reflect the charges for each class of customer in place at the time of enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Adjustments to these charges will take place by the adoption of an ordinance or resolution of the city council and any updated charges will be reflected in the separate city-wide fee schedule.

B.    The charges for each person shall be determined using the following definitions:

Lifeline Customers. To qualify as a lifeline customer, a residential customer must provide satisfactory evidence to the director of public works or his/her designee that such customer has qualified for and is currently being provided telephone service under the universal lifeline telephone service rate or gas or electric service under the California alternate rate for energy, in which event such customer shall pay a basic sanitary sewer service and use charge per the table below so long as such customer is provided telephone, gas or electric services under these rates.

Variable User Fee. In addition to the basic sewer service and use charge, every customer shall pay the appropriate variable user fee for each unit (one hundred cubic feet) of water consumed each month, except that the variable user fee shall be based on consumption. For nonresidential customers, the variable user fee shall be calculated based on the consumption of water during each billing period. For residential customers, the variable user fee is based on the average water consumption for four months (December through March) winter water usage (the “base consumption”). Each August the base consumption amount is recalculated using the average from the last winter’s use of that customer and applied to the next billing period and all subsequent billing periods until the variable user fee is recalculated and applied for the next winter period water usage. Residential customers include, but subject to the determination of the director of public works are not limited to, single-family dwellings and multiple-family units such as duplexes, triplexes, multiplexes and condominiums. In the case of multiple-family units and condominiums, each separate dwelling unit within the complex is billed as if it was a single-family dwelling relative to the fixed amount of the sanitary sewer service and use charge. The variable user fee is based on the total water used unless each separate unit is metered separately, in which case the fixed amount and variable amount of each unit are combined.

C.    For a residential customer who has less than the four months or no recorded winter consumption because of the period of their service, the average for billing purposes shall be determined as follows:

Less than four months (one hundred twenty days) but more than thirty days: the average shall be the average of the actual service period calculated on the basis of actual full (thirty-day/twenty-eight or twenty-nine for February) months only. (Example: seventy-five day period would be considered two months.)

Less than one month (thirty days) except for February twenty-eight/twenty-nine days or no use history: the average shall be calculated on an occupancy per capita basis of fifty gallons per day for each occupant six years old or older on the day water service begins.

D.    The sanitary sewer and use charges shall be charged for each of the following classes of customer/user.

Service Charge ($ per acct/mo)

Basic

Universal Life Service

Variable User Fee (charged for the following customer classes) ($ per 100 cubic feet)

B.    The continuation of Millbrae’s economic prosperity is dependent on an adequate supply of water being available for current and future use.

C.    It is the policy of the city to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource.

D.    Landscapes are essential to the quality of life by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development.

E.    Landscape design, installation and maintenance can and should be water efficient.

F.    Water use and conservation goals are set out in and can be achieved by appropriate implementation of the city’s urban water management, water shortage contingency plan and the memorandum of understanding regarding urban water conservation in California to which the city is a signatory.

G.    Pursuant to the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, Government Code Sections 65590, et seq., the “model” water efficient landscape ordinance adopted by the department of water resources is binding upon and enforceable in the city (hereafter referred to as the “model water efficient landscape ordinance”).

H.    The ordinance codified in this chapter is enacted to carry out certain statutory responsibilities of the city as a water purveyor to achieve the maximum beneficial use of available water resources and to prevent the waste, unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water.

I.    The adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter is categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act pursuant to Section 15307 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations because this constitutes an action authorized by state law to ensure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of a natural resource where the regulatory process involves procedures for the protection of the environment. (Ord. 593, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-9.01).

8.45.020 Definitions.

8.45.030 Regulations, prohibitions and water use/conservation practices for all customers.
A.    The regulations, prohibitions and restrictions on the use of water set forth below shall apply to all customers.

1.    Each customer shall promptly repair broken or defective plumbing, sprinkler, watering or irrigation systems which permit the escape or leakage of water. Use of water through any meter is prohibited when the customer has been given ten days’ notice to repair broken or defective plumbing, sprinklers, water or irrigation systems and has failed to effect such repairs.

2.    Hoses used for any purposes shall have positive shut-off valves.

3.    No use of water shall be allowed which results in flooding or runoff in gutters, driveways or streets.

4.    Service connections for new construction will be granted only if water-saving devices or fixtures are incorporated into the plumbing system, such as low flow shower heads with shutoffs, and low flow water closets and all other conditions of this chapter and the municipal code are met.

5.    Use of potable water for consolidation of backfill, dust control, soil compaction or other nonessential construction purposes should be limited to those situations where no other source of water can be used or is available. The use of groundwater and/or reclaimed water for such purposes is permitted when approved pursuant to applicable restrictions and regulations.

6.    No water shall be taken or used from any fire hydrant or any unmetered city water system outlet/fitting/fixture unless specifically authorized by permit from the director, except by legally constituted fire protection agencies for fire suppression purposes.

7.    Covers shall be required for all new swimming pools and encouraged to be installed for existing pools.

8.    Except for fire protection service lines, a pressure-reducing valve or valves that will limit the static water pressure to each floor of the structure to fifty pounds per square inch gauge shall be installed in all new or remodeled residential structures.

9.    All new or remodeled residential, commercial or industrial structures shall have insulation of hot water pipes where such piping is located in attics, garages, crawl spaces or unheated spaces other than between floors or in interior walls to provide a maximum heat loss of 9.6 British thermal units per hour per linear foot for piping up to and including two inches in diameter, and one hundred British thermal units per hour per linear foot for all sizes greater than two inches in diameter.

10.    In all new or remodeled commercial or industrial structures, a pressure-reducing valve or valves to limit the static water pressure to eighty pounds per square inch gauge to the upper floor of the structure, shall be installed only if no supplemental internal pumping is anticipated. The intent of this section is to limit available water pressure to the structure consistent with uses of water on the premises.

11.    Water used for all cooling purposes and for commercial car washes shall be recycled. Self-service car washes may be excepted from this recycling requirement by the director; provided the director finds that water pressure, application rate and time of operation limit the amount of water used to an acceptable quantity.

12.    No single use of water shall be permitted where recirculation of water is economically and technically feasible. An economically feasible recirculation installation is defined as, over the useful life of the equipment to be installed, a system where the present worth of the cost of the water saved is more than the present worth of both the capital and annual operation and maintenance costs of the system. Such economic and technical feasibility shall be determined by the user and reviewed by the director. In the event there is a disagreement between the user and the director, a review and final determination shall be made by the city council.

13.    All water service connections to the city water system shall be metered with city approved meters.

14.    Homeowner-provided new irrigation systems and the expansion of existing irrigation systems for single-family and multiple-family residences shall be low water use systems.

1.    Irrigation of lawns or groundcover in any area, including residential, commercial, industrial or recreational/golf courses is recommended to be done only between the hours of six p.m. and ten a.m.

2.    Sidewalks, walkways, plazas, houses, businesses, driveways, patios, parking lots, tennis courts, buildings, awnings, or other hard surfaced areas should not be cleaned using water from hoses or by use of water directly from faucets or other outlets.

3.    Restaurants, meeting rooms, banquet facilities, hotels and dining facilities should serve water to customers only upon the individual request of the person consuming the water.

4.    Water used to fill or maintain decorative fountains or pools should be recycled. (Ord. 593, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-9.03).

8.45.040 Landscaping.
New or rehabilitated landscaping shall be installed pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance, in Division 2, Title 23, California Code of Regulations Chapter 2.7, as it may be amended, and this chapter. Consistent with the model ordinance, landscaping of any open space, park, playground, golf course, or other open area shall be planned to conserve water through choice of plants, landscape design and irrigation techniques. The development and use of the following water saving techniques shall be encouraged subject to relevant legal and economic constraints:

A.    Use of native or drought-resistant plants;

B.    Use of water application systems that are controlled to supply water efficiently to meet the needs of the given plants in each situation, as for example: drip irrigation systems and low delivery sprinkler nozzles;

D.    Collection and reuse of runoff water where possible; and

E.    Scheduling of irrigations according to plant requirements. (Ord. 593, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-9.04).

8.45.050 Allocations used as water conservation goals.
A.    This chapter establishes a voluntary conservation program based on 1987 water usage and the allocation methodology that was in effect during the city’s rationing program from the spring of 1991 through March of 1993. The director shall maintain and update the allocation system and provide allocation information to all customers. The city may establish a system of incentives to recognize or reward customers who maintain water use within the allocation goals. The maintenance and use of this allocation methodology and information shall in no way establish a precedent for or constitute an a priori basis for future allocations in the event that mandatory rationing or more stringent conservation measures are reinstituted.

B.    The methodology for establishing allocation water conservation goals is described below for each category of accounts.

1.    Allocation Goals for Residential Accounts.

a.    Summer Allocation Goals. During the “summer” months of April through November, bimonthly accounts will be allocated sixty-five percent of the amount of water used during the corresponding months or billing periods in 1987.

b.    Winter Allocation Goals. During the “winter” months of December, January, February and March, bimonthly accounts will be allocated eighty-five percent of the amount of water used during the corresponding months or billing period in 1987.

c.    Minimum Allocation Goals. The minimum amount of water for single-family residences and duplexes is set at six units (four thousand four hundred eighty eight gallons) per month. The minimum amount of water for multiple-family dwellings such as apartments, condominiums, triplexes and others is set at five units (three thousand seven hundred forty gallons) per month. No allocation will be established at less than these amounts.

d.    Maximum Allocation Goals. Initially, no single-family or duplex unit allocation will be greater than thirty-two units per bimonthly billing period for “summer” months or twenty-two (22) units per bimonthly billing period for “winter” months.

2.    Allocation Goals for Commercial/Industrial Accounts.

a.    Commercial, industrial and other nonresidential bimonthly accounts will be allocated eighty-five percent of the amount of water used during the corresponding months or billing periods in 1987 with the following exceptions:

b.    Allocations for connections that serve both inside and outside/irrigation uses shall be adjusted to allocate only forty percent of the estimated amount of water used for outside/irrigation uses in 1987 during the “summer” months of April through November. Outside/irrigation use is defined as the difference between the monthly consumption for the months of April through November and the average monthly consumption for the four months of January, February, March and December, all for 1987.

3.    Allocation Goals for Irrigation Service Accounts. Accounts classified for irrigation will be forty percent of the actual consumption for the same period in 1987. Where 1987 actual consumption data are not available, the director shall establish an appropriate allocation using relevant parameters and reflecting the equivalent of a sixty percent reduction from normal irrigation.

4.    Allocation Goals for New Accounts. Initial allocations for new single-family residences and duplex accounts will be established at twelve units per billing cycle. Initial allocations for new multiple-family accounts such as apartments, condominiums, triplexes and others will be established at ten units per billing cycle. Final allocations for single-family residence accounts will be calculated on the number of documented residents within a household. Allocations for the first two residents for single-family residence accounts will be established at seventy-five gallons per day each and fifty-five gallons per day for each subsequent resident. Final allocations for multiple-family residences will be established at fifty-five gallons per day for each documented resident. In the case of commercial or industrial customers, business data supplied to the director will be the basis for establishing the allocation.

5.    Allocation Goals Where No Past History Exists. When water records for calendar year 1987 are not available, do not exist for all or various portions of the year, or do not allow or provide the basis for establishment of equitable allocations, earlier records, records of customers with similar water uses or other parameters determined by the director may be used to set or adjust individual allocations. (Ord. 593, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-9.05).

8.45.060 Conservation planning and programs.
The city’s urban water management plan and the memorandum of understanding regarding urban water conservation in California set forth the requirements and goals for conservation plans and programs. These documents shall guide the city and the director in the planning and execution of conservation programs. It is the policy of the city to provide conservation incentives and support services to customers, including conservation services, materials and supplies, and rebates, where appropriate, to the extent of available resources and in accordance with procedures established by the director. (Ord. 593, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-9.06).

8.45.070 Enforcement.
A.    It is unlawful for any person or entity to violate or to fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter or the Millbrae Municipal Code, each such person or entity is guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this chapter is continued or permitted to be continued and shall be punished as herein provided.

B.    The penalties for violations of any provisions of this chapter are set forth in Chapter 1.05 MMC.

C.    Persons designated to issue citations hereunder and to enforce the rules and regulations of this chapter pursuant to the authority provided in Penal Code Section 836.5 are the director of public works, public works superintendent, public works supervisors, public works foreman, and the water resources and conservation staff.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.” (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.01).

8.50.020 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Accessory use” means a use that is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

“Alluvial fan” means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

“Apex” means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the city engineer’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

“Area of special flood hazard.” See “special flood hazard area (SFHA)”.

“Area of special flood-related erosion hazard” is the land within the community, which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM).

“Area of special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard” is the area subject to severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as Zone M on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM).

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “one-hundred-year flood”). Base flood is a term used throughout this chapter.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below grade level) on all sides.

“Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic, or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used of any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten or more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

1.    Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2.    The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

“Building”: see definition of “structure.”

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to an inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is the area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as zone VI – V30, VE or V.

“Development” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

“Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the city of Millbrae.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood or flooding or flood water” means:

1.    A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows).

2.    The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

“Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of flood hazard and the floodway.

“Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)” means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.

“Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risks premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other boundary of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or some similarly unusually and unforeseen event which results in flooding.

“Flood-related erosion area” or “flood-related erosion prone area” means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water which, due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

“Flood-related erosion area management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”).

“Floodplain administrator” is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. The appointed individual for the city of Millbrae shall be the city engineer.

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinances, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power which controls development in flood-prone areas. This term describes such federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for prevention and reducing flood loss and damage.

“Flood proofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures that reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. (See FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93 or most current technical bulletin for guidelines on dry and wet flood proofing.)

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. This is also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization,” as related to variances granted under MMC 8.50.230, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, City of Millbrae will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Governing body” is the local government, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

“Hardship,” as it relates to variances granted under MMC 8.50.230, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city of Millbrae requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbor likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of the structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure that is:

1.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2.    Certified or preliminary determination by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3.    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

4.    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Levee” means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Levee system” means a flood protection system that consists of a levee or levees, and associated structures such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) (see “Basement” definition).

1.    An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

a.    The wet flood proofing standard in MMC 8.50.140;

b.    The anchoring standards in MMC 8.50.170;

c.    The construction materials and methods standards in MMC 8.50.140; and

d.    The standards for utilities in MMC 8.50.150.

2.    For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are considered to be basements (see “basement” definition), not lowest floors. This includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent.

“Market value” shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

“Mudslide” describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush over, and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.

“Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area” means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow.

“New construction” means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by this community.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is complete on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city of Millbrae.

“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

“One hundred year flood” or “100-year flood” means a flood which has one percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the “base flood,” which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

“Primary frontal dune” means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope.

“Public safety and nuisance,” as used in MMC 8.50.230, means anything that is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

1.    Built on a single chassis;

2.    Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the horizontal projection;

3.    Designed to be self propelled or permanently towable by a light truck; and

4.    Designed primarily as temporary living quarters for recreation, camping, travel, or seasonal use (not for use as a permanent dwelling).

“Regulatory floodway” means a channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Person” means an individual or his agent, firm, partnership, corporations, association or cooperation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions.

“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

“Riverine” means relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream and brook among others.

“Sand dunes” means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

“Sheet flow area” – See “area of shallow flooding.”

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year, and is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1 – A30, AE, A99, AH or V1 – V30, VE or V.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and other proposed development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start date of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as pouring a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation of a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any repair, rehabilitation, addition or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2.    Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“V Zone” – See “coastal high hazard area.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter (i.e., permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter).

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic designated areas in which substantial damage may occur. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.02).

8.50.030 Lands to which this chapter applies.
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of Millbrae. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.03).

8.50.040 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) dated March 30, 1981, and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs), dated September 30, 1981, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs, and FBFMs are on file at City Hall, 621 Magnolia Ave., Millbrae, California, 94030. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.04).

8.50.050 Compliance required – Violation constitutes misdemeanor penalty.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this chapter shall be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not exceeding six months, or by both a fine and imprisonment. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.05).

8.50.060 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.06).

8.50.070 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A.    Considered as minimum requirements;

B.    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C.    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.07).

8.50.080 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such area will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that resulted from reliance on this chapter or any administration decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.08).

8.50.090 Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.09).

8.50.100 Establishment of development permit.
A development permit shall be obtained before construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in MMC 8.50.040. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator, and may include, but are not limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, all of the information listed in subsections (A) through (E) of this section is required.

A.    Site plan, including but not limited to:

1.    Spot ground elevations at the corners of all structures and at twenty-foot or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or one-foot contour elevations throughout the building site;

2.    Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer, and utilities;

3.    If available, the base flood elevation from the flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate map; and

4.    If applicable, the location of the regulatory floodway.

B.    Foundation design detail, including but not limited to:

1.    Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;

2.    For crawl-space foundation, location and total net area of foundation openings as required in MMC 8.50.140 and FEMA Technical Bulletins 1-93 and 7-93; and

3.    For foundations placed on fill, the location and height of fill, and compaction requirements (compacted to ninety-five percent using Standard Proctor Test method).

C.    Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, to which any nonresidential structure will be flood proofed, as required in MMC 8.50.140 and FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 3-93.

D.    All appropriate certifications listed in MMC 8.50.120.

E.    Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.10).

8.50.110 Designation of the floodplain administrator.
The city engineer/director of public works of the city of Millbrae is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.11).

8.50.120 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, those described in subsections (A) through (F) of this section.

A.    Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that:

1.    The permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;

2.    All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

3.    The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and

4.    The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For the purposes of this chapter, “adversely affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

B.    Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data.

1.    When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with MMC 8.50.040, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer MMC 8.50.140 to 8.50.220, inclusive. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption.

2.    If no base flood elevation is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then, in order to administer MMC 8.50.040, a base elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (One Hundred Year) Flood Elevations,” dated July 1995, as described below.

a.    Simplified Method.

(1)    One hundred year or base discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and

(2)    Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA.

b.    Detailed Method.

(1)    One hundred year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-HMS computer program; and

(2)    Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS computer program.

C.    Notification of Other Agencies. Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated the floodplain administrator may:

1.    Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse;

2.    Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

3.    Monitor the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse.

D.    Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection the following:

1.    The certification required in MMC 8.50.140 (lowest floor elevation);

2.    The certification required in MMC 8.50.140 (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures);

3.    The certification required in MMC 8.50.140 (wet flood proofing standard);

4.    The certification required in MMC 8.50.160 (subdivision standards);

5.    The certified elevation required in MMC 8.50.190 (floodway encroachments);

6.    The certification required in MMC 8.50.200 (coastal construction standards); and

7.    The information required in MMC 8.50.210 (mudflow standards).

E.    Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in MMC 8.50.230 and 8.50.240.

F.    Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of the chapter as specified in MMC 8.50.050. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.12).

8.50.130 Appeals.
The city council of the city of Millbrae shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.13).

8.50.140 Standards of construction.
In all areas of special flood hazards, the standards described in subsections (A) through (C) of this section are required.

A.    Anchoring.

1.    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic movement and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

D.    All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

E.    All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.16).

8.50.170 Standards for manufactured homes.
A.    All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within zones A1 – 30, AH and AE on the community’s flood insurance rate map, on sites located:

1.    Adjacent to a manufactured home park or subdivision;

2.    In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

3.    In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

4.    In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated above the base flood elevation by at least two feet and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

B.    All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites located within zones V1 – 30, V, and VE on the community’s flood insurance rate map will meet the requirements of this section and MMC 8.50.200.

C.    All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1 – 30, AH, AE, V1 – 30, V, and VE on the community’s flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either:

1.    The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation by at least two feet; or

2.    Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforcing piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade.

Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.17).

8.50.180 Standards for recreational vehicles.

B.    Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones V1 – 30, V, and VE on the community’s flood insurance rate map will meet the requirements of this section and MMC 8.50.200. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.18).

8.50.190 Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in MMC 8.50.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A.    All encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; and

B.    If MMC 8.50.200(A) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of MMC 8.50.140 to 8.50.220, inclusive. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.19).

8.50.200 Coastal high hazard areas.
Within coastal high hazard areas established in MMC 8.50.040, the following standards shall apply:

A.    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the lowest horizontal portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the piling or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood elevation. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards;

B.    All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide;

C.    All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in MMC 8.50.020. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage;

D.    Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings;

E.    Man-made alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood damage is prohibited; and

F.    The floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:

1.    Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection (A) of this section; and

2.    The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.20).

8.50.210 Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas.
A.    The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction or other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area.

B.    Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to:

1.    The type and quality of soils;

2.    Evidence of ground water or surface water problems;

3.    Depth and quality of any fill;

4.    Overall slope of the site; and

5.    Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope.

C.    Within areas that may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administrator shall require that:

1.    A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering;

2.    The proposed grading, excavation, new construction and substantial improvement are adequately designed and protected against mudslide damage;

3.    The proposed grading, excavations, new construction and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances; and

4.    Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.21).

8.50.220 Flood-related erosion-prone area.
A.    The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community.

B.    Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard.

C.    If the proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion, adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard.

D.    Within zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designed according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated “useful life” of structures, and depending upon geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.22).

8.50.230 Variance procedure.
The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structures, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the city council of the city of Millbrae to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring structures built below the flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.23).

8.50.240 Variance appeal board.
A.    In passing upon applications for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and all of the following:

1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.    The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and future owners of the property;

4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6.    The availability of alternate locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.    Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

B.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the San Mateo County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. The notice shall indicate that:

1.    The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and

2.    Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.

C.    The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal-variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report any variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.24).

8.50.250 Condition for variances.
A.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures in MMC 8.50.240 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B.    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in MMC 8.50.020) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C.    Variances shall only be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to elevation requirements, this means the city council of the city of Millbrae need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter.

E.    Variances shall only be issued upon:

1.    A showing of good cause;

2.    Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” (as defined in MMC 8.50.020) to the applicant; and

3.    Determination that the granting of a variance would not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in MMC 8.50.020 – See “public nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in MMC 8.50.020) of the public, or conflict with local laws or ordinances.

F.    Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependant use provided that the provisions of MMC 8.50.230 through 8.50.250 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

G.    Upon consideration of the factors of MMC 8.50.230 and the purposes of this chapter, the city council of the city of Millbrae may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.25).

8.50.260 Administrative policy and procedure 1-19.
This policy and procedure is being restated herein in its entirety. The more stringent requirements of this policy and procedure or this chapter shall take precedence.

The purpose of this administrative procedure is to set forth the specific policies and procedures necessary to implement and to comply with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as it relates to residential and commercial properties located within the floodplains of the city of Millbrae.

3.    Implementation and compliance

C.    Procedures for Complying with NFIP.

1.    The city engineer shall establish through the use of the NFIP panel maps (FIRMs) the areas located within the city that are subject to the requirements of the NFIP.

2.    Once affected areas are established, the city planner and/or building official shall notify the affected property owners when any one of the following occurs:

a.    Substantial improvement to structures as outlined in the NFIP regulations;

b.    Substantial damage to structures by natural disaster; or

c.    Substantial damage to structures by fire or flooding.

3.    “Substantial improvement” shall be the total of all improvements within a five year time period that equals fifty percent or more of the structure’s market value but not including the land value.

D.    Review and Permitting Process. The review and permitting process will be divided into five parts.

1.    Development Review. The city planner shall be the lead person in this review process.

a.    It shall be identified as early as possible in the planning stage if a proposed project is within the floodplain management area to enable the developer to design to the floodplain requirements.

All applications within the floodplain shall be reviewed by the staff review board (SRB) for compliance with city codes, policies, and procedures as they relate to floodplain management.

b.    A staff review board (SRB) shall consist of one member from each of the following departments: fire, police, public works, building, planning, and parks and recreation. The SRB shall meet on a regular basis to review development projects in the floodplain.

c.    Projects that do not need planning commission review shall be reviewed by the city planner for conformance with planning regulations, floodplain.

d.    Planning commission shall review each project otherwise requiring commission review and if qualified approve the project.

2.    Building Permitting Process. The building official shall be the lead person in this review.

a.    The building official shall participate in the SRB.

b.    Upon initial submission or contact with an owner regarding property improvements where the structure is believed to be within the floodplain, the building official or his designee shall determine if the property is in a floodplain, review the address folder of the project site to determine if any improvements have been done within the last five years, and will determine if the project exceeds the fifty percent threshold.

If the property is found to have had improvements within the preceding five years the total costs of the existing improvements shall be added to the project for the purpose of establishing if the project exceeds the fifty percent threshold.

If no improvements have occurred within the preceding five years only the project costs shall be the sole determining factor for establishment of substantial improvements as required by the floodplains.

c.    These floodplain management area regulations do not apply to any properties outside the floodplains.

d.    If it has been determined that the project meets the above requirements the developer will be required to design the project to incorporate the requirements of the floodplain management regulations.

3.    Construction Inspection of Building Structures.

a.    Prior to new construction the property owner shall be required to have the property and structure surveyed and elevations noted on a survey map indicating bench mark, spot elevation locations, spot elevation measurements, date of survey, surveyor name and registration number. This shall occur again prior to final approval to verify conformance with the approved plans and floodplain management requirements. One copy shall be included in the building division address file.

b.    Inspection by the building official or designee shall occur at the scheduled intervals beginning with the foundation. At that time the inspector shall verify lowest floor elevation as it relates to elevations established by USGS markers and reference points. Construction found to comply will be allowed to proceed. Construction found to be in non-compliance shall be brought into conformance before being allowed to proceed.

4.    Construction Inspection of Public Infrastructure by Public Works.

a.    The public works director shall assign project staff to inspect the construction, repair and improvement of public facilities and infrastructure to ensure compliance with relevant floodplain management regulations.

5.    Post Disaster Evaluation and Assessment.

a.    Post disaster damage assessment and evaluation shall be conducted using forms from FEMA 311 – Guidance on estimating substantial damage. The damage assessment team shall include the building official and another qualified individual who shall evaluate the structures and generate a damage assessment report using FEMA 311 software or most current software.

b.    Any structures determined to be substantially damaged shall be evaluated. If damage is found to exceed fifty percent of the structure’s value, the structure shall be brought into conformance with the city’s floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 688, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-10.26).

The owner of real property adjacent to or fronting on any portion of a sidewalk area shall repair and maintain such sidewalk area in a safe and nondangerous condition at the owner’s cost and expense. The owner shall have the primary and exclusive duty to perform such repair and maintenance, whether or not the city has notified the owner of the need for such repairs or maintenance or has performed similar maintenance or repairs in the past. This duty to repair shall include damage caused by any forces including without limitation damage caused by street trees planted within the public right-of-way or adjacent private property. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.02).

8.55.030 Liability for injuries to public.
Any owner required by MMC 8.55.020 to repair and maintain any portion of a sidewalk area shall owe a duty to members of the general public, including travelers on the sidewalk area, to repair and maintain the sidewalk area in a safe and nondangerous condition. It is a violation of this chapter for any owner to fail to perform the duties and obligations established by MMC 8.55.020 or to perform such duties and obligations in a negligent manner. If any person suffers personal injury or damage to property, as a result of the failure of any owner to maintain any sidewalk area in a safe and nondangerous condition as required by MMC 8.55.020, the owner shall be directly liable to such person for the resulting injury or damages, and no liability shall attach to the city for such injury or damages. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.03).

8.55.040 Notice to repair sidewalk – Commencement date.
When in the judgment of the city engineer, any portion of any sidewalk area is so out of repair or in such condition as to endanger persons or property passing thereon or as to interfere with the public convenience in the use thereof, the city engineer is authorized to notify the owner in writing, to be delivered to such owner, requiring such owner to repair, reconstruct or improve forthwith, in such manner, with such material(s) and to the extent as the city engineer may determine and direct, such that the sidewalk area is restored to a safe and nondangerous condition.

Within two weeks after such notice shall have been delivered to such owner, he or she shall cause to commence such repair, reconstruction or improvement as may have been determined by the city engineer and directed in the notice, and shall diligently and without interruption, prosecute the same to completion. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.04).

8.55.050 Notice – Method of giving.
Notice to repair may be given by delivering a written notice personally to the owner of the property adjacent to the sidewalk area or by mailing written notice, postage prepaid, to the owner thereof at his/her last known address as the same appears on the last equalized assessment rolls of the city or to the name and address of the person owning such property as shown in the records of the office of the city clerk. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.05).

8.55.060 Repairs – When performed by city.
If any owner refuses or neglects to make such repair, reconstruction or improvement when required and directed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, the city engineer shall cause such repair, reconstruction or improvement to be made, and any and all costs necessarily expended by the city in making such repair, reconstruction or improvement shall be reimbursed to the city as described in MMC 8.55.100. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.06).

8.55.070 Report – City engineer to file.
Upon the completion of the repair, the city engineer shall prepare a report specifying the repairs, reconstruction or improvement which have been made, the cost of the said work, a description of the real property adjacent to the sidewalk area on which the work has been undertaken and the amount against each lot or parcel of land proposed to become a special assessment to pay the cost of such work. Any such report may include repairs to any number of parcels of property, whether contiguous to each other or not. All such reports shall be compiled and filed with the city council on an annual basis, allowing the council enough time to approve the reports and forward any special assessment to the county controller prior to the date fixed by law for the delivery of the assessment book, as discussed in MMC 8.55.100. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.07).

8.55.080 Report – Notice of hearing.
Upon the completion of the repair, the city engineer shall cause notice of the cost of the repair to be given the owner (in the same manner specified in MMC 8.55.050 for the giving of notice to repair), which notice shall specify the date, time and place when the city council will hear and pass upon the report by the city engineer regarding the cost of the repair (if such date, time and place has been determined), together with any objections or protests, if any, which may be raised by any owner liable to pay the cost of such repair and any other interested persons. If, upon completion of the work, the date, time and place for the hearing have not yet been determined, the city shall send a second notice including such information at least thirty days prior to the hearing. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.08).

8.55.090 Hearing – Protests – Confirmation of report.
Upon the date and time fixed for the hearing the city council shall hear and pass upon the report of the city engineer, together with any objections or protests which may be raised by any owners liable to pay for the repair work and any other interested persons. Thereupon the city council may make such revision, correction or modifications in the report as it may deem just, after which, by resolution, the report as submitted, revised, corrected or modified shall be confirmed. The city council may adjourn the hearings from time to time. The decisions of the city council on all protests and objections which may be made shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.09).

8.55.100 Assessment of cost – Collection.
A.    The cost of the repair may be assessed by the city council against the parcel of property adjacent to the sidewalk area upon which such repair was made, and such cost so assessed, if not paid within fourteen days after its confirmation by the city council, shall constitute a special assessment against that parcel of property, and shall be a lien on the property for the amount thereof which lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest thereon is paid, or until it is discharged of record.

B.    If the cost so assessed is not paid within fourteen days, then the special assessment shall be delivered to the county controller (together with the engineer’s report and the city council’s resolution approving it), who shall enter the amount thereof on the county assessment book opposite the description of the particular property and the amount shall be collected together with all other taxes thereon against the property. The special assessment shall be delivered to the county controller prior to the date fixed by law for the delivery of the assessment book to be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary city taxes are collected, and such special assessments shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency, as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. (Ord. 657, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-11.10).

8.60.010 Title.
This chapter shall be known as the city of Millbrae tree protection and urban forestry program. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.01).

8.60.020 Findings.
Information obtained from two studies of the city’s street tree population indicates an undesirably large percentage of trees of one tree species; a sparse tree density based on the national average of trees per mile of street; and a decline in the number of tree species as a result of improper and inadequate tree maintenance and pruning. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.02).

8.60.030 Purposes and intent.
This chapter establishes policies, regulations and standards necessary to ensure the city will continue to realize the benefits provided by its urban forest. The purposes of this chapter are to:

A.    Establish and maintain the maximum amount of tree cover on public lands in the city;

B.    Maintain city trees in a healthy and nonhazardous condition through good arboricultural practices and community education programs;

C.    Establish and maintain appropriate diversity in tree species and age classes to provide a stable and sustainable urban forest;

D.    Promote and maintain the assessed values of private property for tax purposes; and

(Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.04).

8.60.050 Master tree plan – Regulations.
It is the policy of the city to implement a master tree plan, to encourage new tree planting of street trees, and to ensure a consistent and adequate program for the preservation and proper maintenance of the present street tree population.

The city council, by resolution, will adopt a master tree plan prescribing regulations on the care, preservation and proliferation of street trees in the city. A copy of this plan will be available for public inspection upon request, and all work performed on any street tree shall be in accordance with applicable regulations in said plan. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.05).

8.60.060 Property owner’s responsibility for street trees.
The city shall have ownership and control of all street trees now or hereafter in any street, including a parking strip within the city limits, but the property owner shall be responsible for the care and maintenance of such trees.

It shall be the duty and responsibility of all property owners to maintain street trees within parking strips fronting upon or abutting said owner’s property in a safe and healthy condition. This maintenance shall include watering as needed, and keeping such strips free from weeds or any obstructions contrary to public safety. All watering requirements shall be waived or modified to the extent they are inconsistent with governmental restrictions on water use. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impose any liability for injury or damages or a duty of care or maintenance upon the city or upon any of its officers or employees. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.06).

8.60.070 Work on street trees authorized by permit.
Unless authorized by permit, no person or property owner shall plant, prune, remove, alter or undertake any other work on a street tree. In addition to applicable regulations that may be adopted by the city council pursuant to MMC 8.60.050, this section governs the work or alteration of a street tree that may be authorized by permit.

A.    Pruning. Permits to prune street trees will authorize pruning in accordance with the following standards and methods:

1.    Removal of low-hanging branches, the existence of which interferes with visibility on, free use of, or access to any portion of any street, including sidewalks;

2.    Crown thinning, crown cleaning and the selective removal of branches, not to exceed thirty-three percent of the tree area, specifically for the purpose of increasing light penetration and air circulation within the crown;

3.    Removal of any deadwood;

4.    Maintenance of trunk and main lateral branches as well as the symmetrical appearance or natural shape of the tree.

The director may authorize by permit pruning standards and methods that exceed the restrictions specified above if the application presents unusual or justifiable circumstances warranting such an exception. Such circumstances may include particular conditions or qualities related to the street tree or the neighborhood, including consideration of the preservation of unique neighborhood characteristics, such as the restoration of a view or sunlight.

B.    Planting. Trees of a species recommended in the master tree plan may be planted in any street after obtaining a permit from the director.

C.    Removal. No removal of a street tree will be authorized or a permit issued therefor unless the applicant presents a compelling reason for the removal. Such reasons are as follows:

1.    The necessity to replace a tree, in order to preserve sunlight or a view, with a low growth form species;

2.    The necessity to remove the tree in order to construct any proposed improvements to allow economic enjoyment of the property;

3.    The necessity to remove the tree because it is dead or infected, and therefore presents a danger to the public or neighboring trees;

4.    The necessity to remove the tree because its roots are interfering with sewer or other utility lines or are damaging sidewalks in cases in which other mitigation methods are not reasonably feasible.

In each case of removal, the director also must make findings as to (1) whether there will be an adverse effect on erosion, soil retention and diversion or increased flow of surface waters as a result of the tree removal; and (2) the number of street trees existing in the neighborhood and the effect of the removal on the established tree standard in that area.

If a permit is issued for removal, the director will attach as a condition the applicant’s replacement of the street tree and designate on the permit the type of tree, as may be recommended by the applicant from the master tree plan. The director may designate another street tree planting site for the planting of the replacement tree. If a tree removal is authorized by permit, the department shall send a notice to the owners of property within three hundred feet of the applicant advising of the authorized tree removal and the reasons therefor.

D.    Public utility companies subject to the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission may perform pruning or other alteration of street trees, as is necessary, to comply with the safety regulations of said commission and to maintain the safe operation of their facilities. On an annual basis, such companies shall obtain a permit from the director and they shall notify the department at least three working days prior to undertaking any such pruning or other work on a street tree, except in cases of emergency. The director shall cause such pruning work to be inspected, when appropriate, to ensure that the pruning practices and procedures as referenced in this chapter and in the city’s master tree plan are followed. The director shall have the authority to stop any tree pruning or other work performed by a public utility company if such practices are not being followed. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.07).

8.60.080 Permit application.
Any property owner desiring to perform any work on or alter in any manner a street tree shall apply to the department for a permit. The application for a permit:

A.    Shall be made on forms provided by the department for this purpose;

B.    Shall describe the proposed work or alteration and the reasons for same;

C.    Shall be accompanied by a photo of the tree; and

D.    In the case of removal, shall specify the number and location of the trees to be removed by type and the reason for removal of each. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.08).

8.60.090 Permit review and decision.
A.    In addition to those factors set forth in MMC 8.60.070, the director will review each application to determine whether the proposed work (a) will create, continue or aggravate any hazardous condition or public nuisance; (b) will prevent or interfere with the growth, location or planting of street trees under the master tree plan; and (c) is otherwise consistent with the standards and regulations set forth in the master tree plan.

B.    The director will also consider the condition of the street tree with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures, and interference with utility facilities and services.

C.    The director shall issue a decision to grant or deny a permit within ten days of application. The permit shall be effective for a period of thirty days from the date that the permit decision becomes final and conclusive as set forth in MMC 8.60.100.

D.    The issuance of a permit pursuant to this chapter shall not create any liability of the city with regard to the work to be performed, and the applicant for such permit shall hold harmless the city, its officers and employees from any damage or injury that may occur in connection with or resulting from such work. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.09).

8.60.100 Appeal process.
A.    Any person may appeal the decision of the director to the city council by filing an appeal in writing with the city clerk no later than five p.m. on the tenth calendar day after the date the decision on the permit was issued. The city clerk shall set the matter for review by the city council at a regular council meeting scheduled within thirty days of the notice of appeal and provide notice by mail of the date, time, and place of the meeting to the appellant and the applicant at least seven days prior thereto.

B.    The determination of the director shall become final and conclusive on the eleventh calendar day following the date of the decision if no appeal is filed as specified above. Pruning, removal or any other work on a street tree authorized by permit shall not commence during the ten-day appeal period. If any appeal is filed, no work on a street tree authorized by permit may commence until the city council renders a decision on the appeal. The city council may affirm, revise or modify the director’s decision or remand the matter back to the director for further investigation and resolution. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.10).

8.60.110 Construction on parking strip prohibited.
Parking strips shall be used for landscape treatments only. It is unlawful to construct any improvements within the parking strip other than landscaping, provided that bricks, cobblestones or stepping stones may be placed in the parking strip for reasonable access to parked vehicles. Such bricks or stones shall be placed on earth and shall not be cemented or grouted in any fashion. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.11).

The director shall have the authority and responsibility to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.14).

8.60.150 Performance evaluation of program.
The department shall collect and maintain all records and data necessary to objectively evaluate whether progress is being made toward the stated goals of this chapter. An annual summary and analysis of the evaluation, and recommendations for action shall be prepared at the direction of the parks and recreation director and presented to the city council. The city council shall consider the report and recommendations and take such actions deemed necessary to accomplish the goals of this chapter. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.15).

8.60.160 Cooperation and coordination between city departments and other agencies.
A.

B.    The public works department and the parks and recreation department shall notify one another of approved public utility maintenance work on overhead wires, underground pipes or conduits, or such other facilities which may require removal of or alteration to a street tree, or cause any injury to street trees. (Ord. 598, § 2; 1976 Code § 8-12.16).

8.60.170 Penalties for violation.

This chapter shall be administered for the city by the city manager or designee. (Ord. 607, § 1, Amended by Ord. 698, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.04).

8.70.050 Construction and application.
This chapter shall be construed to assure consistency with the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act, as amended or supplemented, applicable implementing regulations and NPDES Permit No. CA 0029921 and any amendment, revision or reissuance of it. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.05).

8.70.060 Severability and validity.
If any portion of this chapter is declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions of this chapter are to be considered valid. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.06).

8.70.070 Waiver procedures.
A.    It is the intent of this chapter to protect and enhance water quality while respecting the rights of private property owners to economically viable use of land. It is not the intent of this chapter to prohibit all economically viable uses of any private lands, nor to result in a confiscatory impact. Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to provide for an administrative procedure for a waiver or modification of a particular provision of this chapter in the event the strict application of this chapter would result in the denial of all economically viable use of real property.

B.    An applicant for a waiver of a provision of this chapter shall file a waiver application with the director of public works on a form provided by the director identifying the provision sought to be waived or modified. The applicant shall file a complete form and shall provide all documentation and information required by the director to determine whether application of the provision in question will prohibit any economically viable use of the land in question or otherwise have an impermissible confiscatory result.

C.    The director may approve, deny or conditionally approve a waiver application upon making all of the following written findings:

1.    That the strict application of the provision for which a waiver or modification is sought would result in the denial of all economically viable use of the real property in question;

2.    To the maximum extent feasible, conditions have been placed upon such a waiver or modification in order to achieve the goals of this chapter as closely as possible while still allowing economically viable use of the real property in question; and

3.    Approval of such a waiver will not result in a public nuisance which would constitute a significant and direct threat to public health or safety. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.07).

8.70.080 Illicit discharge.
The discharge of non-storm water discharges to the city storm sewer system is prohibited. All discharges of material other than storm water must be in compliance with a NPDES permit issued for the discharge (other than NPDES permit No. CA 0029921) and this chapter. Any non-storm water discharge that is not allowed under a NPDES permit or this chapter is an illicit discharge. Establishment, maintenance or continuation of any illicit discharge and appurtenant connection to the city storm sewer system is prohibited. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.08).

8.70.090 Exceptions to discharge prohibition.
The following discharges are exempt from the prohibition set forth in MMC 8.70.080.

A.    The prohibition on discharges shall not apply to any discharge regulated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to the discharger and administered by the state of California under authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit and other applicable laws or regulations.

B.    Discharges from the following activities will not be considered a source of pollutants or supplemental runoff to waters of the United States when properly managed: water line flushing and other discharges from potable water sources, landscape irrigation and lawn watering, irrigation water, diverted stream flows, rising ground waters, infiltration to separate storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation and footing drains, water from crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, individual residential car washings, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges or flows from fire fighting and other emergency response activity. Accordingly these activities are not subject to the prohibition on discharges, unless determined to be a nuisance pursuant to Chapter 6.25 MMC or other applicable law. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.09).

8.70.100 Discharge in violation of permit.
Any discharge that would result in or contribute to a violation of NPDES Permit No. CA 0029921, the terms of which are incorporated by reference and which is on file in the office of the city clerk, and any amendment, revision or reissuance of it, either separately considered or when combined with other discharges, is prohibited. Liability for any such discharge shall be the responsibility of the person(s) causing or responsible for the discharge, and such persons shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city in any administrative or judicial enforcement action relating to such discharge. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.10).

8.70.110 Reduction of pollutants and supplemental runoff in storm water.
Any person engaged in activities which will or may result in pollutants or supplemental runoff entering the city storm sewer system shall undertake all practicable measures to reduce such pollutants or supplemental runoff. Examples of such activities include ownership and use of facilities which may be a source of pollutants such as parking lots, gasoline stations, industrial facilities, commercial facilities, stores fronting city streets, etc. Examples of supplemental runoff include calculated hydrologic increases in storm water runoff resulting from an increase in impervious surfaces due to construction or development, diversion of storm water runoff from naturally occurring tributaries, discharge of storm water detained through the use of detention facilities designed to change the rate of storm water flow from a development, or alteration of site runoff characteristics due to impervious pavements, structural modifications or landscaping alterations. The following minimal requirements shall apply:

A.    Littering. No person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain, keep or permit to be thrown, deposited, placed, left or maintained, any refuse, rubbish, garbage, or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles or accumulations, in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain, inlet, catch basin, conduit or other drainage structures, watercourse, business place or upon any public or private lot of land in the city, so that the same might be or become a pollutant, except in a manner lawfully established for the disposal of garbage.

The occupant or tenant, or in the absence of occupant or tenant, the owner, lessee, or proprietor of any real property in the city of Millbrae in front of which there is a paved sidewalk shall maintain the sidewalk free of litter to the maximum extent practicable. Sweepings from the sidewalk shall not be swept or otherwise made or allowed to go into the gutter or street, but shall be disposed of in a receptacle maintained on the property as required for the disposal of garbage.

No person shall throw or deposit litter in any fountain, pond, lake, stream or any other body of water in a park or elsewhere within the city.

B.    Standard for Parking Lots and Similar Structures. Persons owning or operating a parking lot, gas station pavement or similar structure shall clean those structures as frequently and thoroughly as practicable in a manner that does not result in discharge of pollutants or supplemental runoff to the city storm sewer system.

C.    Maintenance of Used Grease and Oil Containers. Any business maintaining an outdoor container for the collection and disposal of used cooking oil and grease shall provide a secured double containment system, suitable to contain the entire contents of the container in the event of leakage or vandalism. This double containment system shall be maintained in such condition that it avoids public health concerns and nuisances, including odors. Should any business fail to provide the necessary containment system and spillage of cooking oils or grease occurs, either accidentally or otherwise, that threatens the environment, then, in addition to all the enforcement mechanisms and penalties specified in Chapter 1.05 MMC, that business will be responsible to take all immediate measures to contain the spill from entering the city’s storm drain system and for cleanup of the spillage within four hours of learning of the spillage or of notification of a spill. If the business fails to clean up the spillage within four hours, the city will take action to have the spillage cleaned. The business will be responsible to pay or reimburse the city for all costs incurred as a result of the cleanup. A ten percent penalty will be added for each thirty day period for which the city is not reimbursed for these costs, and a business license renewal will not be granted to the business until these costs are paid in full.

D.    Best Management Practices for Development and Construction. Any construction contractor performing work in the city shall endeavor, whenever possible, to provide filter materials at the catch basin to retain any debris and dirt flowing into the city’s storm sewer system. The city may establish controls on the volume and rate of storm water runoff from new developments and redevelopments as may be appropriate to minimize the discharge and transport of pollutants or supplemental runoff.

E.    Compliance with Best Management Practices. When best management practices, plans, programs, guidelines or requirements have been adopted by the city for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to storm water pollution or contamination and/or discharge of non-storm water or supplemental runoff to the storm water system, every person undertaking such activity or operation, or owning or operating such facility shall comply with such plans, programs, guidelines or requirements as may be identified by the city. (Ord. 607, § 1, Amended by Ord. 694, §§ 1, 2; 1976 Code § 8-14.11).

8.70.120 Watercourse protection.
Except as modified or improved by the city, watercourses shall be maintained by adjacent property owners in a manner consistent with this chapter such that storm water flow is allowed to pass freely through a watercourse without obstruction. Watercourses shall include the entire riparian area of annual and ephemeral creeks, streams, channels and drainage ditches. The following provisions shall apply to protection of watercourses:

A.    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee or tenant, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other materials which would pollute, contaminate, obstruct or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. Any water control structures that are privately owned within a watercourse shall be maintained by the property owner so that the function of the watercourse is maintained.

B.    Healthy bank vegetation shall not be removed beyond that necessary for routine maintenance. Watercourse vegetation and erosion control facilities shall be maintained to prevent erosion of the watercourse and sedimentation of downstream portions of the watercourse.

C.    Any person planning a construction or maintenance activity that has the potential to cause erosion and sedimentation of a watercourse shall first apply for and be granted a grading permit from the city pursuant to the city grading ordinance at Chapter 9.45 MMC. Specific best management practices shall be applied to any such activity which mitigates the potential for erosion and sedimentation in accordance with policies and practices established by the department of public works.

D.    It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to engage in any of the following activities without first having obtained an approved grading permit from the city pursuant to the city grading ordinance (Chapter 9.45 MMC):

1.    Construct, alter, dam, divert or bridge any watercourse within the city;

2.    Damage, remove, disturb or destroy any improvements, structures, erosion control or sedimentation facilities within a watercourse; or

3.    Remove, mine, dredge or excavate any sand, gravel, soil or material of any kind from any watercourse. Any person desiring to remove an accumulation of sediment from a watercourse shall obtain a grading permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Millbrae grading ordinance. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.12).

8.70.130 Authority to inspect.

Any such request for entry and inspection shall state that the property owner or occupant has the right to refuse entry and that in the event such entry is refused, inspection may be made only upon issuance of a search warrant by a duly authorized magistrate. In the event the owner and/or occupant refuses entry after such request has been made, the official is hereby empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry.

Routine or area inspections shall be based upon such reasonable selection processes as may be deemed necessary to carry out the objectives of this chapter, including but not limited to random sampling and/or sampling in areas with evidence of storm water contamination, discharge of non-storm water to the storm water system or similar factors.

A.    Authority to Sample and Establish Sampling Devices. The city shall have the right to establish on any property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering operations. During all inspections, the official may take any samples deemed necessary to aid in the pursuit of the inquiry or in the recordation of the activities on-site. Unauthorized tampering, destruction or other interference with a sampling or monitoring device shall constitute a misdemeanor.

B.    Notification of Spills. As soon as any person in charge of a facility or responsible for emergency response for a facility has knowledge of any confirmed or unconfirmed release of materials, pollutants or waste which may result in pollutants or non-storm water discharges entering the city storm sewer system, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release and shall immediately notify the department of public works by telephone and Millbrae dispatch at 911 followed by a written confirmation of the notification within five days to the city of Millbrae, Department of Public Works, 621 Magnolia Avenue, Millbrae, California 94030, Attention: Director of Public Works.

C.    Requirement to Test or Monitor. Any authorized enforcement official may request that any person engaged in any activity and/or owning or operating any facility, which may cause or contribute to an illicit discharge and/or discharge of non-storm water to the storm water system, undertake such monitoring activities and/or analyses and furnish such reports as the official may specify. The recipient of such request shall undertake and provide the monitoring, analyses and/or reports requested and shall bear all related costs. The burden, including costs, of these activities, analyses and reports shall bear a reasonable relationship to the need for the monitoring, analyses and reports and the benefits to be obtained.

8.70.170 Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the penalties provided above, if any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to the public health, safety and welfare and is declared and deemed a nuisance that may be summarily abated and/or restored by any authorized enforcement official, then the city attorney may take civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance in accordance with Chapter 6.25 MMC. (Ord. 607, § 1; 1976 Code § 8-14.17).

8.70.180 Civil actions.

9.05.140 Findings.
A.    Health and Safety Code Sections 18941.5 and 17958.7 authorize the city to make more restrictive amendments that are reasonably necessary because of the local climatic, geological, and/or topographical conditions. The foregoing amendments to the building code are based on the following findings and local conditions which make the changes in the building code reasonably necessary:

1.    The unique characteristics of topography and the balance of industrial, commercial and residential property in the city of Millbrae require modifications to the California Building Code, to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents and property in the city by setting standards and requirements, and to give the city more control in ensuring these standards and requirements are met.

2.    Millbrae is located in an earthquake zone, has a moist climate, and the land throughout Millbrae involves large quantities of fill. Because of these and other factors, the land in the city is subject to instability. Furthermore, Millbrae generally has hilly terrain, high winds and buildings in close proximity to each other, which can increase the risk of the spreading of fires. Millbrae’s tight traffic patterns and poor access to fires limit fire fighting capabilities when fires start.

3.    More specifically, the amendments to the following sections of the building code are based on these particular findings:

a.    Section 1.8.4.5. This section has been added to balance the interests of construction contractors in performing construction contracts and the interests of the residents in the community from being disturbed in the early morning and late evening hours.

b.    Section 1.8.4.6. This section has been added to meet the requirements of the noise insulation standards established by the Federal Aviation Administration. The standards are intended to reduce the noise level produced from the San Francisco International Airport and to ensure that future residential new construction, additions and remodels comply with these standards.

c.    Section 1.8.4.7. This section has been added to meet the requirements of the consent decree between the city and the San Francisco Baykeeper with an effective date of November 15, 2010.

4.    Climatic Conditions. The city, on an average, experiences an annual rainfall of sixteen inches to eighteen inches. This rainfall can be expected between October and April of each year. However, during the summer months there is little, if any, measurable precipitation. During this dry period, the temperatures are usually between seventy and ninety degrees with light to gusty westerly winds. These drying winds mixed with natural vegetation and neighborhoods of predominately wood and wood shingle residential dwellings create a hazardous fuel condition. With more and more development, wind-driven fires would have severe consequences, as has been demonstrated on several occasions in other areas of the state.

Because of the weather patterns, a normal rainfall cannot always be relied upon. This can result in water rationing and water allocation systems, as demonstrated by the drought years of 1987 through 1989. Water shortages can also be expected in the future due to the current water storage capacities and increased consumption.

5.    Geological Conditions. The city’s western boundary is within a few miles of the San Andreas Fault, one of the major seismic faults running through California. An earthquake along the San Andreas Fault or along any of the other numerous seismic faults elsewhere in the Bay Area could break gas, electrical, and water lines, increasing the chance of fires and impairing the ability to fight them. Experts have cautioned that one or more major earthquakes in the Bay Area are inevitable and will probably happen sometime in the next several decades.

6.    Topographical Conditions. The findings of fact for the topographical elements, as would be expected, are closely associated with the geographical element. The elevation in the city changes from sea level on the east boundary to six hundred eighty-five feet on the west. Because of these elevation changes, narrow streets with steep grades weave through the upper residential sections of the city. On-street parking and excessive setbacks create long narrow driveways, which extend the response time of fire equipment and other emergency services.

As a result of the findings of fact which define the various climatic, geological, and topographical elements, those additional requirements as specified in these amendments by the city of Millbrae are considered reasonable and necessary modifications.

While it is clearly understood that the adoption of such regulations may not prevent the incidence of disasters, the implementation of these amendments to the code may reduce the severity and potential of loss of life and property. (Ord. 737, § 2, Amended by Ord. 762, § 2. Formerly 9.05.080).

9.10.120 Findings.
A.    Health and Safety Code Sections 18941.5 and 17958.7 authorize the City to make more restrictive amendments that are reasonably necessary because of the local climatic, geological, and/or topographical conditions. The foregoing amendments to the building code are based on the following findings and local conditions which make the changes in the building code reasonably necessary:

1.    The unique characteristics of topography and the balance of industrial, commercial and residential property in the city of Millbrae requires modifications to the residential code in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents and property in the city by setting standards and requirements, and to give the city more control in ensuring these standards and requirements are met.

2.    Millbrae is located in an earthquake zone, has a moist climate, and the land throughout Millbrae involves large quantities of fill.

9.30.180 Findings.
Health and Safety Code Sections 18941.5 and 17958.7 authorizes the city to make more restrictive amendments that are reasonably necessary because of the local climatic, geological, and/or topographical conditions. The foregoing amendments are based on the following findings and local conditions that make the changes in the fire code reasonably necessary:

A.    The unique characteristics of the topography and the balance of industrial, commercial and residential property in the city requires modifications to the 2016 fire code to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents and property in the city.

B.    Specific amendments more restrictive than in those adopted by the state of California have been established to address the fire problems, concerns and future direction by which the city can establish and maintain an environment which will afford a level of fire and life safety to all who live and work within its boundaries. These amendments are based on specific climatic, geographical, and topographical conditions present in the city, as more specifically described below:

1.    Climatic Conditions. The city, on an average, experiences an annual rainfall of sixteen inches to eighteen inches. This rainfall can be expected between October and April of each year. However, during the summer months there is little, if any, measurable precipitation. During this dry period, the temperatures are usually between seventy and ninety degrees with light to gusty westerly winds. These drying winds mixed with natural vegetation and neighborhoods of predominately wood and wood shingle residential dwellings create a hazardous fuel condition. With more and more development, wind-driven fires would have severe consequences, as has been demonstrated on several occasions in other areas of the state.

Because of the weather patterns, a normal rainfall cannot always be relied upon. This can result in water rationing and water allocation systems, as demonstrated by the drought years of 1987 through 1989. Water shortages can also be expected in the future due to the current water storage capacities and increased consumption.

2.    Geological Conditions. The city’s western boundary is within a few miles of the San Andreas Fault, one of the major seismic faults running through California. An earthquake along the San Andreas Fault or along any of the other numerous seismic faults elsewhere in the Bay Area could break gas, electrical, and water lines, increasing the chance of fires and impairing the ability to fight them. Experts have cautioned that one or more major earthquakes in the Bay Area are inevitable and will probably happen sometime in the next several decades.

3.    Topographical Conditions. The findings of fact for the topographical elements, as would be expected, are closely associated with the geographical element. The elevation in the city changes from sea level on the east boundary to six hundred eighty-five feet on the west. Because of these elevation changes, narrow streets with steep grades weave through the upper residential sections of the city. On-street parking and excessive setbacks create long narrow driveways, which extends the response time of fire equipment and other emergency services.

As a result of the findings of fact which define the various climatic, geological, and topographical elements, those additional requirements as specified in these amendments by the city of Millbrae are considered reasonable and necessary modifications.

While it is clearly understood that the adoption of such regulations may not prevent the incidence of disasters, the implementation of these amendments to the code may reduce the severity and potential of loss of life and property.

Said notice of determination shall be delivered by hand-delivery, telephone, telegram, facsimile, certified mail or other reasonable means, and shall clearly indicate that the structure or building is an imminent hazard and dangerous and that, as such, it constitutes a public nuisance. The notice shall set forth those factors which, in the opinion of the building official, make the structure an imminent hazard and dangerous, and shall also include a directive from the building official of the specific action or actions to be taken by the property owner. The notice shall specify that within forty-eight hours from the time of delivery of the notice of determination, the owner or other party of record with an equitable or legal interest in said property shall abate the nuisance in accordance with the directives written in the notice of determination by the building official.

B.    Summary Abatement. If a structure or building is an imminent or immediate danger to the health, welfare or safety of the public that must be abated immediately, the building official or fire chief may cause the nuisance to be abated by the city with city resources or city contractors. The city may summarily abate such a nuisance without giving prior notice or a hearing. Reasonable attempts to contact the property owner shall be made.

C.    Appeal of Notice of Determination.

1.    A notice of determination delivered by the building official that a building or structure is an imminent hazard and dangerous and therefore must be abated, may be appealed by the property owner or any other party of record with an equitable or legal interest in said property. Such appeal must be made to the building official within forty-eight hours of delivery of such notice of determination by the building official. Such appeal shall be accompanied by a written hazard abatement plan signed by a state of California licensed engineer or architect or by a written report by a state of California licensed engineer or architect stating why the engineer or architect feels the building or structure is not an imminent hazard or dangerous at this time. Such report shall include a recommendation by the engineer or architect as to what should and/or should not be done at this time. If the building official accepts the proposed hazard abatement plan in lieu of the notice of determination, the hazard abatement plan must be implemented within forty-eight hours of acceptance by the building official. If the building official accepts an engineer’s or architect’s report and agrees there is no imminent hazard, the building official shall rescind in writing the former notice of determination.

2.    Should the building official disagree with the hazard abatement plan, or should the building official disagree with the engineer’s or architect’s report, a hearing shall be conducted within forty-eight hours by a board of appeals to be constituted of individual(s) other than the building official.

D.    City of Millbrae, Board of Appeals Hearing.

1.    At the hearing, the appellant shall have the right to call witnesses, submit evidence and to cross-examine the witnesses of the city. All witnesses shall be sworn.

2.    A record of the entire proceedings shall be made by tape recording. The hearing will not be conducted in accordance with the formal rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence may be submitted regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in the courts of this state.

3.    At the close of this hearing, the board of appeals shall act to either uphold, overrule or modify the determination and order of the building official. The determination and order of the building official shall be upheld, unless the board of appeals finds, based upon evidence in the record, that the building official erred in determining that the structure is an imminent hazard and dangerous. The decision and reasoning of the board of appeals may be given orally on the record. If given orally, the decision shall be memorialized in writing and served upon the applicant within forty-eight hours of the time the oral decision is rendered.

4.    If the board of appeals upholds the decisions of the building official, the property owner(s) of record shall be ordered to abate the public nuisance within the time set forth in the order. If the structure is determined not to be a danger to public safety, the building official’s determination and order shall be vacated. The decision of the board of appeals shall be final on the date it is rendered.

E.    Hazard Abatement Plan.

1.    If a hazard abatement plan is approved by the building official, the owner or other interested party of record shall proceed to execute such plan within forty-eight hours of obtaining approval of the plan from the building official. Within twenty-four hours of completion of the abatement work, the owner or other interested party of record shall provide the building official with a written certification that the public nuisance, as described in the building official’s notice of determination, has been abated.

2.    If the work performed pursuant to the hazard abatement plan amounts to temporary abatement, the owner or other party of record, prior to proceeding with permanent repairs, shall obtain the required permits and file a damage assessment report with the building official. The damage assessment report shall be reviewed and approved by the building official before permanent repairs are performed.

F.    Failure to Perform. In those instances where the property owner or other interested party of record either does not respond to the building official’s notice of determination or an approved hazard abatement plan, responds untimely or responds timely but fails to abate the public nuisance within the required time period, the imminent hazard and dangerous structures may be subject to summary abatement by the city pursuant to subsection (B) of this section.

G.    Suspension of Abatement Work. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the building official is authorized to suspend abatement work by the city, or the city’s contractors, and to allow the property owner or other party of legal interest to complete the abatement work.

H.    Change of Status. When the conditions making a structure an imminent hazard and dangerous have been abated, the structure shall no longer be considered an imminent hazard and dangerous. However, if the abatement work is temporary in nature, as determined by the building official, the structure shall remain subject to the provisions of this chapter.

I.    If the owner of any building or structure has decided to demolish rather than repair, the owner, or the owner’s representative, shall obtain a demolition permit. (Ord. 623, § 1; 1976 Code § 9-16.06).

9.80.070 Hazard abatement of historic buildings or structures.
A.

1.    Whenever possible, as determined by the building official, the building or structure may be braced or shored in such a manner as to mitigate the hazard to public health or safety or the hazard to the public right-of-way.

2.    Whenever bracing or shoring is determined to be an unreasonable alterative, the building official may cause the building or structure to be condemned and immediately demolished. Such condemnation and demolition may be performed in the interest of public health or safety without a condemnation hearing as required by MMC 9.70.010.

B.    If, ten days after the event and less than thirty days after the event, an historic building or structure is determined by the building official to represent a hazard to health or safety of the public or to pose a threat to the public right-of-way, the building official may initiate condemnation proceedings in accordance with MMC 9.70.010. The building official shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, of its intent to hold a condemnation hearing.

A.    The boundaries of the districts designated and established by MMC 10.05.0300 and 10.05.0310 are shown on that map entitled, “Zoning Map of the City of Millbrae,” which map is incorporated in and made a part of this chapter. An official copy of said map shall be kept by the city clerk of the city for the purpose, among other things, of performing the duties prescribed by MMC 10.05.0340. The districts shown on said map are declared to be subject to the regulations pertaining to such designated districts as said regulations are set forth in this chapter. All notations, references and other information shown on the zoning map are incorporated by reference and shall be deemed as much a part of this title as if the matter and information set forth by the map were fully described in this chapter.

B.    No person shall use any land or structure, nor shall any structure be erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, moved or used in any district shown on said zoning map, except in accordance with the regulations established by this chapter for the district in which it is located.

C.    The boundaries of any district included in the zoning map incorporated in this chapter shall be determined by reference to that zoning map dated December 6, 1949, adopted by Section 2.2 of Ordinance No. 42 of the city and subsequent amendments to such map.

After adoption of any ordinance changing any boundaries of any district, the city clerk shall mark the aforementioned map to show the number and date of the adoption of this chapter, and annually thereafter, the city clerk shall cause a revised zoning map to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, said map to show the changes made in district boundaries effected by amending ordinances as provided in this chapter for the year preceding said publication; provided, however, that no publication shall be required if there have been no such changes during the preceding year. However, district boundary lines shall be deemed to automatically change with changes to lot boundaries as a result of city-approved lot line adjustments. (Ord. 231, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.306; 1966 Code § 7804. Formerly 10.05.0100).

In addition, prior to the issuance of any new permit on a property, any existing uses or structures on that property for which a permit is required but was not approved, or for which regulations exist but have not been complied with, shall be removed or made compliant so that a permit, if required, can be approved; with the exception that legal nonconforming uses and structures are exempt from this provision but are subject to the provisions of Article XXIV of this chapter.

C.    Findings. The city manager (or designee) shall make all of the following findings in order to grant an exception for minor improvements for disabled access:

1.    The proposed improvements are necessary to provide for housing access for disabled persons.

2.    The proposed exception(s) will cause no significant negative environmental impacts to the applicant’s property, adjacent properties, or to the surrounding neighborhood and community.

3.    The proposed exception(s) will cause no significant negative impacts on the privacy of the applicant or adjacent neighbors. (Ord. 748, § 3).

10.05.0430 State density bonus law.
A.    Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to specify how compliance with Government Code Section 65915 (“state density bonus law”) will be implemented in an effort to encourage the production of low income housing units in developments proposed within the city.

B.    Applicability.

1.    This chapter shall apply to all zoning districts, including mixed use zoning districts, where residential developments of five or more dwelling units are proposed and where the applicant seeks and agrees to provide low, very low, senior or moderate income housing units in the threshold amounts specified in state density bonus law such that the resulting density is beyond that which is permitted by the applicable zoning. This chapter and state density bonus law shall apply only to the residential component of a mixed-use project and shall not operate to increase the allowable density of the nonresidential component of any proposed project.

2.    Nothing in this chapter requires the provision of direct financial incentives for the residential development, including but not limited to the provision of financial subsidies, publicly owned land, fee waivers, or waiver of dedication requirements. The city at its sole discretion may choose to provide such direct financial incentives.

3.    Financial and certain other incentives may require payment of prevailing wages by the residential development if required by state law.

4.    Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the definitions found in state density bonus law shall apply to the terms contained herein.

C.    Procedure.

1.    Application Requirements.

a.    Any applicant requesting a density bonus, incentive(s) and/or waiver(s) pursuant to state density bonus law shall provide the city with a written proposal. The proposal shall be submitted prior to or concurrently with filing the planning application for the housing development and shall be processed in conjunction with the underlying application.

b.    The proposal for a density bonus, incentive(s) and/or waiver(s) pursuant to state density bonus law shall include the following information:

i.    The specific requested density bonus proposal shall demonstrate that the project meets the thresholds for the state density bonus law. The proposal shall also include calculations showing the maximum base density, the number/percentage of affordable units and identification of the income level at which such units will be restricted, additional market rate units resulting from the density bonus allowable under state density bonus law and the resulting unit per acre density. The density bonus units shall not be included in determining the percentage of base units that qualify a project for a density bonus pursuant to state density bonus law.

ii.    Requested Incentive(s). The request for particular incentive(s) shall include a pro forma or other report demonstrating that the requested incentive(s) results in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions that are necessary to make the housing units economically feasible. The report shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the city to verify its conclusions. If the city requires the services of specialized financial consultants to review and corroborate the analysis, the applicant will be liable for all costs incurred in reviewing the documentation.

iii.    Requested Waiver(s). The written proposal shall include an explanation of the waiver(s) of development standards requested and why they are necessary to make the construction of the project physically possible. Any requested waiver(s) shall not exceed the limitations provided by subsection (C)(5) of this section and to the extent such limitations are exceeded will be considered as a request for an incentive.

iv.    Fee. Payment of the fee in an amount set by resolution of the city council to reimburse the city for staff time spent reviewing and processing the state density bonus law application submitted pursuant to this chapter.

2.    Density Bonus.

a.    A density bonus for a housing development means a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning and land use designation on the date the application is deemed complete. The amount of the allowable density bonus shall be calculated as provided in state density bonus law. The applicant may select from only one of the income categories identified in the state density bonus law and may not combine density bonuses from different income categories to achieve a larger density bonus.

b.    In the sole discretion of the city council, the city council may approve a density bonus and/or incentive(s) in accordance with state density bonus law for a project that does not maximize the underlying base zoning density. Additionally, nothing herein prevents the city from granting a greater density bonus and additional incentives or waivers than that provided for herein, or from providing a lesser density bonus and fewer incentives and waivers than that provided for herein, when the housing development does not meet the minimum thresholds.

c.    The density bonus provided pursuant to state density bonus law is not additive with and shall not be combined with the density bonus provided pursuant to any other provisions of this chapter.

3.    Incentives.

a.    The number of incentives granted shall be based upon the number the applicant is entitled to pursuant to state density bonus law.

b.    An incentive includes a reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural requirements that result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. An incentive may be the approval of mixed use zoning (e.g., commercial) in conjunction with a housing project if the mixed use will reduce the cost of the housing development and is compatible with the housing project. An incentive may, but need not be, the provision of a direct financial incentive, such as the waiver of fees.

c.    A requested incentive may be denied only for those reasons provided in state density bonus law. Denial of an incentive is a separate and distinct act from a decision to deny or approve the entirety of the project.

4.    Discretionary Approval. The granting of a density bonus or incentive(s) shall not be interpreted in and of itself to require a general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval. If an incentive would otherwise trigger one of these approvals, when it is granted as an incentive, no general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval is required. However, if the base project without the incentive requires a general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval, the city retains discretion to make or not make the required findings for approval of the base project.

5.    Waivers. A waiver is a modification to a development standard such that construction at the increased density would be physically possible. Modifications to floor area ratio in an amount equivalent to the percentage density bonus utilized shall be allowable as a waiver. Requests for an increase in floor area ratio above that equivalent percentage shall be considered a request for an incentive. Other development standards include, but are not limited to, a height limitation, a setback requirement, an on-site open space requirement, or a parking ratio that applies to a residential development. An applicant may request a waiver of any development standard to make the project physically possible to construct at the increased density. To be entitled to the requested waiver, the applicant must show that without the waiver, the project would be physically impossible to construct. There is no limit on the number of waivers.

6.    Local Preference for Type of Incentives and Concessions. The allocation of incentives or a density bonus shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the approval body in approving the affordable housing plan or equivalent in consideration of the following preferred measures:

a.    A waiver and/or modification to the floor area ratio (FAR) or height requirements are the city’s preferred alternatives.

b.    A reduction in parking standards beyond that set forth in Government Code Section 65915(p) will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The request shall be accompanied by evidence demonstrating that the city’s parking standards physically preclude the utilization of a density bonus or that the project needs for parking can be met due to other factors.

c.    A reduction in on-site open space requirements is discouraged unless nearby off-site open space and/or enhancements thereto can be demonstrated to the city’s satisfaction to meet project needs.

d.    A waiver of or reduction in application fees is not preferred but will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

7.    Affordable Housing Agreement. Prior to project approval, the applicant shall enter into an affordable housing agreement or equivalent with the city, to be executed by the approving body guaranteeing the affordability of the rental or ownership units for a minimum of fifty-five years and identifying the type, size and location of each affordable unit and a marketing plan for finding qualified tenants and owners. Such affordable housing agreement shall be recorded in the San Mateo County recorder’s office.

8.    Design and Quality.

a.    Affordable units must be constructed concurrently with market rate units and shall be integrated into the project. Affordable units shall be of equal design and quality as the market rate units. Exteriors, including architecture and elevations, and floor plans of the affordable units shall be similar to the market rate units. Interior finishes and amenities may differ from those provided in the market rate units, but neither the workmanship nor the products may be of substandard or inferior quality as determined by the building official. The number of bedrooms in the affordable units shall be consistent with the mix of market rate units.

b.    Parking standards shall be modified as allowable under state density bonus law and anything beyond those standards shall be considered a request for an incentive.

D.    Findings.

1.    Findings for Approval of State Mandated Density Bonus, Concessions, and Incentives. Before approving an application that includes a request for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, the decision-making body shall make the following findings, as applicable:

a.    The residential development is eligible for a density bonus and any concessions, incentives, waivers, or parking reductions requested.

b.    Any requested incentive or concession will result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions based upon appropriate financial analysis and documentation if required.

c.    If the density bonus is based all or in part on donation of land, the findings included in Government Code Section 65915(g).

d.    If the density bonus, incentive, or concession is based all or in part on the inclusion of a childcare facility, the findings included in Government Code Section 65915(h).

e.    If the incentive or concession includes mixed-use development, the findings included in Government Code Section 65915(k)(2).

f.    If a waiver is requested, the development standards for which a waiver is requested would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the residential development with the density bonus, concessions, or incentives permitted.

2.    Findings for Denial of Incentives, Concessions or Waivers.

a.    If the findings required by subsection (D)(1) of this section can be made, the decision-making body may deny a concession or incentive only if it makes a written finding, supported by substantial evidence, of either of the following:

i.    The concession or incentive is not required to provide for affordable rents or affordable ownership costs.

ii.    The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact upon public health or safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households. For the purpose of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application for the residential development was deemed complete.

iii.    The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law.

b.    If the findings required by subsection (D)(1) of this section can be made, the decision-making body may deny a waiver only if it makes a written finding, supported by substantial evidence, of either of the following:

i.    The waiver would have a specific adverse impact upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households. For the purpose of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, and identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete.

ii.    The waiver would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.

iii.    The waiver would be contrary to state or federal law.

c.    If the findings required by subsection (D)(1) of this section can be made, the decision-making body may deny a density bonus, incentive, or concession that is based on the provision of childcare facilities only if it makes a written finding, based on substantial evidence, that the city already has adequate childcare facilities. (Ord. 752, § 2).

Article V. Single-Family Residential Large Lot or “R-1LL” District

10.05.0500 Purpose.
The purpose of the single-family residential large lot or “R-1LL” district is to provide for detached single-family residential development of the hillside lands in Millbrae for relatively low densities commensurate with the natural topography, tree cover, and surface drainage patterns which typify those areas. This district correlates with the “very low density residential” land use designation of the Millbrae General Plan. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.0510 Uses.
The following uses shall be permitted, conditional, or accessory uses in the R-1LL district:

A.    Permitted uses: single-family dwellings and state-regulated residential care facilities.

B.    Conditional uses: places of worship, schools (pre-K and K through twelve), country clubs, golf courses, parks, utility services, wireless communications facilities, and bed and breakfasts.

C.    Accessory uses: home occupations, short-term residential rentals. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A), Amended by Ord. 771, § 4(C)).

10.05.0520 Development standards.
Development regulations in the R-1LL district are as follows:

A.    Lot Minimums.

1.    Width:

a.    Fifty feet for interior lots.

b.    Sixty feet for corner lots.

2.    Area: ten thousand square feet.

B.    Lot Maximums.

1.    Lot coverage: forty percent.

2.    Floor area ratio (FAR): fifty-five percent. FAR is as defined in Article II of this chapter and shall also include the following:

a.    The floor area of a room with a ceiling greater than nine feet in height shall be calculated as the product of the overall height multiplied by the horizontal floor area and divided by eight; however, in cases where the ceiling slopes at three to twelve or greater, the uppermost five feet will be excluded from the calculation.

b.    Crawlspace area greater than two feet above exterior grade will be counted by multiplying the horizontal floor area by the average height of the area, as determined by the height of the finished floor above to the respective corner exterior grade of the building, deducting two feet to allow for typical height of crawlspace and floor joists, and dividing by eight; however, no negative crawlspace area calculation will be considered.

c.    In an attic with a roof slope of three to twelve or greater, only the portion of the floor area with a ceiling height of five feet or greater shall be counted.

d.    The area of atriums, covered and enclosed courtyards, and all covered decks and balconies shall be counted.

e.    The area of all decks and balconies with a floor height above finished grade of seven feet or more shall be counted.

f.    One-half of the area of covered patios, decks and balconies with a floor height less than seven feet above finished grade shall be counted.

g.    The area of unenclosed front entry porches, and portions thereof, at least ten feet deep shall be counted.

h.    FAR exceptions may be granted by the planning commission in the manner provided in Article XXV of this chapter for residences on lots with slopes of thirty percent or greater where total FAR, based upon the net lot area, exceeds fifty-five percent.

i.    FAR exceptions may be granted by the planning commission in the manner provided in Article XXV of this chapter for residences on lots with a cumulative easement area of more than ten percent of gross lot area where total FAR, based upon net lot area, exceeds fifty-five percent.

C.    Height.

1.    Maximum height of structures shall be thirty feet, provided the uppermost five feet shall consist of a roof which slopes toward any adjacent street at a minimum slope of three inches per foot. If the slope is less than three inches per foot, the maximum height shall be twenty-five feet.

2.    Exceptions. Upon securing a height exception, chimneys, silos, cupolas, flagpoles, monuments, gas storage holders, radio and other towers, church steeples, and similar structures and mechanical appurtenances may exceed the height limit; provided, that the front, side, and rear setbacks shall each be increased by one foot for each one foot of additional height allowed.

3.    All other structures exceeding the maximum allowable height shall require a variance.

D.    Setbacks.

1.    Ground Floor Setbacks.

Front: twenty feet.

Side:

Five feet interior; however, the width of interior side yards may be reduced to ten percent of the lot width, but in no case to less than three feet.

Ten feet exterior.

Rear: ten feet.

a.    Attached ground floor decks greater than one foot above adjacent grade shall meet the above specified setbacks.

b.    Residential garage entrances fronting on any exterior lot line shall be located not less than twenty feet from said line, except for alley frontages where the setback may be less than twenty feet; provided, that adequate vehicular maneuvering area is available.

c.    The exterior yard on the rear thirty feet of a side fronting lot shall not be less than the front yard required or existing on the first lot to its rear.

d.    Where a dwelling unit is located on a lot so that the main entrance is located on the side of the building, the required side setback, from the front setback line to such entrance, shall be not less than ten feet.

e.    The width of the interior side yard for lots with single-family dwellings may be reduced to ten percent of the width of the lot, but in no case to less than three feet.

2.    Upper Floor Setbacks.

a.    For lots at least fifty-five feet wide (as measured at the minimum twenty-foot front setback line).

i.    Front: ten feet more than the distance of the exterior building walls below so that the second floor parallels the ground floor at all points along the front facade.

ii.    Side: ten feet more than the distance of the exterior building walls below; however, this setback may be reduced by two feet for each one foot that the ground floor setback exceeds the five-foot minimum, for a maximum reduction of six feet.

b.    For lots at least forty-five feet but less than fifty-five feet wide (as measured at the minimum twenty-foot front setback line).

i.    Front: ten feet more than the distance of the exterior building walls below so that the second floor parallels the ground floor at all points along the front facade.

ii.    Side: seven feet more than the distance of the exterior building walls below; however, this setback may be reduced by one foot for each one foot that the ground floor setback exceeds the five-foot minimum, for a maximum reduction of three feet.

c.    For lots less than forty-five feet wide (as measured at the minimum twenty-foot front setback line).

i.    Front: ten feet more than the distance of the exterior building walls below so that the second floor parallels the ground floor at all points along the front facade.

ii.    Side: five feet more than the distance of the exterior building walls below; however, this setback may be reduced by one foot for each one foot that the ground floor setback exceeds the five-foot minimum, for a maximum reduction of two feet.

d.    Upper floor encroachments beyond those described above are permissible only upon the securing of a setback exception from the planning commission in the manner provided in Article XXV of this chapter.

3.    Encroachments Permissible without Planning Commission Approval.

a.    Architectural features on the main building, such as cornices, eaves, canopies, fireplaces, and bay windows, may project not closer than three feet to any interior side lot line and not more than two feet into any required front, rear, or exterior side yard.

b.    Open, uncovered raised porches, landings, or outside stairways may project not closer than three feet to any interior side lot line, not more than two feet into any required exterior side yard, and not more than six feet into any required front or rear yard.

E.    Density Limit. The minimum lot area per unit shall be ten thousand square feet.

F.    Parking.

1.    The parking requirements for all permitted, conditional, and accessory uses in the R-1LL district are listed in MMC 10.05.2100 (the “parking requirements table”).

2.    A minimum of two side-by-side garage parking spaces are required for each single-family dwelling. Single-family dwellings originally constructed with only one garage parking space and which were built prior to adoption of the two-space requirement shall receive consideration for alternative solutions (per the “single-family parking guidelines”) to this parking requirement, such as tandem garage parking and dedicated surface parking, when garage expansion for side-by-side parking is not feasible. A carport shall not be constructed in lieu of a required garage space, but code compliant and legally permitted carports existing prior to October 13, 2009, shall count as required parking. However, should any carport be removed, it shall not be rebuilt.

G.    Other Provisions.

1.    There shall be one thousand square feet of open and uncovered space in the rear one-third of the lot area.

2.    Not less than sixty percent of the front yard shall be landscaped (as defined in Article II of this chapter) with the exception that all site improvements required to provide disabled accessibility, to the extent not feasible in nonlandscaped areas, may extend into the required landscaped area. The remainder of the front yard may be used for vehicular parking or storage; however, all vehicular parking and storage areas shall be surfaced in compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

Article VI. Single-Family Residential or “R-1” District

10.05.0600 Purpose.
The purpose of the single-family residential or “R-1” district is to stabilize and protect the detached single-family residential character that comprises most of Millbrae and to promote and encourage a high-quality physical environment best suited for family life on a traditional neighborhood basis. This district correlates with the “low density residential” land use designation of the Millbrae General Plan. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.0610 Uses.
The following uses shall be permitted, conditional or accessory uses in the R-1 district:

B.    Where any land is to be conveyed for public use, a title report issued by a title insurance company in the name of the owner of the land, issued to or for the benefit and protection of the city, showing all parties whose consent is necessary and the nature of their interests therein, shall be filed with the conveyances of said land.

C.    Where public improvements are to be constructed or where improvements are to be made upon lands to be conveyed to the city, the landowner shall execute and file an agreement with the city providing for the installation of such improvements at the landowner’s cost and expense, and in accordance with the approved development schedule contained in the development plan. The agreement shall be accompanied by labor, material and performance bonds. Such improvement agreement and bonds provided for in this chapter shall be considered in a like manner as are requirements upon improvement agreements and bonds under regulations for subdivisions in the city. Such improvement agreement and bonds shall be deemed to include and cover the installation of landscaping and planting as required by any approved plan thereof, whether such landscaping and planting shall be upon public or private lands.

Article XVI. Grand Boulevard Planned Development or “GBPD” District

10.05.1600 Purpose.
The Grand Boulevard Planned Development or “GBPD” district is intended to facilitate intensified redevelopment of the El Camino Real corridor through pedestrian-oriented, transit-oriented, mixed-use projects. It enables the use of regulations that are more flexible than those contained elsewhere in this chapter. When applied to individual sites, this district grants variability in the size and placement of structures and other site improvements while protecting public health, safety, welfare, comfort, and convenience. This article establishes the procedures for securing the Grand Boulevard Planned Development zoning classification and for reviewing development plans for any project proposal for “GBPD” zoning. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1605 Size.
The Grand Boulevard Planned Development District may be established on a parcel of any size, provided it has direct frontage along El Camino Real. One or more contiguous parcels, also of any size, may be merged with a parcel having direct frontage along El Camino Real to form a GBPD district. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1610 Uses and conceptual development plan.
Any use consistent with the Millbrae General Plan may be permitted, provided such use exists or has been designated in a conceptual development plan as specified in MMC 10.05.1620 and approved by the city council pursuant to provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1615 Initiation of zoning district.
Initiation of a change of zoning district to Grand Boulevard Planned Development district shall be made by the city council, the parcel owner(s) or their authorized agent in the manner provided in Article XXVIII of this chapter and shall be based upon a conceptual development plan as specified in MMC 10.05.1620. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1620 Conceptual development plan requirements.
A.    The conceptual development plan for a Grand Boulevard Planned Development district shall depict the proposed development concept in sufficient detail so as to enable the city council to render a zoning decision. The conceptual development plan shall be in the form of one or more maps and other materials describing or showing all of the following:

1.    The site proposed for planned development including its size and perimeter dimensions;

2.    The location and dimension of any existing property lines within the site;

3.    Contact information of the owner(s) and developer(s) of the site;

4.    The width, location, and names of surrounding or adjoining streets, as well as any proposed street alignments within the site and their connection to existing streets;

5.    The character, use, and density/intensity of all abutting and all street-adjacent properties;

6.    The existing and proposed topography of the site displayed at not less than two-foot contour intervals;

7.    The locations and capacities of existing utilities in the vicinity of the site including any proposed or required extensions to the site;

8.    The location of any structure(s) existing upon the site designated for retention or removal and the proposed location of future structure(s);

9.    Areas of the site proposed for various categories of land use (such as residential, commercial, parking, circulation, recreation, and open space), development standards for each proposed land use (such as building heights and setbacks, dwelling units per acre and/or floor area ratio, and parking standards), and a tabular summary of estimates of the resulting population densities and/or building intensities;

10.    Architectural sketches of all proposed buildings, design guidelines to achieve the proposed architectural concepts, and the intended use of all proposed buildings;

11.    Conceptual landscape plan indicating areas of hardscape, softscape, and other proposed amenities;

12.    A narrative description of all proposed site improvements; and

13.    The data, analyses, and supporting information required to carry out the environmental review specified in subsection B of this section.

B.    Prior to submission of the development plan to the planning commission, an environmental review of the plan shall be conducted to the extent required by and in full accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act.

C.    The planning commission and city council may require such other information as deemed necessary which may include but not be limited to economic analyses, thoroughfare plans, public services, facilities plans and utilities services plans. All of the information and materials required for any development plan as specified in subsections A and B of this section shall be at the applicant’s own cost and expense. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1625 Action on change of zoning.
A.    The planning commission and city council shall consider the proposed change of zoning district and shall take such action as deemed suitable in accordance with the provisions of Article XXVIII. If the city council approves the conceptual development plan and zone change, the GBPD zone shall be indicated on the official zoning map of the city; however, no development of the site of the Grand Boulevard Planned Development district shall be undertaken until an application for a precise development plan as described in MMC 10.05.1640 has been approved by the planning commission pursuant to MMC 10.05.1650.

B.    In approving any petition for a GBPD district, the planning commission and city council shall make the following findings:

1.    The requested GBPD zone is consistent with the Millbrae General Plan;

2.    The development standards of the requested GBPD zone will provide adequate protection for the surrounding land uses; and

3.    The design guidelines of the requested GBPD zone will assure architectural compatibility with the surrounding area and/or will set a high standard of architectural quality for the surrounding area. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1630 Amendment of the conceptual development plan.
The approval of any development plan for a Grand Boulevard Planned Development district may be modified or amended by ordinance in the manner provided in Article XXVIII of this chapter in the same manner as for the institution of the Grand Boulevard Planned Development district upon any land. Such procedures may be initiated by the owners of the lands affected, by the planning commission, or by the city council; provided, that any change initiated by the planning commission or the city council shall be commenced by the adoption of a resolution of intention, in the manner provided in Article XXVIII of this chapter. The change or changes shall cause a map of the proposed modifications or amendments to be prepared by the developer and filed with the planning commission in the same manner as a petition for amendment is filed in the manner provided in Article XXVIII of this chapter. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1635 Phasing of conceptual development plan.
Where it appears that the area proposed for Grand Boulevard Planned Development zoning is of considerable extent, the petition for rezoning shall specify upon the conceptual development plan a phasing schedule providing for completion and presentation of separate plans for each part. Upon approval of this phasing schedule by the city council, the developer shall cause the precise development plan for each part to be prepared and submitted in accordance with such schedule. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the planning commission or city council to accept precise development plans in stages or phases except as heretofore provided. The planning commission and city council may, if they so determine, require that a precise development plan or a part thereof shall be submitted for approval at the same time the conceptual development plan is filed with a petition requesting Grand Boulevard Planned Development district zoning. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1640 Application for precise development plan.
Following approval of the conceptual development plan of any Grand Boulevard Planned Development district, the petitioner shall submit to the planning commission a precise development plan or, in the event of the approval of a phasing schedule of precise development plans as described in MMC 10.05.1635, the first phase of such precise development plan. Any proposed use involving a new structure or new parking facility, or exterior alterations to an existing building, shall be subject to design review pursuant to MMC 10.05.1650. The application shall be accompanied by required fees and plans showing the details of the proposed use. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.1645 Precise development plan requirements.
Precise development plans shall be detailed refinements of the development concept and as such shall represent development consistent with the approved conceptual development plan. Precise development plans shall, at a minimum, contain the following:

A.    A comprehensive site plan showing the location, size, and dimensions of all proposed structures (such as buildings, fences, and related appurtenances), streets, parking, open spaces, and service areas/facilities. Such plan shall include a detailed statement of all land uses to be established, the areas to be occupied by each use, and the resulting residential densities and/or nonresidential building intensities;

B.    Detailed engineering site plans including proposed finished grades, drainage facilities as approved by the city engineer, and permanent boundary survey monuments tied to the nearest city survey station;

C.    A detailed landscape plan depicting all existing plant materials (by species, size, and condition) designated for retention or removal, all proposed plant materials (by species, size, and quantity), and any other amenities (such as water features, seating, and decorative lighting);

D.    A master sign program describing in detail, in both narrative and graphic form, the size, type, color, material, font, and placement of all permanent signage, as well as provisions for temporary signs;

6.    That capacity of utilities and infrastructure, including size and location of streets and sidewalks, are adequate or will be installed/improved to an adequate level prior to the granting of a certificate of occupancy; and

7.    That recreation is adequately provided for in the area (or adequate in-lieu fees are paid).

D.    If a site development plan is approved by the planning commission, the approval shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of final approval thereof or within any shorter or longer period of time not to exceed three years, if so designated by the planning commission. The planning commission shall have the authority to extend the period of any approval provided that a written request for such extension is submitted prior to the date of expiration of the original approval and a notice of hearing has been given in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX of this chapter. Any approvals granted in accordance with the terms of this chapter shall, without further action, become null and void if not used or extended according to these provisions. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 643, § 3; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)05. Formerly 10.05.0530).

10.05.1725 Appeal, appeal period and acknowledgment of conditions.
If a site development plan, or extension thereof, is approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved by the planning commission, the applicant or any protestant may appeal the decision of the planning commission to the city council in the manner provided in Article XXVII of this chapter. Notwithstanding the failure of any person to appeal the decision of the planning commission and within ten days of the date of the action of the planning commission, the city council, or any member thereof, may request a review of the action of the planning commission. Said request for review shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk. City council review shall proceed in the manner provided in Article XXVII of this chapter. The action of the planning commission shall be suspended pending a final determination by the city council. In any case, permits shall not be issued until the required ten-day period has elapsed without the filing of an appeal or a final decision has been made by the city council. Approvals shall have no force or effect until the applicant acknowledges receipt thereof and acceptance of any conditions thereto. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 643, § 3; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)06. Formerly 10.05.0540).

10.05.1730 Modification of site development plans.
A.    The permittee under any approved site development plan may request modification of such plan by applying to the community development department. Minor adjustments to the original development plan may be made by the director of community development or designee, provided said adjustments are technical corrections which do not have a significant impact on the aesthetics of the project, nor conflict with the intent of the development plans originally adopted by the planning commission. Major adjustments shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission in the same manner and following the same procedure as set forth in MMC 10.05.1720. Although approval of any modification by the city council is not required, the decision of the planning commission granting or denying the modification shall be subject to review by the city council under the same procedures provided for in Article XXVII of this chapter.

B.    In considering any modification, the director of community development or designee, the planning commission, and/or the city council shall consider the following:

1.    Changed conditions which have occurred since the original approval of the site development plan; and

10.05.1735 Subdivision.
Where from the nature of the size, location, shape or topography of the parcel of land, or where from the nature of the improvements or development shown on the development plan or any combination of these factors, it appears to the planning commission or the city council that a future division of ownership or subdivision of said parcel would be required for orderly development by the delineation of subdivided lot lines at the time of initial development, the planning commission or the city council may require the filing of parcel, tentative and/or final subdivision maps, as provided in the subdivision regulations of this chapter and state law, and the performing of any other acts required in such regulations. Where any requirement of the subdivision regulations require any specific act of the landowner or subdivider, the approval of any site development plan shall not become effective until compliance has been made with such subdivision regulation. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 643, § 3; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)08. Formerly 10.05.0560).

10.05.1740 Effect.
No building or zoning permit shall be issued in any case until the approval of a site development plan has become effective, and then only in accordance with the conditions thereof. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 643, § 3; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)09. Formerly 10.05.0570).

10.05.1745 Special fees.
The city council may set a fee schedule to be paid, in addition to any other fee which may be required, to cover the portion of the cost burden of required infrastructure in connection with the issuance of a permit for any building or structure. Lands within the MSAPD district which are retained in large parcels as acreage or otherwise not divided shall be subject to those special fees or charges in accordance with the requirements of resolutions, regulations or ordinances of the city. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 643, § 3; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)10. Formerly 10.05.0580).

10.05.1750 Revocation.
In any case where the terms of approval of a site development plan or the approved development schedule contained therein have not been or are not complied with, the planning commission shall give to the permittee written notice of intention to consider revocation of the approval of a site development plan at least ten days in advance of a planning commission hearing thereon with public notice of such hearing given in the same time and manner as provided in Article XXIX of this chapter. After conclusion of said hearing, the planning commission may recommend that the city council revoke said approval. The city council shall act thereon within thirty days after receipt of said recommendation of the planning commission. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 643, § 3; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)11. Formerly 10.05.0590).

10.05.1755 Improvements and dedications.
A.    In the event that a subdivision map is not required for approval of any site development plan, such approval shall not become effective until conveyances for any required public easements, streets, rights-of-way, or other public areas have been filed with the city clerk and accepted by the city council.

B.    Where any land is to be conveyed for public use, a title report issued by a title insurance company in the name of the owner of the land, issued to or for the benefit and protection of the city, showing all parties whose consent is necessary and the nature of their interests therein, shall be filed with the conveyances of said land.

C.    Where public improvements are to be constructed or where improvements are to be made upon lands to be conveyed to the city, the property owner shall execute and file an agreement between himself and the city providing for the installation of such improvements at the landowner’s cost and expense, and in accordance with the approved development schedule contained in the site development plan. The agreement shall be accompanied by labor, material, and performance bonds. Such improvement agreement and bonds provided for in this chapter shall be considered in a like manner as are requirements upon improvement agreements and bonds under regulations for subdivisions in the city. Such improvement agreement and bonds shall be deemed to include and cover the installation of landscaping and planting as required by any approved plan thereof whether such landscaping and planting shall be upon public or private lands. (Ord. 643, § 3, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)12. Formerly 10.05.0600).

10.05.1760 Control of development schedule.
The director of community development or designee shall compare the actual development accomplished under a site development plan with the approved development schedule and shall report findings to the planning commission if the owners or permittees are failing or have failed to meet the approved schedule. The planning commission may, by adoption of a resolution of intention, initiate proceedings to change conditions of approval or requirements related to the development schedule pursuant to the process for approving the plan as set forth in this article. (Ord. 643, § 3, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(1)13. Formerly 10.05.0610).

10.05.1810 Purpose.
The city council finds that the impact of anticipated development pursuant to the Millbrae Station Area Specific Plan will result in unacceptable decreases in the level of public services and additional burdens on existing city facilities and infrastructure. To prevent these undesirable consequences, the city has determined that certain facilities must be provided at a rate that will accommodate the expected growth in the MSASP area. The city council also desires to ensure that this new development will pay its fair share of the cost of these facilities necessitated by development pursuant to the MSASP. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)03. Formerly 10.05.0640).

10.05.1815 Application.
This article applies to fees charged as a condition of development approval within the MSASP area to defray the cost of the facilities required to serve new development within the city. This article does not replace other city-wide fees, exactions imposed pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act or other measures required to mitigate site-specific impacts of a development project, including, but not limited to, mitigations pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act; regulatory and processing fees; fees required pursuant to a development agreement; funds collected pursuant to a reimbursement agreement that exceed the applicant’s share of public improvement costs; or assessment district proceedings, benefit assessments, or taxes. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)04. Formerly 10.05.0650).

10.05.1820 Establishment of development impact fees and providing for their adoption by resolution of the city council.
A.    Development impact fees are established and imposed on the issuance of all building permits for development within the MSASP area to finance the cost of the following categories of facilities:

1.    Utilities infrastructure;

2.    Traffic improvement measures;

3.    Increased parkland and recreation facilities;

4.    Public safety improvements.

B.    The city council shall from time to time adopt, after a noticed public hearing, the resolution establishing specific development impact fees. In adopting the resolution, the city council shall:

1.    Identify the purpose of the fee;

2.    Identify the use to which the fee is to be put. If the use is financing public facilities, the facilities shall be identified as required by the Mitigation Fee Act;

3.    Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the fee’s use and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed;

4.    Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facility and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed; and

5.    Establish a fee schedule. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 765, § 3; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)05. Formerly 10.05.0660).

10.05.1825 Imposition of development impact fee.
All applicants are required to pay the development impact fee established by MMC 10.05.1820 as the same may be applicable, in the manner, amount, and for the purposes specified, as follows:

A.    Residential Construction. The fee shall be charged for each new dwelling unit. No fee is applicable to a development project for remodeling or for an addition to an existing unit not resulting in a new unit.

B.    Commercial Office, Retail and All Other Construction. The fee shall be charged on a per square foot basis for all new gross floor area, including additions where floor area is increased. No fee is applicable for remodeling or restoration only, where the structure is improved or replaced but the floor area is not increased.

C.    Hotel. The fee shall be charged for each separately rentable hotel room. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)06. Formerly 10.05.0670).

10.05.1830 Timing of development impact fee payment.
A.    The development impact fee established pursuant to this article shall be paid for each approved development project at the time of the issuance of the first required building permit, except as otherwise provided in this article. Any fee imposed on a development that is residential in nature, however, shall be collected in accordance with the provisions of the Mitigation Fee Act, as the same presently exists or may hereafter be amended from time to time. The fee shall apply to all development projects submitted for a building permit after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article.

B.    No city official may issue a building permit for a development until the development impact fee with respect to any such development required by this article has been paid. In no event may a city official issue a certificate of occupancy, or certify a final inspection, as the case may be, for a development which has not paid a required development impact fee. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)07. Formerly 10.05.0680).

10.05.1835 Authority for additional mitigation.
The development impact fee collected pursuant to this article is not intended to replace, satisfy the need for or limit any requirements for the mitigation of impacts which are not specifically identified in the Feasibility Report and Nexus Study, which may result from a development project or which are imposed upon development projects as part of the development review process. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 765, § 4; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)08. Formerly 10.05.0690).

10.05.1840 Exemptions.
A.    The following shall be exempted from payment of the development impact fee:

1.    Alterations, renovations or expansion of an existing residential building or structure where no additional dwelling units are created and the use is not changed; provided, however, that the expansion of an existing commercial or industrial building or structure shall not be exempt from the fee established in this article. For purposes of this section, “expansion” is defined as any increase in the gross floor area of the existing building or structure and “change of use” is defined as the initiation of a use which requires approval of a conditional use permit, development plan or zoning change.

2.    The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed or damaged building or structure with a new building or structure of the same size and use.

3.    City facilities, including, but not limited to, parks, buildings and infrastructure as well as any other public facilities which are entitled under state law to an exemption from development fees.

B.    Any claim of exemption from the imposition of the development impact fee must be made no later than the time for application for fee refunds as set forth in MMC 10.05.1855(A). (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)09. Formerly 10.05.0700).

10.05.1845 Fee credits.
A.    Replacement Construction. Development projects, which would otherwise be subject to the fee under this article, but that will replace structures that were partially or totally destroyed by fire, flood, earthquake, mudslide, or other casualty or act of God, are entitled to a fee credit for that portion of the development project that is replacing construction that was partially or totally destroyed, provided the construction was a lawful use under this title, including a legal nonconforming use, at the time of such destruction. The community development director or designee shall include such a credit in determining the fee in accordance with the fee schedule set forth in the resolution and such credit shall be applicable only to development on the same site.

B.    Applicant Construction of Facilities.

1.    In-Lieu Fee Credits Due.

a.    The community development director or designee may adjust the fee imposed pursuant to this article in consideration of certain facilities constructed or paid for by the applicant. At the discretion of the community development director or designee, an applicant may be entitled to a credit for the value of such facilities to the extent they are identified in the Feasibility Report and Nexus Study and the applicant: (i) constructs the facilities, (ii) finances the facilities by cash or pays the assessments of an assessment district or participates in the formation of a community facilities district, or (iii) a combination of the above.

b.    An amount of in-lieu credit that is greater than the fee required under this article may be reserved and credited toward the fee of any subsequent phases of the same development, if determined appropriate by the community development director or designee. The community development director or designee may set a time limit for reservation of the credit.

2.    No In-Lieu Fee Credits Due for Site-Related Improvements. Credit shall not be given for site-related improvements, including, but not limited to, traffic signals, right-of-way dedications, or providing paved access to the development, which are specifically required by the development project in order to serve it and which do not constitute facilities.

3.    Determination of Credit. The community development director or designee shall determine whether facilities are eligible for credit or reimbursement. The applicant seeking credit and/or reimbursement for construction of the facilities, or dedication of land or rights-of-way, shall submit such documentation, including, without limitation, engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates, and utilize such methods as may be appropriate and acceptable to the community development director or designee to support the request for credit or reimbursement. The community development director or designee shall determine credit for construction of the facilities based upon either these cost estimates or upon alternative engineering criteria and construction cost estimates if the director determines that such estimates submitted by the applicant are either unreliable or inaccurate.

4.    Time for Making Claim for Credit. Any claim for credit must be made no later than the application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.

5.    Transferability of Credit – Council Approval. Credits shall not be transferable from one development project to another without the approval of the city council.

C.    Payment of Park In Lieu Fees. Development fees under this chapter shall be reduced by any payment under Chapter 10.20 MMC.

D.    Appeal of Determinations of Community Development Director. Determinations made by the community development director or designee pursuant to the provisions of this section may be appealed to the city council by filing a written request with the city manager within ten days of the determination of the community development director or designee, together with the applicable fee established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 698, § 1; Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 765, §§ 5, 6; 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)10. Formerly 10.05.0710).

10.05.1850 Appeal.
An applicant for a development project may file a written appeal regarding the imposition and/or calculation of the fee, provided applicant has tendered payment in full of the required fee. Appeals must be filed within ten days of applicant’s tender of payment of the fee to the city. An appeal of the imposition and/or calculation of the fee for a development project not requiring a planning application shall be made to and filed with the community development director or designee. An appeal of the imposition and/or calculation of the fee for a development project requiring a planning application or from the decision of the community development director shall be made to the city council and filed with the city clerk.

The applicant must submit a written request for such a refund to the city manager within thirty days of the expiration of the permit. Failure to timely submit the required request for refund shall constitute a waiver of any right to the refund.

B.    In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of the facilities for which the development impact fee may be expended, revenues from such fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the type to which the fees involved relate.

The report prepared by the city manager and its review by the city council, as well as any findings thereon, shall be subject to the provisions of the Mitigation Fee Act, to the extent applicable.

To this end, the provisions of this article are severable. (Ord. 658, § 2, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.5(2)15. Formerly 10.05.0760).

10.05.2110 Parking lots and spaces.
Any public or private parking lot, or parking area, established to meet the requirements of this chapter for off-street parking spaces shall afford adequate provision for ingress or egress to any parking spaces. Where a lot does not abut on a public or private alley or access easement, there shall be provided an access driveway of not less than ten feet in width to any single-family, duplex or multiple-dwelling composed of less than nine units, and not less than twenty feet in width to all other uses leading to the parking or garage areas required by this chapter. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.817; 1966 Code § 8360. Formerly 10.05.1180).

10.05.2120 Improvement of parking areas.
Every parcel of land hereafter used as an automobile or trailer sales lot, or as a public or private parking lot or parking area, including any commercial parking lot shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following requirements:

A.    Off-street parking lots or parking areas for more than five vehicles shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces premises situated in any “R-1” or “R-2” district or public building, by a masonry wall or solid fence of acceptable design. Such wall or fence shall be not less than three feet or more than six feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition without any advertising thereon. The space between such wall or fence and the side lot line-adjoining premises or the front lot line-facing premises, in any “R-1” or “R-2” district, shall be landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs, or evergreen ground cover and maintained in good condition and, in case the capacity of the parking area exceeds thirty vehicles, it shall be screened by a masonry wall of six feet in height.

B.    Any off-street parking lot, parking area, or parking space, and related driveway, shall be surfaced with asphalt, cement, or comparable material so as to provide a durable and dustless surface, and shall be so graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulated within the parking and related driveway area, and shall be so arranged and marked so as to provide for orderly and safe ingress, egress, maneuvering, loading/unloading, and parking of vehicles.

C.    Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking lot or parking area shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from the adjoining premises in any “R” district.

D.    All public and private parking spaces established to meet the requirements of this chapter for off-street parking spaces shall meet the minimum requirements illustrated in Table 4 below.

10.05.2130 Loading spaces.
A.    In any district, in connection with every building or part thereof hereafter erected and having a gross floor area of ten thousand square feet or more, which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage, warehouse, wholesale store, laundry, dry cleaning plant or other uses similarly requiring the receipt or distribution by vehicles of material or merchandise but not including retail stores and personal service establishments, there shall be provided and maintained on the same lot with such building at least one off-street loading space plus one additional such loading space for each twenty thousand square feet or major fraction thereof of gross floor area so used in excess of twenty thousand square feet. Such loading space shall not be less than twelve feet in width, fifty feet in length, and having a clear height of sixteen feet.

B.    Each loading space may occupy all or any part of any required yard or court space except the front yard, and shall be located no closer than fifty feet to any other lot in any “R” district, unless wholly within a completely enclosed building or surrounded on all sides by a masonry wall not less than eight feet in height. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.819; 1966 Code § 8362. Formerly 10.05.1200).

Prior legislation: 1966 Code § 8503, 1976 Code § 10-1.904 and Ords. 231 and 561.

10.05.2400 General.
Except as otherwise provided in this article, nonconforming lots, uses, or structures existing on the effective date of this chapter may be continued, although the particular nonconformity does not conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which it is located. However, no such nonconformity may be extended to occupy a greater area of land or structure than is occupied on the effective date of this chapter. If any nonconformity is discontinued or abandoned, any subsequent use of such land or structure shall conform to the regulations specified for the district in which it is located. (Ord. 231, Amended by Ord. 643, § 5; Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.901; 1966 Code § 8500. Formerly 10.05.1220).

10.05.2410 Nonconforming lots.
If, prior to the effective date of this chapter, any parcel of land has dimensions or is of a size not in compliance with the regulations of the district in which it is located, such parcel may be developed to the extent possible while conforming to all applicable regulations of the district in which it is located. (Ord. 231, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.902; 1966 Code § 8501. Formerly 10.05.1230).

10.05.2420 Nonconforming uses.
A.    A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restrictive classification upon the securing of a conditional use permit.

B.    If a nonconforming use is replaced by a more restrictive nonconforming use, the occupancy thereafter may not revert to a less restrictive use.

C.    If a nonconforming use is wholly discontinued for a period of ninety days, such use shall be deemed to have been abandoned and all future uses shall comply with the regulations of the particular district in which the land or building is located, except if discontinuation of the use:

1.    Is pursuant to a valid order of a court of law;

2.    Facilitates a required upgrade, retrofit, restoration, remediation, fire suppression, or ADA accommodation. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.2430 Nonconforming structures.
Any structure existing at the date of the adoption of this chapter, or any amendments thereto, which is nonconforming in either location or design shall not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “work”) except in the following situations:

A.    With approval of a conditional use permit when:

1.    The work increases the extent (such as lengthening an encroaching building wall) but does not intensify the degree (such as further encroachment of a building wall) of nonconformity; or

2.    Replacement or restoration of more than fifty percent of the total square footage of any nonconforming building, except single-family dwellings, is performed.

B.    Without approval of a conditional use permit when:

1.    Such work is required by law;

2.    The work will result in eliminating the nonconforming element(s) of the structure;

3.    Normal maintenance, in the form of necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the degree of nonconformity, is performed;

4.    Work on a single-family dwelling that does not extend or intensify the degree of nonconformity may be made as with a conforming structure by securing the required building permit(s), which is a ministerial process. The decision that the work would or would not increase the nonconformity shall be made in the plan-check process. Any work which alters the existing single-story character of the dwelling shall be subject to architectural review as prescribed in this chapter;

5.    Work on a single-family dwelling damaged by fire, explosion, flood, earthquake, or similar catastrophe to restore or replace the dwelling according to the same zoning standards in effect at the time of its construction; provided, that:

a.    All health and safety provisions of the latest edition of the building code are satisfied; and

b.    The total floor area does not exceed that of the former structure; or

6.    Work on all other buildings damaged by fire, explosion, flood, earthquake, or similar catastrophe to restore or replace no more than fifty percent of the total floor area according to the same zoning standards in effect at the time of its construction; provided, that:

a.    All health and safety provisions of the latest edition of the building code are satisfied; and

b.    The total floor area does not exceed that of the former structure. (Ord. 231, Amended by Ord. 245, § 1; Ord. 561, § 3.4; Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.903; 1966 Code § 8502. Formerly 10.05.1240).

10.05.2440 Nonconformance due to rezoning.
The foregoing provisions of this chapter shall apply to lots, uses, and structures which hereafter become nonconforming due to the rezoning of any property under the provisions of this chapter. An existing land use for which a conditional use permit is required by the terms of this chapter shall be considered a nonconforming use, unless and until the required conditional use permit is obtained. (Ord. 231, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.905; 1966 Code § 8504. Formerly 10.05.1260).

10.05.2450 Effect on construction underway.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction, or designated purpose of any structure for which a building permit has been properly issued, in accordance with the regulations then in effect and upon which actual construction has been started prior to the effective date of this chapter, or any amendments thereto; provided, that, in all cases, actual construction shall be diligently carried on to completion of the structure. (Ord. 231, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.906; 1966 Code § 8505. Formerly 10.05.1270).

Article XXV. Design Review, Zoning Permits, Conditional Uses, Exceptions, Variances and Revocations

Prior legislation: 1966 Code §§ 8606 – 8610, 8612, 8621 – 8626, 8628 and 8660 – 8662, 1976 Code §§ 10-1.1003 – 10-1.1008, 10-1.1010 – 10-1.1016 and 10-1.1018 – 10-1.1021 and Ords. 231, 504 and 578.

10.05.2500 Design review permits.
A.    Each application for a permit for the construction, alteration, or exterior modification of a building or for any discretionary entitlement requiring approval under this title shall be subject to design review. Design review for all single-family, duplex, triplex, and multifamily residential development shall be conducted pursuant to the “Residential Design Review Guidelines” adopted by the planning commission and approved by the city council.

B.    Staff Design Review. Each application for a building permit for the construction, alteration, or exterior modification of a building shall be initially reviewed by community development department staff to determine if the proposal is consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

1.    The following types of applications shall be forwarded by staff to the planning commission for final action:

a.    Second floor or higher additions to existing residential development with the exception of second floor or higher additions to single-family detached dwellings in which the proposed addition to the second floor and/or higher floor totals no more than five hundred square feet;

b.    All newly proposed buildings;

c.    Significant exterior alterations to any existing development, as determined by staff; and

d.    Any applications for which a conditional use permit, exception, and/or variance, or any modification thereto or time extension thereof, is/are required or requested.

2.    All other applications shall receive final action by staff.

3.    To facilitate final action by staff, and prior to issuance of any building permit(s), the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation, which may include, but is not limited to, the materials listed in subsection C of this section, as required by staff to determine whether the proposed improvements comply with the policies of the city council. Plans shall be of sufficient clarity to graphically depict the location, nature, and extent of the work proposed and its relationship to the surrounding built environment, and shall conform to the provisions of adopted design guidelines and all applicable city regulations. In the event that the plans as submitted do not fully depict the proposed work, the community development director or designee may require that the plans be redrawn to meet the submittal standards prior to consideration. Buildings which present significant bulk compared to others nearby or which may have a significant impact on neighboring views, privacy, or solar access may be referred, at the discretion of city staff and at the applicant’s expense, to the city’s design consultant for review. Staff shall direct the applicant to change the proposed design as necessary to comply with these standards prior to review by the planning commission or the issuance of any permits.

4.    Final action by staff shall be in the form of approval of a zoning permit.

C.    Planning commission design review shall occur as follows:

1.    Applications shall be considered at a duly noticed public hearing of the planning commission and shall be accompanied by any or all of the following materials together with any other information as may be required by the planning commission:

a.    Site plans showing the relationship of the site to existing or planned streets, paving, sidewalk, and utility lines; proposed ingress and egress patterns; the location of any existing or proposed structures; front, rear, and side setbacks related to the boundaries of the property; the distance from the back of sidewalk to face of garage(s); exterior lighting; walls, fences, or other devices used for screening or separation; proposed grading and any other reshaping of the earth upon the site; and proposed drainage plan;

b.    Architectural drawings or sketches showing plans and elevations of all exterior sides of all proposed structure(s) including height, bulk, types of exterior colors, materials, and textures, and at least one perspective drawing that clearly illustrates what the structure(s) will look like upon completion;

c.    Landscape and irrigation plans showing the proposed location and identification of existing and proposed plants, erosion control and drainage features, and other landscape amenities, a plant list of the botanical name, common name, quantity, and size of all new plant materials, and provisions for landscape maintenance;

d.    Soils and/or geologic reports, signed by a professional licensed to prepare such reports, when requested by the building official; and

e.    Samples of all proposed colors and materials.

2.    Findings. The design review application materials shall be evaluated by the planning commission in relation to the following findings required for approval:

a.    The architectural, landscaping, and general appearance of the proposed building or structure and grounds are in keeping with the character of the neighborhood;

b.    The project complies with all applicable development regulations;

c.    The project complies with the intent of the adopted design review guidelines, including a finding that the project will not cause a significant visual impact to neighboring views from principal rooms of a residence unless it is proven by the applicant that there is no other viable or cost-effective alternative; and

d.    The proposal is not detrimental to the orderly, harmonious and safe development of the city and will not impair the desirability of investment or occupation in the neighborhood in which the building or structure is proposed to be erected.

D.    Approval. For design review applications requiring planning commission action, the planning commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the applications. If approved, the approval shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of approval thereof or within any shorter or longer period of time not to exceed three years, if so designated by the commission. The planning commission shall have authority to extend the period of any prior approval; provided, that a written request for such extension is submitted prior to the date of expiration of the original approval and a hearing has been held, notice of which shall be given in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX.

E.    Appeal Period. Planning commission design review approval shall not be final until ten days have elapsed from the granting thereof, and in case an appeal is filed in the manner provided in Article XXVII of this chapter, shall not be issued until a decision thereon shall have been made by the city council.

F.    Effective Action. No building permit shall be issued until a design review application has been approved by the planning commission or the community development director or designee, as the case may be, and until the applicant has submitted construction plans for the project that are found by city staff to be in substantial compliance with the approved plans/exhibits, as well as with all other applicable city policies, ordinances, and regulations and the California Building Codes.

G.    Adherence to Final Approval. Following approval of a design review permit by the planning commission (or, if appealed, upon approval by the city council) and subsequent to building permit issuance, the applicant shall fully construct or otherwise implement all aspects of said approval as depicted on the approved plans/exhibits. The applicant shall not selectively alter or omit any aspects of said approval since doing so may result in denial of the certificate of occupancy or final inspection.

H.    Fee. The city council may, by resolution, set a fee to be paid at the time an application for design review is made and which shall be in addition to any other fee which may be required to be paid in connection with the issuance of any permit for any structure. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A), Amended by Ord. 750, § 4).

10.05.2510 Zoning permits.
Zoning permits shall be required for all structures hereinafter erected, constructed, altered, repaired, or moved within or into any district established by this chapter, and for the use of vacant land, or for a change in the character of the use of land, within any district established by this chapter. The application for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the city council, and sufficient plans to clearly indicate the proposed use to be made of the land or structure. No building permit shall be issued until the zoning permit portion thereof has been completed by the community development director or designee and any required or requested conditional use permit, exception, or variance has been issued and become effective. (Ord. 231, Amended by Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); 1976 Code § 10-1.1001; 1966 Code § 8600. Formerly 10.05.1280).

10.05.2520 Conditional use permits.
A.    Conditional use permits may be revocable, conditional, and/or valid for a stated time period, and shall be issued only as provided in this article for any of the uses or purposes for which such permits are required by this chapter. The planning commission may impose such conditions as it deems necessary to enforce the intent of this chapter and may require tangible guarantees or evidence that such conditions are being or will be complied with.

B.    Applications for conditional use permits shall be made in writing by the owners of the property, or their agent, on a form prescribed by the community development department. Lessees, purchasers in escrow, optionees, or other persons may act as agents upon filing with the application a copy of an instrument signed by an owner and designating such agent. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the city council, as well as any plans or other exhibits describing the details of the proposed use to be made of the land or structure.

C.    Combined Proceedings. Where the proposed use requires issuance of a conditional use permit under the terms of this chapter and is also subject to design review or exceptions and/or variances are requested in conjunction with the application, all requests may be combined into one application for concurrent processing and review; however, the fees required for each component of such combined application shall be collected in full.

D.    Findings. The conditional use permit application materials shall be evaluated by the planning commission in relation to the following findings required for approval:

1.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use; and

2.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to property and improvements in the neighborhood of such proposed use.

E.    Failure to Act. Failure of the planning commission to act within sixty days of the filing of an application for a conditional use permit shall be deemed a denial of the requested conditional use permit.

F.    Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be held upon each application for a conditional use permit, or for the modification, extension, or revocation of an approved conditional use permit. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX.

G.    Appeal Period. Conditional use permits shall not be issued until ten days have elapsed from the granting thereof, and in case an appeal is filed pursuant to Article XXVII of this chapter, shall not be issued until a decision thereon shall have been made by the city council.

I.    Revocation.

1.    A conditional use permit granted in accordance with the terms of this chapter may be revoked by the city council, in the manner hereinafter set forth, if any conditions or terms of such permits are violated or compliance with the provisions of this chapter is not demonstrated.

2.    Public Hearing. Before the city council considers revocation of any conditional use permit, the planning commission shall hold a duly noticed public hearing thereon after giving written notice thereof to the permittee at least ten days in advance of such hearing and in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX of this chapter. Within five days thereafter, the planning commission shall transmit a report of its findings and its recommendations on the revocation to the city council.

3.    Suspension of Permits. The building official shall not issue any building permit(s) that may still be outstanding at the time that proceedings to consider the revocation of a conditional use permit are initiated. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.1002; 1966 Code § 8605. Formerly 10.05.1290).

10.05.2530 Exceptions.
A.    Exceptions, as specified in this chapter, for permission to deviate from specific development standards shall require planning commission review for approval. In accordance with the intent of this chapter, the planning commission may grant all, none, or part of the deviation(s) sought.

B.    Applications for exceptions shall be made in writing by the owners of the property, or their agent, on a form prescribed by the community development department of the city. Lessees, purchasers in escrow, optionees, or other persons may act as agents upon filing with the application a copy of an instrument signed by an owner and designating such agent. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the city council, as well as plans and/or other exhibits describing the details of the proposed deviation(s) from the minimum required or maximum allowable development standard(s), and evidence justifying the exception.

C.    Combined Proceedings.

1.    When the exception is requested in conjunction with an application for a conditional use permit, design review, and/or variance, all requests may be combined into one application for concurrent processing and review; however, the fees required for each component of the combined application shall be collected in full and the planning commission may take individual final actions on each component.

2.    When more than one exception is requested for a single project, they shall be combined into one application for concurrent processing and review; however, the fees required for each such exception shall be collected in full and the planning commission may take individual final actions on each exception.

D.    Findings. The exception application materials shall be evaluated by the planning commission in relation to the following findings required in order to approve any exception:

1.    The deviation granted from the minimum required or maximum allowable development standard prescribed for the zoning district in which the project site is located will not, under the circumstance of the particular case, be detrimental to property and improvements existing upon any abutting parcel; and

2.    The deviation granted from the minimum required or maximum allowable development standard prescribed for the zoning district in which the project site is located will, under the circumstance of the particular case, be compatible with the property and improvements existing or proposed upon the project site.

E.    Failure to Act. Failure of the planning commission to act within sixty days of the filing of an application for an exception shall be deemed a denial of the requested exception.

F.    Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be held upon each application for an exception. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX of this chapter.

G.    Appeal Period. Exceptions shall not be issued until ten days have elapsed from the granting thereof, and in case an appeal is filed as provided in Article XXVII of this chapter, shall not be issued until a decision thereon shall have been made by the city council.

H.    Acknowledgment. Exceptions shall not have any force and effect until the permittee acknowledges receipt thereof and acceptance of any conditions thereto. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A)).

10.05.2540 Variances.
A.    Variances are required to deviate from the strict application of the terms of this chapter when no other form of regulatory relief is provided in this title. However, a variance may neither be applied for nor granted to allow any land use within a district in which such use is prohibited under the regulations of that district. All variances require planning commission review for approval. In accordance with the intent of this chapter, the planning commission may grant all, none, or part of the deviation(s) sought. Furthermore, a variance is rightfully considered only when all other options for full compliance have been exhausted.

B.    Applications for variances shall be made in writing by the owners of the property, or their agent, on a form prescribed by the community development department of the city. Lessees, purchasers in escrow, optionees, or other persons may act as agents upon filing with the application a copy of an instrument signed by an owner and designating such agent. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the city council, as well as any plans or other exhibits describing the details of the proposed deviation(s) from the minimum required or maximum allowable development standard(s), and evidence justifying the variance.

C.    Combined Proceedings.

1.    When the variance is requested in conjunction with an application for a conditional use permit, design review, or exception, all requests may be combined into one application for concurrent processing and review; however, the fees required for each component of the combined application shall be collected in full and the planning commission may take individual final actions on each component.

2.    When more than one variance is requested for a single project, they shall be combined into one application for concurrent processing and review; however, the fees required for each such variance shall be collected in full and the planning commission may take individual final actions on each variance.

D.    Findings. The variance application materials shall be evaluated by the planning commission in relation to the following findings required in order to approve any variance:

1.    Any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the deviation thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is situated; and

2.    That because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of zoning regulations is found to deprive the subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification.

E.    Failure to Act. Failure of the planning commission to act within sixty days of the filing of an application for a variance shall be deemed a denial of the requested variance.

F.    Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be held upon each application for a variance. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX of this chapter.

G.    Appeal Period. Variances shall not be issued until ten days have elapsed from the granting thereof, and in case an appeal is filed as provided in Article XXVII of this chapter, shall not be issued until a decision thereon shall have been made by the city council.

10.05.2550 Expiration and extension of permits.
Any design review permit, zoning permit, conditional use permit, exception, or variance granted in accordance with the terms of this chapter shall, without further action, become null and void if a building permit application is not submitted within one year from the date of approval thereof or within any shorter or longer period of time not to exceed three years, if so designated by the planning commission or city council, unless extended by action of the planning commission. A public hearing shall be held prior to any such extension and notice of such hearing shall be in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX of this chapter. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 643, § 6; Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.1017; 1966 Code § 8650. Formerly 10.05.1440).

Except as specifically provided herein, this chapter shall not be interpreted to repeal, abrogate, annul, or in any way affect any existing provision of any law or ordinance or regulations or permits previously adopted or issued relating to the erection, construction, moving, alteration, or enlargement of any structure or improvement; provided, however, in any instances where this chapter imposes greater restrictions upon the erection, construction, establishment, moving, alteration, or improvement of structures or the use of any land or structure than are imposed or required by an existing law, ordinance, or regulation, the provisions of this chapter shall control. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.1301; 1966 Code § 8900. Formerly 10.05.1650).

10.05.2610 Administrative interpretations.
If any ambiguity arises concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use within the meaning and intent of this chapter, or with respect to matters of height, setback, area, boundaries, or other development parameter as set forth in this chapter, the director of community development or designee shall consider all pertinent facts, judge the intent of the provision(s) in question, and render a determination in writing, including the basis for the determination, to the inquiring party. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.1302; 1966 Code § 8901. Formerly 10.05.1660).

In the case when the petitioner is not satisfied with the action of the planning commission in deciding any appeal of an administrative interpretation of the provisions of this chapter, or any action of the planning commission in making a determination on any provisions of this chapter, the petitioner may appeal such action to the city council, provided such appeal is submitted within ten days of the planning commission determination.

C.    The city council shall review the appeal at the earliest available city council public hearing, notice thereof to be given in the time and manner provided in Article XXIX of this chapter. Such determination shall be by resolution of the city council and shall be rendered not more than forty-five days after receipt of the resolution of the planning commission.

1.    Whenever the city council is called upon to determine whether or not the use of land or any structure in any zoning district is similar in character to the particular uses allowed in a district, the city council shall consider the following factors as criteria for their determination, in addition to other comparisons:

a.    Effect upon the public health, safety, and general welfare of the neighborhood involved and the city at large;

b.    Effect upon traffic conditions; and

c.    Effect upon the orderly development of the area in question and the city at large in regard to the general planning of the whole community. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.1102; 1966 Code § 8701. Formerly 10.05.1500).

10.05.2710 Appeals of planning commission action.
Any final action of the planning commission taken at any public hearing on any design review permit, conditional use permit, exception, variance, or other matter for which the commission has final approval authority may be appealed to the city council by any person, provided such appeal is submitted within ten days of the planning commission action.

10.05.2730 Public hearing.
Upon receipt of such appeal, the city council shall set the matter for public hearing, notice thereof to be given in the time and manner as provided in Article XXIX of this chapter; provided, that where such appeal concerns itself with interpretation of, or determination under, the provisions of this chapter, the posting of notices shall not be required. (Ord. 726, § 2 (Att. A); Ord. 231; 1976 Code § 10-1.1104; 1966 Code § 8703. Formerly 10.05.1520).

2.    Impose additional conditions or modify conditions previously imposed by the planning commission; or

3.    Deny the permit when such denial is deemed to be in the public interest.

Article VII. Master Sign Program

10.10.330 Master sign program and requirements.
A.    General. The threefold purpose of a master sign program is to identify the (1) maximum permitted sign area allowed on a particular site; (2) on-site areas which are suitable for signs; and (3) permitted on-site signs. A master sign program is subject to review and approval by the planning commission. Once approved, individual businesses may apply for proper permits to erect new signs in compliance with the sign program.

B.    Applicability. A master sign program is initiated by a property owner and is required for all new developments with more than one principal building, all new multiple tenant buildings, all new planned development projects and existing multitenant buildings where significant facade improvements will require the removal of signage. A master sign program is recommended for existing sites with more than one principal building, for existing multitenant buildings and for individual buildings where the site would benefit from a coordinated signage plan.

C.    Required Information. A master sign program shall contain at least the following information:

1.    An accurate site plan;

2.    Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways and landscaped areas;

3.    Computation of the maximum permitted sign area;

4.    An accurate indication on the site plan of the location of each proposed sign, including any signs which are to remain or be removed; and

5.    Scaled drawings of the proposed signs shown on elevations of the building(s) and any freestanding signs showing sign size, copy, graphic style, type of lighting and color scheme.

D.    Procedures. Any sign which conforms to an approved master sign program may be approved by the community development department. Approval of a master sign program does not waive the permit requirements for individual signs.

E.    Amendment. A master sign program may be amended by filing a new master sign program that conforms with all requirements of this section.

F.    Exceptions to Regulations. Exceptions to sign regulations for height, area, location or number may be permitted subject to review and approval of a master sign program. See MMC 10.10.160(A).

G.    Existing Signs Not Conforming to a Master Sign Program. If any new master or amended sign program is filed for property on which existing signs are located, it shall include a schedule for bringing into conformance all signs not conforming to the proposed or amended program, or this chapter.

H.    Binding Effect. After approval of a master sign program, no permanent signs shall be erected, placed, painted or maintained, except in conformance with such plan, and such plan shall be enforced in the same way as any provision in this section. The master sign program shall be attached to the lease agreements for all leasable space within the project. In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan and any other provisions in this chapter, this section shall control. (Ord. 626, § 2; 1976 Code § 10-2.701).

B.    When a major park of the local park or recreational site has already been acquired by the city and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of MMC 10.20.070 shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated pursuant to MMC 10.20.040, such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreational facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the area serving the subdivision.

10.35.010 Purpose.
It is the intent of this chapter to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult-oriented businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult-oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult-oriented businesses in certain areas.

The purposes of this chapter are to implement DIVCA in the city of Millbrae and to regulate, consistent with DIVCA and the implementing rules issued by the California Public Utilities Commission dated March 1, 2007, video service providers holding state video franchises and operating within the city pursuant to that franchise. This chapter shall be applied to and interpreted consistently with any amendments to, or recodifications of, DIVCA that may be made from time to time. (Ord. 736, § 2).

This fee shall be remitted to the city quarterly, within forty-five days after the end of the calendar quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a summary explaining the basis for the calculation of the state franchise fee. If the holder does not pay the franchise fee when due, the holder shall pay a late payment charge at a rate per year equal to the highest prime lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus one percent. If the holder has overpaid the franchise fee, it may deduct the overpayment from its next quarterly payment. (Ord. 736, § 2).

As of March 28, 2017, the city reauthorizes the aforementioned fee on state-franchised video service providers to support PEG channel facilities adopted in Ordinance Number 736 and all other provisions therein. The provisions set forth in Ordinance Number 736, including all fees, shall remain unchanged and in full effect as to all state-franchised video service providers.

B.    Upon the expiration or termination of the current local cable franchise, every state video franchise holder operating within the city shall pay to the city, on a schedule and in a manner to be determined by the city, a PEG capital support fee in an amount equal to one percent of gross revenues per subscriber per month.

C.    Until the expiration or termination of the current local cable franchise, and pursuant to Section 5870(l) of the California Public Utilities Code, every state video franchise holder operating within the boundaries of the city shall be responsible for a pro-rata, per subscriber share of the two outstanding capital grant payments required under the current local cable franchise agreement, totally thirty-one thousand four hundred sixty-three dollars each, scheduled as of September 8, 2010, for payment in January 2011 and January 2016.

A.    The city’s current franchise with Comcast of California IX, Inc., provides for four public, educational and governmental channels for PEG programming. Local franchise holders and holders of a state video franchise under DIVCA shall each provide at least four PEG channels.

B.    All state video franchise holders shall comply with the provisions of DIVCA related to PEG channels. Without limiting the foregoing, the PEG channels shall be carried on the basic service tier. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the basic service tier and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by the incumbent cable operator as defined in Public Utilities Code Section 5830(i) unless prohibited by federal law and shall provide video and sound quality, recording capability, channel accessibility and location equal to, or substantially equal to, that provided by the incumbent cable providers. After the initial designation of PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without agreement of the city unless the change is required by federal law.

C.    A state video franchise holder shall have three months from the date the city requests the PEG channels to designate the capacity. However, the three-month period shall be tolled by any period during which the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible, including any failure or delay of the incumbent cable operator to make adequate interconnection available, as required by DIVCA. Any state video franchise holder which believes that the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible shall provide to city, in writing, its reasons therefor and its plan for correcting or solving the infeasibility. The city may hold a hearing on the claim of infeasibility and, thereafter, take such action as the city deems proper to require the designation and provision of the PEG channels on the state video franchise holder’s system. (Ord. 736, § 2).

Not more than once annually, the city manager or designee may examine and perform an audit of the business records of a holder of a state video franchise operating within the boundaries of the city to ensure compliance with Section 5860 of the California Public Utilities Code. (Ord. 736, § 2).

11.20.060 Customer service penalties.
A.    The holder of a state video franchise shall comply with all applicable state and federal customer service and protection standards pertaining to the provision of video service.

B.

The city manager or designee will provide the state video franchise holder written notice of any material breaches of applicable customer service standards, and will allow the state video franchise holder thirty days from the receipt of the notice to remedy the specified material breach. Material breaches not remedied within the thirty-day time period will be subject to the following penalties to be imposed by the city:

1.    For the first occurrence of a violation, a fine of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars for each violation.

2.    For a second violation of the same nature within twelve months, a fine of up to one thousand dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed three thousand dollars for each violation.

3.    For a third or further violation of the same nature within twelve months, a fine of up to two thousand five hundred dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars for each violation.

C.    A state video franchise holder may appeal a penalty assessed by the city manager to the city council within sixty days of the initial assessment. The city council shall hear all evidence and relevant testimony and may uphold, modify or vacate the penalty. The city council’s decision on the imposition of a penalty shall be final.

As used herein, “material breach” is defined as set forth in Public Utilities Code Section 5900. (Ord. 736, § 2).

The state video franchise holder shall comply with all applicable city construction codes and procedures.

The city maintains the right to perform any public work or public improvement of any description, including, without limitation, all work authorized by applicable law. In the event that the state video franchise holder’s system interferes with the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of any such public work or improvement, the state video franchise holder, after reasonable notice from the city, shall, at its own cost and expense, promptly protect, alter or relocate the system, or any part thereof, as directed by the city.

In the event that the state video franchise holder refuses or neglects to so protect, alter or relocate all or any part of its system, the city shall have the right in connection with the performance of such public work or public improvement to break through, remove, alter or relocate all or any part of the system without any liability to the state video franchise holder except for the city’s willful misconduct and the state video franchise holder shall promptly pay to the city the costs incurred by such breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation. (Ord. 736, § 2).

11.20.080 Police powers.
The rights of a state video franchise holder operating within the boundaries of the city are subject to the police power of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the public, and each state video franchise holder shall comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to such power. (Ord. 736, § 2).

11.20.090 Preemption – Reservation of rights.

(Ord. 736, § 2).
