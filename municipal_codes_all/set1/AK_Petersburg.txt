PREFACE 
    The Petersburg, Alaska Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1980, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 9, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of L.B. Jacobson, city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter and section. Thus, section 2.12.040 is section .040, located in chapter 2.12 of title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 9, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 971, passed December 17, 2012, effective January 1, 2013.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, section 2.04.010 is section .010, in chapter 2.04 of title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note", which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables". This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein". 
    As of Supplement No. 9, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)". If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)". Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)", "(Pending)", "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)". 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 9, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your Code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a water front location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected the site; and 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
5.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 17.14.120(A)(4) and the purpose of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
6.  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
B.  Conditions for Variances. 
1.  Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items a. through k. in Section 14.17.120(A)(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increased the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedure set forth in this section. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 17.14.120(A)(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. 
7.  Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of flood proofing than watertight or dry-flood proofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except 17.14.120(B)(1), and otherwise complies with Sections 17.14.130(A) and (B) of the general standards. 
8.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(Ord. 594 § 3 (part), 1987) 
17.14.130 - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required: 
A.  Anchoring. 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
2.  All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (Reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas" guidebook for additional techniques). 
B.  Construction Materials and Methods. 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
3.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
C.  Utilities. 
1.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
2.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
3.  On-site waste disposal system shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
D.  Subdivision Proposals. 
1.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
2.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
3.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and 
4.  Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less). 
E.  Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source (Section 17.14.120[B]). Applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The rest of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. 
(Ord. 594 § 3 (part), 1987) 
17.14.140 - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 17.14.040 or Section 17.14.110(B), the following provisions are required: 
A.  Residential Construction. 
1.  New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. 
2.  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
B.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
1.  Be flood-proofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
2.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; 
3.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specification and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 17.14.110(C)(2). 
4.  Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not flood-proofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in Section 17.14.140(A)(2). 
5.  Applicants flood-proofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the flood-proofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below that level). 
C.  Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.14.130(A)(2). 
(Ord. 594 § 3 (part), 1987) 
17.14.150 - Encroachments. 
    The cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
(Ord. 594 § 3 (part), 1987) 
17.14.160 - Coastal high hazard areas. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 17.14.040 are coastal high hazard areas, designed as Zones V1-V30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from tidal surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply: 
A.  All new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V1-V30 and VE (V, if base flood elevation data is available) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that: 
1.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level; and 
2.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (one-hundred-year mean recurrence interval. 
    A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsection (A1) and A2) of this section. 
B.  Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in Zones V1-30 and VE, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The local administrator shall maintain a record of all such information. 
C.  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
D.  Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of twenty pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
1.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
2.  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance to being equaled or exceeded in any given year (one-hundred-year mean recurrence interval). 
E.  If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation. 
F.  Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings. Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage. 
(Ord. 594 § 3 (part), 1987)

    It is declared to be the policy of the city to consider the subdivision of land as the first step of community development. 
    Once land has been developed into streets, lots, blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that properly constructed roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important aspects. It is therefore in the interest of the public, the developer and future owners that any subdivision be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper standards.

All other applications under this title shall be governed by the provisions of this title.

A primary monument must consist of a minimum two-inch diameter metal pipe at least thirty inches long with a minimum four-inch flange at the bottom. A minimum two-and-one-half-inch diameter metal cap must be permanently attached at the top. If both the cap and pipe are of nonferrous metal, then additive with magnetic qualities must be permanently attached at both the top and bottom of the monument. Every primary monument cap must be permanently stamped with the year set, the surveyor's registration number, and the corner identification. If it is impractical to set the primary monument as laid out in these standards, one of the following may be substituted: a cap grouted into firm stone or a durable tablet containing a minimum of one thousand cubic inches of concrete and a cap marking the actual corner point. 
b.  Every subdivision must have a minimum of two primary monuments set or recovered on the boundary of the subdivision. All angle points along the subdivision boundary shall have a primary monument. Primary monuments along a subdivision boundary may not be situated more than one thousand three hundred twenty feet apart. If an exterior boundary line is less than two thousand six hundred forty feet, but more than one thousand three hundred twenty feet long, then the intermediate primary monument must be set as close to the midpoint as practical. If the point for a primary monument is in a place that would be impractical to monument because of natural obstacles such as water bodies or roads, a witness corner must be set. The witness distance and course must be shown on the plat of survey from the existing monument as set to the true corner position. Witness corners must always be set on a survey property line at a distance considered reasonable and practical from the true corner point. Witness corners must comply with the standards for primary monuments. 
2.  Secondary Monuments. 
a.  Secondary monuments shall be used for property line curvature control, at interior angle points, and on interior lines that exceed one thousand three hundred twenty feet in length and are not monumented with primary monuments and all other corners that are part of the subdivision. Secondary monuments will consist of at least a five-eighths-inch metal bar four feet long with one and one-half-inch cap attached at the top with the surveyor's registration number and corner identification stamped on the top. 
b.  Secondary monuments do not require monument accessories. All primary monuments must be referenced to at least three bearing trees or objects. If bearing trees or objects are used, they must be located as nearly as possible at right angles and may not be farther than one hundred feet from the monument. A distance to trees or objects must be measured at waist height and in the case of trees measured to the center of the tree with distances reduced to horizontal equivalent. Bearing trees must be marked with a nonferrous metal tag of at least nine square inches in size which must be placed facing the monument. These tags must be clearly and permanently marked as to the corner nomenclature and distance. 
D.  The final plat shall bear the following information: 
1.  A statement referring to private covenants governing the subdivision, if any, as follows: 
 Restrictive covenants were recorded ____________ 20 ____________ , at the ____________ Recording District in Book ____________ , Page ____________ .

18.24.060 - Design principles and standards. 
A.  General Provisions. 
1.  Compliance. The proposed subdivision shall conform to the ordinances of the city. 
2.  Names. All subdivisions shall be named. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate the name of any other subdivision. The platting board has authority to designate the name of the subdivision and shall do so before final plat approval. 
3.  Lands Unsuitable for Development. Lands which have been found to be unsuitable for subdivision because of potential hazards, such as flooding, snow avalanches, rock falls, landslides, unstable slopes, subsidence, high water table, polluted or non-potable water supply, high voltage lines, air or vehicular traffic hazards or other features which may be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of existing or future residents, shall not be subdivided nor included in any building lot unless the hazards are eliminated or will be overcome by approved design and construction plans. The sub-divider must submit engineered plans, acceptable to the municipality, to show said design and construction if development is desired in said areas. 
(Ord. 631 § 3 (part), 1989) 
18.24.070 - Major Subdivision-Streets. 
A.  Generally. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the zoning ordinance of the city and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, public convenience and safety, in their appropriate relation to adjoining subdivisions, and their compatibility with the city. The arrangement and other design standards of streets will conform to all provisions of this title. 
B.  Improvements. Roads shall be graded and essential utilities improved to conform to applicable standards and specifications adopted by the city and shall be approved as to design and specifications by the city engineer and/or superintendent of public works in accordance with the approved construction plans. 
C.  Street arrangement. 
1.  The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas. 
2.  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topographic or other physical conditions. 
3.  A gridiron street pattern need not necessarily be adhered to and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de- sacs, and loop streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout. The street shall be laid out in such a way as to make the best use of the topography of the land consistent with the type of development. 
4.  Where a half-street is adjacent to the subdivision, the other half of the street must be dedicated by the adjacent sub-divider. 
5.  Collector streets shall be properly related to the public street system, to special traffic generating facilities such as schools, churches, and shopping centers, to population densities and to major streets into which they feed. 
6.  Minor streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and sewer systems, and to require the minimum amount of street necessary to provide convenient safe property access. 
D.  Access to Primary Roads. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a limited access highway right-of-way or easement or an existing or proposed major street, the platting board may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means: 
1.  Subdivision of lots so that back yards border on the primary arterial street and front on a parallel local street; with no access provided from the primary arterial, and screening and/or a corridor of land provided along the rear property line of such lots; 
2.  A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the major arterial, and separated with screening and/or a corridor of land provided along the rear property line of such lots; 
3.  A marginal access or service road separated from arterial by a corridor of land and having access thereto at suitable points. 
E.  Street Names. Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing street names unless a new street is a continuation of or in alignment with the existing street. On major subdivisions, street names shall be approved by the platting board. House numbers shall be assigned by the planning department in accordance with the house numbering system in effect in the city. 
F.  Street Design Standards. 
1.  Cul-de-sacs. Streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall not be longer than four hundred feet in length, and shall be provided at the closed end with an additional circular turnaround having a radius not less than fifty feet. Offset or T-shaped turnarounds providing equivalent radius may be substituted. 
2.  Grade. The grade of any street shall not exceed ten percent without the approval of the engineering and public works departments. 
3.  Grade Changes. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves. 
4.  Intersections. 
a.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. The intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than seventy degrees shall not be permitted without the approval of the engineering and public works departments. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least one hundred feet there from. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point without prior approval of the platting board. 
b.  Adequate stopping sight distance to traffic control devices will be provided at each intersection. Sight distance must be equal to or exceed the stopping sight distance required for the speed limit of the intersecting street. In no case will sight distance be less than one hundred fifty feet. 
c.  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. 
d.  Intersections shall be designed with a minimum grade. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided to conform to applicable standards and specifications adopted by the city, and to ensure adequate traffic safety. 
e.  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way or easement to a distance of twenty-five feet from the intersection or to the extent deemed necessary to provide sight distance. An easement shall be provided on the plat for required cut slopes. 
f.  The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be three percent or less. 
5.  Alleys. Alleys may be required to the rear of lots used for business purposes.

(Ord. 631 § 3 (part), 1989) 
18.24.080 - Easements. 
A.  Generally. Rights-of-way or easements at least five feet along the front property lines of lots, together with the right of ingress and egress, shall be provided where necessary for public utilities. An anchor pole easement ten feet wide, twenty-five feet deep, appropriately placed, together with the right of ingress and egress shall be provided where necessary for public utilities. Buried utilities are recommended wherever possible. 
B.  Temporary Easements. An additional five-foot temporary easement, on each side of the existing easement, shall be granted for initial installation of utility systems when necessary. Said temporary easement shall be for a term not to exceed ninety consecutive days from the date of beginning of construction unless otherwise required by the platting board. 
C.  Drainage Easements. 
1.  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, a storm water or drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the exterior boundaries of such watercourse shall be provided. Such easement or right-of-way may be of such additional width or construction, or both, as will be adequate as determined by the city engineer. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow. 
2.  There shall be at least a ten-foot wide easement on either side of any creek or stream. The platting board may require wider easements if the stream is anadromous as determined by the platting board after consultation with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. 
3.  Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road right- of-way lines and with satisfactory access to the road. All easements shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from any road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 
4.  When a proposed drainage system is designed to carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage easements or other rights must be secured by the sub-divider and indicated on the application.

Chapter 18.28 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 
Sections: 

18.28.010 - General provisions. 
    In addition to standard subdivision layouts, it is the intent of the city to permit a reasonable degree of latitude in subdivision and improvement standards to encourage imaginative and innovative design. This is allowable for subdivision developments proposed as planned unit cluster development projects, commercial centers, industrial parks, and shopping centers. Any such plans submitted shall include design and construction elements, common use facilities, open space, private housing and land management maintenance, etc., subject to requirements of all existing city ordinances, except as may be modified by this chapter, in order to arrive at alternative urban and rural land development quality, different from conventional design. 
    The general purposes of the planned unit development are as follows: 
A.  Create an alternative method for property development where the strict application of subdivision standards does not address the process of combined residential and commercial development and alternative land development techniques; 
B.  Provide for more efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks of utilities, safer networks of streets, lower construction and maintenance costs to the general public, creates greater opportunities for public and private recreation and provide open space; 
C.  Encourage harmonious and coordinated development of the site. Primary considerations should be the relationship of natural features, community facilities and pedestrian and vehicular circulation to overall transportation plans and the land use relationship with surrounding properties and the general community; 
D.  Encourage the enhancement and conservation of lands which have scenic, environmental, cultural, or historic significance. 
(Ord. 631 § 3 (part), 1989) 
18.28.020 - Cluster development projects. 
A.  Planned unit developments may include cluster development projects in which the individual lots are substantially smaller than otherwise allowed, provided there is at least as much open space as specified under Title 19 of this code (maximum lot coverage and density), within the total development as would exist if all lots were of standard size. 
1.  The density and maximum lot coverage for the project area as a whole shall be the same as allowed under Title 19 of this code, unless a variance is approved by the commission. 
2.  All of such open space shall be dedicated to scenic or recreational purposes and to be enjoyed in common by all residents of the development, their guests and where applicable, by the general public. 
B.  The purpose of such a cluster development is to allow residences in a portion or portions of the development site to be built at greater density than allowed in Title 19 of this code, but with substantially larger total open space to provide better use of land contours and to utilize what otherwise might be waste land as common areas to be enjoyed by all. All such cluster developments shall include provisions as follows: 
1.  Appropriate provisions for continued use and maintenance of open areas. These provisions shall include a contract commitment between owners to maintain common areas, a provision for its administration and specification of uses. Equivalent provisions for the above may be accepted by the platting board. 
2.  The common areas shall be utilized in a feasible manner beneficial to the residents primarily, but consideration shall be given to the public's use. 
3.  If there are to be individual owners of the cluster development units, then appropriate and adequate provisions must be made concerning the future sale of such units to provide for the maintenance and upkeep of the open space as stated in subsection 1 of this section above as well as the free alienation of said units. 
(Ord. 631 § 3 (part), 1989) 
18.28.030 - Condominium developments. 
    A planned unit development utilizing a condominium development shall follow the same procedures as cluster developments with zero setbacks allowed, provided it is consistent with the concept plan (reference Section 18.28.070). The concept plan shall include specific provisions concerning the division of ownership of the individual dwelling units, as well as provisions for maintenance, utility costs, ownership of common areas, appearance and cleanliness, violations of agreement provisions, along with such other provisions as may be required by the platting board consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 631 § 3 (part), 1989) 
18.28.040 - Ownership.

A.  Do so in accordance with the concept plan of development officially adopted for the planned unit development, the regulations existing when the planned unit development is passed by the platting board and such other conditions or modifications as may be attached to the land at the time the planned unit development is approved; 
B.  Provide contracts, and proposed deed restrictions acceptable to the municipality as to content, for the completion of the undertaking in accordance with the adopted concept plan as well as for the continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions and facilities as are not to be provided, operated or maintained at general public expense; 
C.  Bind any developer successors in title to any commitments made under subsections A and B of this section.

All comments received by the applicant shall be available ten days prior to the public hearing concerning the concept plan or preliminary plat. 
B.  After the hearing on the preliminary plat and concept plan, the platting board will review and give approval as submitted, conditional approval or deny the concept plan application. If given conditional approval, the applicant has thirty days to submit additional data required by the platting board. If requested, an extension may be granted by the platting board. If the platting board elects to deny the concept plan application, it must state the specific reasons for such denial as further provided in Section 18.12.040, and state what corrective measures may be taken by the applicant, if any, to correct the stated objections.

(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.64.120 - Exceptions-Public parking lot substitutions. 
A.  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, when a use is located within five hundred feet of an existing or planned public lot, the off-street parking requirements of this chapter may be met if, under the procedures specified in Chapter 19.72 of this title, the commission issues a conditional use permit stating that the following conditions have been met: 
1.  The public parking lot exists within five hundred feet of the use, or plans for the public parking lot are sufficiently advanced to give reasonable assurance that the lot will be in use within one year of the time of issuance of the conditional use permit. 
2.  The public parking lot has or will have sufficient capacity to accommodate the use in question plus other parking needs of existing and potential uses within a five hundred foot radius of the lot. The commission shall use the off-street parking requirement cited above to estimate the parking spaces needed within five hundred feet of the lot. 
B.  To finance public parking within the PD-1, PD-2, or remaining balance of the downtown C-1 Zone, and to assure that all parties required to provide off-street parking shall assume the costs, in lieu of providing off-street parking as required in Section 19.64.020, with the approval of the planning commission, the owner and/or occupant of the use in question may elect to: 
1.  Sign a covenant agreeing to join an assessment district to pay for a public parking facility; or 
2.  Pay into a trust fund established by the city for future downtown parking expansion, a sum equivalent to two hundred square feet per required parking space at the current assessed value of the property being developed. In addition, the amount paid to the city will be refunded to the owner or occupant after a period of fifteen years if not utilized in the construction of a public parking facility.

B.  There are three types of nonconforming status: 
1.  Nonconforming Lots. The lot width or acreage is smaller than the minimum permitted in the zone in which it is located. 
2.  Nonconforming Structure. The structure is designed to accommodate a nonconforming use or fails to meet yard, coverage, height or other development requirements established for the zone in which it is located. 
3.  Nonconforming Uses of Land and/or Structures. The use to which land and/or structures is being put is not a principal, accessory or conditional use permitted in the zone in which it is located, and is not otherwise permitted in this title. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.020 - Intent. 
A.  Within the zones established by this title or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this title or under any future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their perpetuation. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
B.  Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zones involved. A nonconforming use of land or structure, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the zone involved. 
C.  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure, building or land on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the original effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title and upon which actual construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is defined to include the lawful acquisition of a building permit and the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently. Actual construction also means the lawful acquisition of a building permit and evidence of substantial change of position, expenditures or incurrence of obligations, financial or otherwise, made lawfully and in good faith under the permit. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.030 - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    Single-family dwellings and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any lot which is of record at the effective date of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for the area or width, or both, that are applicable in the zone. Furthermore, setback requirements and other yard requirements applicable to those nonconforming lots of record shall be those of the zone in which the nonconforming lot is located. Variance of any other requirements must be sought by application to the commission. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.040 - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or amendment of this title that could not be built under the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; 
B.  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this title; 
C.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in which it is located after it is moved. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.050 - Nonconforming uses of structures. 
    If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title, said use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  No existing structures devoted to a use not permitted by this title in the zone in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except if changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone in which it is located. 
B.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
C.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the commission shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate, or more appropriate, to the zone than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this title. 
D.  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
E.  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for twenty-four consecutive months, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the zone in which it is located. 
F.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.060 - Nonconforming uses of land. 
    Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this title as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. 
B.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. 
C.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of twelve consecutive months, any subsequent use of such land must conform to the regulations specified by this title and the zoning map for the district in which the land is located; and similarly, if any such nonconforming use of land is voluntarily abandoned, the same requirements shall apply immediately upon abandonment and, in this context, six months' of discontinuance of the nonconforming use shall create a rebuttable presumption that the nonconforming use has been abandoned and twelve months of discontinuance shall create a conclusive presumption of abandonment. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.070 - Conditional uses deemed conforming uses. 
    On any nonconforming structure or on any buildings devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement value of the building; provided, that the cubical content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title shall not be increased. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.080 - Permits for nonconforming uses. 
    The continuation of nonconforming uses of land or structures, or land and structure shall be allowed only by the acquisition of a permit from the commission.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, no junked vehicle or junk shall be stored outside and no junk or wrecking yard shall be maintained in a location which is visible from a major road as defined in Section 19.04.490 of this title unless it is screened from view by a sight obscuring fence of good appearance or hedge of good appearance. For the purposes of this section, "junk" means worn out and discarded material in general that may be turned to some use; especially old rope, chain, iron, copper, parts of machinery and bottles gathered or bought up by tradesmen called junk dealers, but not limited to commercial venture, and shall further include parts of buildings, fixtures and appliances; hence, rubbish of any kind; odds and ends. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.68.100 - Board of adjustment may authorize nonconforming public buildings. 
    The board of adjustment may, after public hearing within ten days' notice by special permit and subject to such protective restrictions as it may deem necessary; authorize the location in any district within the city of any public building erected for and used by any department of the city, state or federal government, or any building or other structure erected and used by any public utility operated under a franchise granted by the city.

Chapter 19.72 - CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS 
Sections: 

19.72.010 - Purposes of provisions-Regulations generally. 
A.  There are some uses which, because of their potential impact on neighboring properties or, because of their public service nature, should receive commission review in each case. In this manner, detailed consideration can be given to factors affecting the suitability of the proposed location. The conditional uses are specified within Chapters 19.12 through 19.68 of this title. 
B.  The commission shall permit these uses if, in addition to meeting the off-street parking regulations, development requirements and all other requirements of this title, the conditions set forth in this chapter are met. 
(Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.72.020 - Conditions of approval. 
A.  The commission shall consider the suitability of the property, the character of the surrounding property and the economic and aesthetic effects of the proposed use upon the property and neighboring property. The use will be permitted if it is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title and where the use will be in keeping with the uses generally authorized for the zone in which the use is to take place. The commission shall require the conditional user to take those steps necessary so that the permitted conditional use will not be offensive because of injurious and noxious noise, vibrations, smoke, gas, fumes or odors or will not be hazardous to the community because of danger of fire or explosion. 
B.  Exits and entrances and off-street parking for the conditional use shall be located to prevent traffic hazards or congestion on public streets.

Sections: 

19.76.010 - Purpose of provisions. 
    There are some instances when the private sector needs to use city property for uses other than what the property was initially intended for. A special use permit provides for consideration of factors affecting the suitability of the proposed activity.

The failure of any person to receive any notice required under this section, where the records of the city indicate the notice was provided in a timely and proper manner, shall not affect the validity of any proceeding under this section. 
(Ord. 600 § 3 (part), 1987: Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985) 
19.80.050 - Conditions of approval. 
    The planning commission must find all three of the following conditions to exist in order to grant the variance: 
A.  That there are exceptional physical circumstances or conditions applicable to the property or to its intended use or development which do not apply generally to the other properties in the same zone; 
B.  That the strict application of the provisions of this title would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary pecuniary hardships; 
C.  That the granting of the variance will not result in material damage or prejudice to other properties in the vicinity nor be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(Ord. 600 § 3 (part), 1987: Ord. 557 § 3 (part), 1985)

19.80.080 - Expiration of approval. 
    Any variance approved by the planning commission shall expire unless the privilege granted is utilized within one year after the granting of the variance. Any permittee having an un-expired approval may apply for an extension of the time within which he may commence work under that approval when he is unable to commence work within the time required by this section.
