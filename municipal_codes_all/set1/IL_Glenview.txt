PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Glenview, Illinois. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1959 Code, and ordinances adopted by the president and board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1959 Code, and any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many State and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

In the case of repealed chapters, sections or subsections, or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages affected thereby.

(a)  By contract or administrative direction, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed. A supplement to this Code shall include all substantive parts of general ordinances passed by the Village Board during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be numbered so that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may, without Village Board authorization, make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance," or words of the same meaning, to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections or the alphabetical arrangement of new chapters inserted into the Code. In no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.  
Sec. 1-16. - General penalty. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the Village any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any ordinance shall be considered a petty offense subject to a fine of not less than $100.00 and not exceeding $1000.00. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  Any fine, judgment, penalty, or cost that remains unpaid after 60 days from the day upon which it is assessed shall operate as a lien upon the underlying parcel that is superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens. 
(c)  The Village clerk is authorized to collect or receive any and all fines assessed or imposed by any hearing officer or court of competent jurisdiction by virtue of a violation of any provision of this Code or any other ordinance violation of the Village, except as maybe otherwise provided by law.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 2-1. - Code of ethicsDeclaration of policy and purpose. 
(a)  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsive to the people they serve; government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; public office not be used for personal gain or to advance the interests of family or relatives; and the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of such goals, there is established a code of ethics for all Village public officials, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, and for Village employees. The purposes of sections 2-1 through 2-25 are to establish ethical standards of conduct for all such public officials and employees by setting forth the acts or actions which are inconsistent with the best interests of the Village and its inhabitants and by requiring 1) a duty of confidentiality to the extent permitted and required by law and 2) the disclosure by public officials and employees of private financial or other pecuniary personal interests in matters which may affect the Village. 
(b)  Sections 2-1 through 2-25 are founded upon the principle that no individual shall receive any impermissible financial or other gain by reason of their serving as a public official or employee of the Village, and that no private person or taxpayer, including public officials or employees, or their family members, should receive any benefits from Village action beyond that which is available to any other private person or taxpayer due to their relation to or as a result of privileged information or support provided by any public official or employee. 
(Code 1959, § 2.82; Ord. No. 5636, § 6, 2-19-2013)  
Sec. 2-2. - SameDefinitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in sections 2-1 through 2-25, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Business entity means any business, proprietorship, firm, partnership, person in a representative or fiduciary capacity, association, venture, trust or corporation. 
Campaign for elective office means any activity in furtherance of an effort to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any federal, state, or local public office or office in a political organization, or the selection, nomination, or election of Presidential or Vice-Presidential electors, but does not include activities:

(Ord. No. 5636, § 3, 2-19-2013)  
Sec. 2-442. - Applicability.

(3)  Commission members must be residents of the Village unless otherwise provided herein. 
(4)  Vacancies. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as other appointments. 
(5)  Alternates. If the commission is authorized to have alternate members, the alternates shall be given numerical appointments (first alternate, second alternate etc.). When a member or members of the commission are absent, the alternates shall act as full members of the commission in their numerical order, that is, the first alternate shall first act as a full member; the second alternate shall be then next to so act, etc. 
(6)  Compensation. All members are to serve without compensation except as otherwise provided by local ordinance or state statute; authorized expenses may be reimbursed in accordance with applicable Village regulations. 
(7)  Removal of members. Any member of any commission may be removed from office by a majority vote of the Board of Trustees at any regular or special meeting, provided however that a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals may only be removed for cause by the Board of Trustees after first conducting a public hearing in accordance with chapter 98, subsection 98-43(b)(1).

(1)  Vicious dog means any individual dog: 
a.  That, when unprovoked, inflicts bites or attacks a human being either on public or private property. 
b.  With a known propensity, tendency or disposition to attack without provocation, to cause injury or to otherwise endanger the safety of a human being.

If a dog is found to be a vicious dog, the dog shall be subject to enclosure, as defined in subsection (3) of this section, or destruction as may be directed in the sole discretion of the animal control officer in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c)(1) of this section, or destruction as may be ordered by a judge of the circuit court of the County. 
(2)  Dangerous dog means any individual dog which, when either unmuzzled, unleashed or unattended by its owner, handler or keeper, in a vicious or terrorizing manner, approaches any person or domestic animal in an apparent attitude of attack upon any street, sidewalk or public grounds or places, or private property of a person other than the owner, handler or keeper of the dog. 
(3)  Enclosure means a fence or structure of a least six feet in height, forming or causing an enclosure suitable to prevent the entry of young children, and suitable to confine a vicious dog in conjunction with other measures which may be taken by the owner, handler or keeper, such as tethering of a vicious dog within the enclosure. Such enclosure shall be securely fenced and locked, and designed with secure sides, top and bottom, and shall be designed to prevent the dog from escaping from the enclosure. 
(4)  Found to be a vicious dog means that: 
a.  The animal control officer or a law enforcement officer has conducted an investigation and made a finding in writing that the dog is a vicious dog, as defined in subsection (a)(1) of this section, and based on that finding, the animal control officer has declared in writing that the dog is a vicious dog; or 
b.  A judge of the circuit court of the County has found the dog to be a vicious dog, as defined in subsection (a)(1) of this section, and has entered an order based on that finding. 
(5)  Impounded means taken into the custody of the animal control officer or other law enforcement officer. 
(b)  Any dog found to be a vicious dog, which has not been impounded and destroyed, shall be confined to an enclosure. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog unless such dog is at all times kept in an enclosure.

(1)  If the owner, handler or keeper of the dog, after being given written notice of the impoundment order, has not appealed the impoundment order to the circuit court of the County within seven days from the date of impoundment, the dog may be humanely destroyed by lethal injection administered by a licensed veterinarian. 
(2)  A dog found to be a vicious dog that is not destroyed shall not be released to the owner until the animal control officer approves an enclosure, as defined in subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
(3)  No owner, keeper or handler of a vicious dog shall sell or give away such dog. 
(d)  It is unlawful for any person to maintain a public nuisance by permitting any vicious dog or dangerous dog to leave the premises of its owner, keeper or handler when not under control by a leash or other recognized control methods as may be otherwise provided under this section. 
(e)  Sentry, guard or police owned dogs that attack or injure a person, while performing duties as trained, are exempt from this section; provided, however, that the owner, handler or keeper of such exempt dog has previously provided the animal control officer with the address of the premises in which such exempt dog is housed and/or maintained. To qualify for exemption under this section, each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in accordance with section 8 of the Illinois Animal Control Act. It shall be the duty of the owner, keeper or handler of such exempt dog to notify the animal control officer of changes of address. In the case of a sentry or guard dog, the owner shall keep the animal control officer advised of the location where such dog will be stationed. The animal control officer shall provide the police and fire departments with a categorized list of such exempt dogs, and shall promptly notify such departments of any address changes reported to him, as the case may be.

Note: These heat losses are based on an assumed wind velocity at the water surface of 3½ miles per hour (mph). For a velocity of five mph, multiply these losses by 1.25, and for ten mph, multiply by 2.0. 
The average wind velocity in miles per hourFor spas under 900 square feet, in built-up areas where the spa is sheltered by nearby fences, buildings or shrubs from the prevailing winds, an average velocity of 3½ mph may be assumed. For more exposed locations or higher wind velocities, see above footnote of the heat loss table. For indoor spas where the indoor temperature is a little lower, if any, than the water temperature, a heat loss factor of 100 Btus per hour, per square foot of spa surface may be used. Experience has indicated that when a spa cover is used, heat loss will be reduced by 50 percent or more. If it is desired to raise the temperature in a given time period, the following formula may be used: 
Heater output (Btu/hour) = Spa volumes (gallons) × temperature difference (degrees Fahrenheit) × 8.3 + ½ surface loss.

ARTICLE XIII. - SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 
 
Sec. 18-771. - Findings of fact; purpose. 
(a)  The president and board of trustees find that: 
(1)  Excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas that are undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses, including, but not limited to, the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, and the creation of recreational facilities; 
(2)  The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles; 
(3)  Such soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed-out fills and embankments; 
(4)  The sediment from such soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches, and pollutes and silts rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs; 
(5)  Such sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes, destroying fish and other aquatic life, and that is costly and difficult to remove; and 
(6)  Such sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways, resulting in greatly increased chances of flooding at grave danger to public health and safety. 
(b)  It is the purpose of this article to provide minimum standards to safeguard persons, protect property and prevent the despoliation of the environment, and promote the public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials and use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth.

(d)  Review. To further the specific purposes of this article, the following review procedures are established: 
(1)  Grading work under 500 cubic yards. Where the aggregate volume of grading on any site or contiguous group of sites is in excess of 100 cubic yards, but not over 500 cubic yards, the director of development or his/her designee shall review the application for the proposed site development permit. If the director of development or his/her designee finds the application for the proposed grading plan in conformance with the provisions of this article, he may issue a permit, with such reasonable conditions as he may deem necessary to substantially secure the objectives of this article, or he may, in the alternative, refer the application to the North Cook County Soil and Water Conservation District in the manner provided in subsection (d)(2) of this section. 
(2)  Grading work in excess of 500 cubic yards and/or removal of vegetation. 
a.  Where the aggregate volume of grading on any site or contiguous group of sites is in excess of 500 cubic yards or the proposed cuts and fills exceed five feet at their maximum point, or where approval to remove plant cover is required by this article, the director of development or his/her designee shall refer the application to the North Cook County Soil and Water Conservation District for review and recommendation. Such recommendations shall be submitted to the director of development or his/her designee within 30 days. 
b.  Upon receipt of the recommendations of the North Cook County Soil and Water Conservation District, and after consideration thereof, the director of development or his/her designee shall approve the application with such reasonable conditions as he may deem necessary to substantially secure the objectives of this article, or disapprove the application for the site development. 
c.  Failure of the director of development or his/her designee to make a determination upon the approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the application for a site development permit within 60 days after receipt of all necessary information for such action will constitute an approval of the application unless such time is extended with the consent of the applicant. 
(3)  Earth removal. No site development permit shall be issued for an intended building site unless: 
a.  Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building permit issued by the Village; or 
b.  The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall plan previously approved by the Village for the area in which the site is situated. 
(e)  Appeals. The applicant, as well as any person who has received notice of the filing of the application for a site development permit, or the North Cook County Soil and Water Conservation District may appeal the decision of the director of development or his/her designee, including any approval resulting from lack of action by the director of development or his/her designee as provided in subsection (d)(2)c. of this section, to the zoning board of appeals. Upon receipt of an appeal, the zoning board of appeals shall schedule and hold a public hearing, after giving 15 days' notice thereof. The zoning board of appeals shall render a decision within 30 days of the hearing. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but not be limited to, possible saturation of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainageways; nature and type of soil or rock that, when disturbed by the proposed grading, may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape through grading or removal of vegetation. 
(f)  Responsibility. Failure of Village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions or to recommend denial of the site development permit, or of the zoning board of appeals to deny such permit shall not relieve the permittee from responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom and shall not result in the Village, its officers or agent being responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom. 
(g)  Retention of plans, specifications and reports. Plans, specifications and reports for all site developments shall be retained in original form or on microfilm by the director of development or his/her designee. 
(h)  Inspections. The director of development or his/her designee shall make inspections as required in this article and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the site development plan. Where it is found by inspection that conditions are not substantially as stated or shown in the plan, the director of development or his/her designee may stop further work until approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to the existing conditions. Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of approval of the director of development or his/her designee, shall be maintained at the site during progress of the grading. Until the final inspection is made, a sign issued by the Village indicating permission to grade has been granted by the Village shall be prominently displayed on the front property line of the property involved so as to be visible from the street on which the property fronts. In order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following schedule, the permittee shall notify the director of development or his/her designee at least two full working days before the inspection is to be made: 
(1)  Rough grading. The rough grading inspection shall be performed when all rough grading has been completed. 
(2)  Final inspection. The final inspection shall be performed when all work indicated on the site development plan has been completed.

(c)  Special precautions. 
(1)  If, at any stage of the grading, the director of development or his/her designee determines by inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the director of development or his/her designee may require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. Special precautions may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control and reports of a professional engineer specializing in soils and/or engineering geology, who certifies as to his specialty, whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work. 
(2)  Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the director of development or his/her designee may specify the time of starting grading and the time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. 
(d)  Permit expiration. Every site development permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within 180 days, or is not completed within one year from the date of issue of such permit, except that the director of development or his/her designee may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time, if written application is made before the expiration date of the permit.

(Ord. No. 5215, § 2(18-902), 5-19-2009)  
Sec. 18-1029. - "Vacant building" determination. 
(a)  Within 60 days after the effective date of this article, the director shall evaluate all buildings in the Village believed to be unoccupied on the effective date of this article and make a determination for each as to whether the building is a "vacant building" within the meaning of section 18-1028. The director may determine that a building which meets any of the criteria set forth in section 18-1028 is not to be regulated under this article for a stated period, if upon consideration of reliable, substantiated and sufficient evidence, the director determines that regulation of the building under this article would not serve the public health, welfare, and safety and makes written findings in support of this decision. The determination shall be in writing and shall state the factual basis for the determination. 
(b)  For buildings the director determines to be "vacant buildings", the director shall, within seven days of making that determination, send notice of this written determination with the factual findings to the last taxpayer of record listed on the most recent Cook County tax roll. Said notice of determination shall be sent first-class United States mail, with proper postage prepaid. Failure of delivery shall not excuse a person from complying with this article. The director may personally serve or cause personal service of the notice of determination. Any person making such service shall execute an affidavit attesting to the facts of service. The director shall maintain an affidavit of such mailing for each notice of determination sent. 
(c)  The notice shall specify a date and time on which the owner may voluntarily allow for a code compliance inspection of the interior of the vacant building and surrounding yards and property to determine the extent of compliance with Village property, building, health, fire, and plumbing codes. 
(1)  For residential buildings, if a voluntary code compliance inspection is scheduled by the owner and a plan to maintain the structure, yards and property is submitted by the owner to, and approved by, the Village no costs for the code compliance inspection will be assessed by the Village. 
(2)  For all commercial buildings and residential buildings, if a voluntary code compliance inspection is not scheduled by the owner all Village costs and fees associated to all actions to gain entry to the structure, yards and property will be the responsibility of the owner. Unpaid costs and fees shall be recaptured by a lien upon the premises. 
(d)  The notice shall contain a statement of the obligations of the owner of a building determined to be vacant, a copy of the registration form the owner is required to file pursuant to section 18-1031, and a notice of the owner's right to appeal the director's determination.

Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the Village manager within 15 days of the date of mailing of the notice of determination. The filing of an appeal stays the owner's obligation to register his building as required by section 18-1031.

The Village manager shall decide the appeal on the basis of facts presented by the owner in his or her written appeal and the director's written determination. 
(b)  The burden is upon the owner to present sufficient evidence to persuade the Village manager that had the evidence been known to the director at the time the director made the determination, the director would more likely than not have determined that the subject building was not a "vacant building" within the meaning of this article. 
(c)  The Village manager shall send written notice of a decision to the owner within ten days of his or her receipt of the appeal. The Village manager may, but is not required to, seek additional information from the owner. The Village manager may, upon written notice thereof to the owner, take no more than ten additional days, to decide the appeal if he or she determines that such additional time is required for consideration of the appeal. 
(d)  An owner who wishes to challenge applicability of this article to his/her building without the director's determination having been made, shall set forth specific facts to support non-applicability in a writing to the director. In the event the director determines that the subject building is a "vacant building", the owner shall have the right to appeal the director's determination to the Village manager as provided for herein.

(2)  The form shall require the owner to indicate his or her "Acceptance of Notice by Posting" consenting to service of notices sent or required to be sent, pursuant to this article, by posting on the building if the owner fails to renew the registration, if required, or maintain as current with the director the information required regarding the person designated to accept notice and service of process; 
The owner shall allow for a code compliance inspection of the interior of the vacant building and shall be subject to Village costs and fees outlined in section 18-1029(c) within 30 days of the inspection. Such inspection will determine the extent of compliance with all applicable Village property, building, electrical, plumbing, fire and similar codes.

The owner shall maintain the building in an enclosed and secure state until the building is reoccupied or made available for immediate occupancy. If the owner demonstrates that securing of the building will provide adequate protection to the public, the director may waive the requirement of an enclosure. 
b.  For buildings and premises thereof that the director determines as being or containing public nuisances, as defined in section 18-1028, then the vacant building plan shall contain a plan of action to remedy such public nuisance(s). 
c.  A time schedule identifying a date of commencement of repair and date of completion of repair for each improperly secured opening and nuisance identified by the director.

Sec. 22-827. - Findings. 
The Village Board has received and reviewed substantial evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented at a hearing and in reports made available to the Village Board, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and North Avenue Novelties, Incorporated v. City of Chicago, 88 F3d 441 (7thh Cir.), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Houston, Texas, Indianapolis, Indiana, Amarillo, Texas, Garden Grove, California, Los Angeles, California, Whittier, California, Austin, Texas, Seattle, Washington, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Ohio, and Beaumont, Texas, and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota). Based on such information, the Village Board finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities, such as prostitution and muggings (study conducted in Beaumont, Texas), that are typically uncontrolled by the licensees of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism in the Village to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  The final report of the U.S. Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1985) (at pages 1473-1476) found that sexual acts occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles at sexually oriented businesses encourages sexual activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. (Report by Community Defense Counsel, Protecting Communities from Sexually Oriented Businesses, November 2002). 
(6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 there have been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States and in Illinois. (U.S. Centers for Disease Control HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report: HIV Infection and AIDS in the United States, 2003, IDPH HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, April 2005.) 
(8)  According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, as of April 2005, there have been 31, 789 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Illinois since 1981. As of April 2005, there have been 13,305 newly reported cases of HIV in Illinois. 
(9)  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-third of a million cases being reported in 2003. 
(10)  The Surgeon General of the United States, in a report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(11)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. According to the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior, dated July 9, 2001, nearly two-thirds of the 774,467 AIDS cases reported since 1987 were sexually transmitted. 
(12)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the licensees of the establishments to self-regulate those activities and maintain the facilities within their establishments. 
(13)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(14)  Studies have shown that arrests for sexual crimes and locations of adult businesses are directly related (Phoenix, Arizona Planning Committee, 1979), and that significantly higher crime rates were associated with an area containing multiple adult businesses (Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1980, and Austin, Texas Special Program Division Report on Adult Oriented Businesses in Austin, 1986). 
(15)  Studies have shown that adult entertainment businesses located in residential areas tend to experience increased crime frequency compared to adult entertainment businesses in commercial areas (study by the Indianapolis Division of Planning, Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis: An Analysis (1984)). 
(16)  The findings noted in subsections (1) through (15) above raise substantial governmental concerns for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens who live and work in, and visit, the Village. 
(17)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the holders of sexually oriented business licenses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the holders of sexually oriented business licenses to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Village. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and the activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on video or live-viewing booths and requiring lighting of sufficient intensity to illuminate the video or live-viewing booth to not less than ten foot candles as measured at the floor level, advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article XXIII is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article XXIII. 
(24)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the Village will be promoted by the enactment of this article XXIII.

(Ord. No. 4818, § 2, 12-6-2005)

(4)  Testing . 
a.  Qualifications of testing personnel. All tests shall be conducted, documented, and signed by a person in possession of a current FCC general radiotelephone operator license. All test records shall be retained at the inspected premises by the building owner and a copy submitted to the Village within 30 days of when the test has been conducted. In the event the test shall fail to comply with the minimum requirements of the Village, appropriate modifications and/or repairs shall be made and additional tests conducted until tests meet the minimum requirements of the Village. 
b.  Testing procedure. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately 20 equal areas. A maximum of two nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. In the event that three of the areas fail the test, in order to be more statically accurate the floor may be divided into 40 equal areas. In such event, a maximum of four nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the 40 area tests, if the system continues to fail the property owner shall repair, replace, alter, or upgrade the system altered to meet the DAQ 3 coverage requirement. Talk testing from site to the Village Public Safety Communications Center shall use a two watt portable transceiver with speaker/microphone and flexible antenna. A spot located approximately in the center of the grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communication to and from the outside of the building. Once the spot has been selected, use of another spot with the grid area will not be permitted. Field strength testing instruments are to be recently calibrated (within the past 12 months) and of the frequency selective type incorporating a flexible antenna similar to the ones used on the hand held transceivers. 
c.  Gain values. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the results kept on file with the property owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the property owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 
d.  Acceptance testing. Acceptance testing for an in-building radio amplification system is required. 
e.  Annual testing. When an in-building radio system is installed, the property owner shall test all active components of the system including but not limited to amplifier, the power supplies, and back-up batteries, a minimum of once every 12 months. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. Back-up batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will operate during an actual power outage. All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturers specifications for the intended purpose. 
f.  Ten-year testing. In addition to the annual test, the property owner shall perform a radio coverage test a minimum of once every ten years to ensure that the radio system continues to meet the requirements of the original acceptance. The procedure set forth above shall apply to such tests. 
(5)  Maintenance responsibilities. 
a.  Maintenance contract. Upon completion of all the tests to the minimum standards of the village, the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the system. Upon request by the Village Manager or his designee, the property owner shall furnish a maintenance contract including the name(s) of the contractor(s), who will supply a 24-hour, 7-day emergency response within two hours after notification by either the village or the property owner. 
b.  System maintenance. The property owner shall be responsible for making any repairs, replacements, or upgrades to the systems should the system fail to meet testing specifications. 
(d)  Obstruction of existing and planned public safety communications microwave paths. 
(1)  New or modified buildings or structures comprised of six stories or greater may not interrupt the microwave paths connecting facilities which comprise the Village's public safety communications infrastructure. Prior to obtaining a permit for such construction or modifications, the property owner shall furnish proof to the Village Manager or his designee in the form of a registered engineer's certification that the structure will not interfere with the present microwave path or any planned path.

The appearance commission shall, at the written request of a prospective applicant for a certificate of appropriateness, give consideration to preliminary exterior drawings, sketches, landscape and site plans, and materials on a specific project before a formal application is filed, and shall provide such advice, counsel, suggestions and recommendations on matters pertaining to aesthetics as they may deem necessary to guide the prospective applicant in the development of a plan which would comply with the requirements and purposes of the appearance plan, except that the appearance commission shall act in an advisory capacity only with regard to preliminary plans, and shall provide consultation only on projects for which preliminary drawings and materials are furnished by the prospective applicant, and shall not participate in the development of the basic concept, plans or drawings. All hearings on preliminary plans are to be public, and are to be held in accordance with the provisions and requirements provided for in subsection (c) of this section. Upon finding the preliminary exterior drawings, sketches, landscape and site plans, and materials are appropriate to, or compatible with, the character of the immediate neighborhood and will tend to affect the general purposes of the appearance plan, the appearance commission will issue a preliminary approval. The approval will be irrevocable, and makes the issuance of the certificate of appropriateness mandatory upon application, unless the final presentation does not comply in all respects with the preliminary presentation upon which the preliminary approval was based. 
(c)  Hearing. Coincidental with the filing of an application for a building permit or for permission to work on any elements in any of the jurisdictional areas of the appearance commission for which a certificate of appropriateness is required under subsection (a) of this section, the applicant shall file a written application for such certificate of appropriateness, on forms provided for such purpose, with the office of the building and zoning director not later than seven days prior to any regularly scheduled hearing of the appearance commission for consideration by them. Upon such hearing, the appearance commission shall consider the application for a certificate of appropriateness and, if necessary, receive additional evidence (such as exterior elevation renderings) and statements from the applicant, his agent or attorney, and from Village personnel or other persons as to whether the external architectural features of the proposed building or structure, or other improvement, comply with the appearance plan. At the request of any member of the appearance commission, testimony given at such hearing shall be under oath. 
(d)  Action of appearance commission. If preliminary consideration has not been requested under the terms and provisions of subsection (b) of this section, prior to making its decision, the appearance commission may make recommendations to the applicant as to changes in the exterior drawings, sketches, landscaping, site plans and materials which, in the judgment of the appearance commission, would tend to effect the general purposes of the appearance plan. The appearance commission shall make its decision within 15 days after the hearing is closed and shall issue to the building and zoning director a certificate of appropriateness, unless the appearance commission finds that the plan does not conform to the appearance plan and that the proposed building or structure will be inappropriate to, or incompatible with, the character of the immediate neighborhood and cause substantial depreciation in property values. If preliminary hearings have been held on the project for which application is being made, and preliminary approval has been issued by the appearance commission as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the appearance commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness immediately, provided that the final drawings, plans and materials as presented comply in all respects with the preliminary presentation upon which the preliminary approval was based. 
(e)  Denial by appearance commission. The appearance commission shall not deny a certificate of appropriateness, except upon the concurring vote of three members. 
(f)  Appeals. All final decisions of the appearance commission under this section shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, and all amendments and modifications thereof, 735 ILCS.5/3-101 et seq.). 
(g)  Administrative approvals. Requests for approval regarding the elements identified in this subsection may be administratively approved by the director of community development and a certificate of appropriateness issued without appearing before the appearance commission. In lieu of the provisions of this subsection, the director of community development reserves the right but not the obligation to forward any request for approval of elements described by this subsection to the appearance commission for formal consideration. 
(1)  Minor architectural changes to buildings and/or tenant spaces including replacement and/or modification of doors, windows, storefront systems, and/or hardware if such replacement and/or modification is comprised of materials, finishes, and colors which match the existing architectural features and approximate rough openings of the building and/or tenant space. 
(2)  Landscape substitutions for diseased, dead, dying, and infested plant materials subject to review and approval of the director of public works or other village manager designee. 
(3)  Extensions to or replacement of fencing comprised of materials, finishes, and colors which match the previously installed fencing in locations permitted by section 98-213. 
(4)  Awnings without signage and comprised of a single color, when designed in compliance with the awning design guidelines and with the structural requirements of section 18-192. 
(5)  Signage for any tenant space within a shopping center with shopping center sign design guidelines previously approved by the appearance commission which is designed in compliance with said shopping center sign design guidelines and the requirements of chapter 98, article VII, signs, the wall sign design guidelines, single-tenant ground sign design guidelines, multi-tenant ground sign design guidelines, downtown sign design guidelines, and glen town center tenant design criteria, as applicable.

Sec. 54-66. - Followup by building and zoning director. 
(a)  Upon the granting of a certificate of appropriateness, the exterior drawings, sketches, landscape and site plans, renderings and materials upon which the certificate was granted shall be turned over to the building and zoning director, whose responsibility it shall be to determine, from time to time as the project is in progress and finally upon its completion, that there have been no unauthorized deviations from the evidence upon which the granting of the certificate of appropriateness was originally based. 
(b)  It shall be the duty of the person to whom a certificate of appropriateness has been granted to comply with the requirements of the certificate of appropriateness and to obtain such inspections as may be necessary in order to assure such compliance. The building and zoning director will notify such person of any deficiencies found to exist. Failure to correct any deficiency within ten days after notification of such deficiency will constitute a violation of this article. 
(c)  When, by reason of nonavailability of planting materials or any other valid circumstance, it becomes necessary to vary any of the provisions under which a certificate of appropriateness has been granted and, in the opinion of the building and zoning director, such variation will be aesthetically equal to or be better than the original provisions and will not conflict with the intent of the appearance plan, the building and zoning director shall have the power to grant such variation. To the extent that the building and zoning director exercises such power, within 30 days thereafter, he shall submit a written report of the circumstances to the appearance commission. 
(d)  Before any use may be made of improvements constructed under the provisions of this article, a final inspection of the premises must be obtained from the building and zoning director, who will consider his findings in matters under the jurisdiction of the appearance commission, together with other codes, in the issuance of an occupancy certificate. An occupancy certificate will not be issued unless such an inspection has been made and the completed work found to be in compliance with plans approved by the appearance commission and under which the certificate of appropriateness was issued, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section. 
(e)  If it should become impossible, by reason of weather, strike or any other circumstance beyond the control of the person to whom the certificate of appropriateness has been granted, to complete all work required before occupancy or start of use, a temporary occupancy permit may be granted upon either the depositing with the Village of a sufficient cash escrow to guarantee completion of the work or upon the execution of an agreement, in a form satisfactory to the Village manager, in which the applicant shall be firmly bound to comply with the terms, provisions and conditions of the certificate of appropriateness as soon as the circumstances causing such impossibility shall have been abated. Refunds of such cash escrow may be made progressively as work is completed or in a lump sum upon final inspection and approval by the building and zoning director. 
(f)  If the person to whom the certificate of appropriateness has been granted fails to complete the work required in accordance with provisions under which the cash escrow amount set forth in subsection (e) of this section has been deposited within nine months of the date of such escrow deposit, the cash deposit shall be forfeited and the Village shall use all or part of such deposit as may be required to complete work in accordance with drawings submitted and approved by the appearance commission, and under which a certificate of appropriateness and certain permits have been granted. The nine-month time limit may be extended by the building and zoning director if, in his opinion, it is in the public interest to do so. In the event of such forfeiture, the person to whom the certificate of appropriateness has been granted shall only be entitled to the refund of that portion, if any, of the cash deposit that remains in escrow after completion of the work entailed. 
(Code 1959, § 25.8)  
Sec. 54-67. - Amendments.

The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the appearance commission, by rules, may provide. 
(c)  Report by appearance commission. Following such hearing, and within 180 days after the filing with the building and zoning director of the application for amendment, the appearance commission shall transmit to the board of trustees a written report giving its findings and recommendations for action to be taken by the board of trustees in regard to the application. If no such report is transmitted within 180 days of the filing of the application, the appearance commission shall be deemed to have recommended that the application be denied, unless the petitioner has, prior to the expiration of such 180 days, requested and has been granted a stipulated extension of time by the appearance commission. 
(d)  Action by board of trustees. After receiving the report of the appearance commission, the board of trustees may enact the amendment with or without change, or may reject it, or may refer it back to the appearance commission for further consideration.

ARTICLE IV. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 
 
Sec. 54-81. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  Site plan review is a procedure for the review of proposed developments or redevelopments to ensure they are compatible with adjacent development by taking into account the relationship of the new development to its surroundings. The purpose of site plan review is to go beyond the basic zoning, subdivision, design and building requirements in order to address site details which the other codes adopted in this chapter may not regulate. It should be noted that site plan review is in addition to, and not an exception from, other required procedures under Village ordinances, including, but not limited to, those established by article III of chapter 18 pertaining to the building code, article III of this chapter pertaining to the appearance plan, chapter 66 pertaining to subdivisions and chapter 98 pertaining to zoning. Instead, it augments these regulations in order to promote more orderly and harmonious development. It is also intended to ensure, generally, that all codes and ordinances have been met and to provide a logical and coordinated review of proposed developments. 
(b)  In conducting a site plan review of a proposed development, the following elements of the development are examined: 
(1)  Parking arrangement and location. 
(2)  Site circulation, pedestrian and vehicular. 
(3)  Traffic and driveway access. 
(4)  Building location on the site. 
(5)  Transitions to adjacent properties. 
(6)  Drainage and stormwater detention. 
(7)  Environmental impact and open space, including existing vegetation. 
(8)  Intensity of use. 
(9)  Building massing, scale and relationship to surrounding development. 
(10)  Impact on provision of Village services, including public safety and infrastructure demands. 
(c)  Specific building and landscaping design and materials are not examined, for such details are addressed as part of the required appearance commission review. Instead, the focus is on the aspects of site planning as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  In addition to upgrading site planning through the site plan review, the Village hopes to create a process, which will expedite the review of development proposals, by addressing the fundamental details of site planning early in the review process. By providing a forum for the communication of Village requirements and applicable policy documents and plans, it is hoped that costly delays may be avoided. During the site plan review, there is an opportunity for direct communication between the developer, Village staff, the plan commission and the Village Board prior to the preparation of final plans. 
(e)  Finally, given the essentially developed nature of the Village, it is intended that site plan review should help minimize adverse impact on, protect and enhance property values of and promote compatibility with adjacent development and surroundings. 
(Code 1959, § 25.13)  
Sec. 54-82. - Developments requiring approval; exemptions. 
(a)  The following developments require final site plan approval prior to the issuance of building permits for the development: 
(1)  Any use in the business, limited commercial, light industrial, public land or hospital district that results in the construction of a new building or structure, major modifications to the exterior dimensions of an existing building or structure (including building additions), alteration in area to a paved parking lot or the addition of or change to a curb cut. 
(2)  All new multifamily dwellings or conversions of existing buildings to create new multifamily units, including attached single-family residences and townhomes. 
(3)  All nonresidential uses in residential districts that result in construction of a new building or structure, major modifications to the exterior dimensions of an existing building or structure (including building additions), alterations in area to a paved parking lot or the addition of or change to a curb cut. 
(4)  All planned developments. 
(5)  Single-family subdivisions which will result in more than two lots. 
(b)  Uses determined by the director of community development as having no land use impact and which are consistent with the intent of this article as set forth in section 54-81(a) shall be exempt from the requirements of this article. Additionally, the following site plan changes shall be eligible for administrative approval by the director of community development: 
(1)  Parking lot improvements comprised of 25 or fewer parking stalls which comprise fewer than five-percent of the quantity of existing parking stalls upon any property which would include a sufficient quantity of parking stalls onsite for the existing and/or proposed uses on the property as required by code upon completion of the improvements, would include no impacts to the land use or site circulation, and otherwise have no outstanding staff review comments. 
(2)  Building additions comprised of up to 3,000 square feet which comprise less than five-percent of the total existing building square footage upon any property provided the building additions would include no impacts to the land use or site circulation, and otherwise have no outstanding staff review comments. 
(3)  The director of planning can require appearance before the plan commission for any project which he/she does not feel meets the intent of the above requirements. 
(4)  Once quarterly, the director of community development shall forward a list of all administrative approvals granted in accordance with this section to the plan commission for their information. 
(c)  Uses in the P-1 district which are subject to a conditional use public hearing conducted by the Village Board of trustees shall be exempt from the requirements of this article. 
(d)  Uses specified in section 98-135(a)(2), not otherwise authorized on the ground floor of an existing building, or addition or expansion thereto, located in a D-1 downtown district, may be permitted to occupy such ground floor space by approval of the plan commission and Village Board under the site plan approval process established in this article, but only in accordance with the permitted use requirements established in section 98-135(a)(1).

Sec. 54-83. - Procedures. 
(a)  Preliminary conference (development meeting). Prior to filing an application for site plan review with the director of development, an applicant shall request and attend a development meeting with the Village staff to obtain all necessary filing information and have the procedures for review explained. 
(b)  Preliminary review. Within 21 days of filing a complete application, including all information as shall be required from time to time by the Village, for site plan review with the director of development, the applicant shall attend a preliminary site plan review conference with the Village staff. The purpose of the conference is to acquaint the Village staff with the proposal and convey the concerns of those participating early in the process, when designs are still flexible and refinements and adjustments are possible. The preliminary site plan review is also intended to assist the applicant in bringing the site plan into conformance with the requirements of this article and other applicable regulations. The staff will also review the application for completeness and apply the evaluation criteria set forth in subsection (c) of this section. The review will form the basis of the staff report, which will be considered by the plan commission and board of trustees as part of final site plan review. 
(c)  Final review. 
(1)  Final site plan review approval by the plan commission is required for all developments specified in section 54-82. The final site plan review shall be scheduled by filing with the director of development the necessary number of site plans as may be established by departmental procedure. Such submittal shall accompany the necessary applications and other required documents for rezoning, subdivision, conditional use, variation and/or annexation, if applicable. If the applicant elects, final site plan approval may be considered in conjunction with preliminary subdivision approval. 
(2)  Upon receipt of the information required in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the director of development shall circulate the application for staff review and cause a staff report to be prepared for transmittal to the plan commission. The director of development shall also schedule the matter for consideration by the plan commission at the next available meeting, taking into account procedural requirements for other related approvals, if applicable. 
(3)  Within 60 days of the submission to the director of development of a completed application for final site plan review approval, the proposed development shall appear on a plan commission agenda to determine compliance with the evaluation criteria as established in section 54-85. The plan commission shall consider the application at one or more meetings and then forward its recommendation to the board of trustees for final action. The plan commission and board of trustees shall make one of the following decisions on the matter: 
a.  The proposed site plan satisfies the evaluation criteria established in section 54-85 and is therefore approved. 
b.  The proposed site plan, with specific modifications, could satisfy the evaluation criteria and is therefore approved, conditionally. 
c.  The proposed site plan does not satisfy the evaluation criteria and is therefore disapproved. 
(4)  One copy of the site plan will be marked with the final decision of the Village Board and returned to the applicant and one copy will be placed in the Village case file on the matter. Upon approval of the final site plan, the applicant may seek and the Village may issue a building permit for the proposed development, provided all other Village requirements are satisfied.

The goals and objectives of the Village comprehensive general plan and other applicable Village planning and policy documents shall be utilized in the review of proposed site plans. In addition, the following criteria shall also be used to determine whether a proposed site plan fulfills the requirements of this article: 
(1)  Building and structure locations. The arrangements of the structures on the site shall allow for the effective and efficient use of the proposed development. Such arrangement shall be compatible and harmonious with development on adjacent property. The arrangement of structures on the site shall be evaluated to ensure effective and efficient provision of municipal services. In the downtown and downtown frame area, the site plan shall embody a pedestrian orientation, generally represented by a building location at or near the street, with parking at the rear. 
(2)  Building scale. The scale of the proposed building must be appropriate to the site, location and function of the site. The building scale must promote harmonious transitions to adjacent developments and land uses. 
(3)  Open space. The proposed development should be designed to maximize the preservation of natural site features, including vegetation, drainage and topography. The landscape treatment of exterior open spaces should enhance the quality of the project and create a desirable and functional environment for patrons, visitors and occupants. Stormwater detention facilities should be integrated into the proposed site design to provide functional and attractive open space. The amount of open space provided shall be appropriate to the proposed use and compatible with surrounding development. Excessive lot coverage shall be prohibited, notwithstanding the amount of such coverage permitted by chapter 98 pertaining to zoning. 
(4)  Landscaping:. Landscape design shall provide an aesthetically pleasing design, create a logical transition to adjoining development, screen incompatible uses, screen unsightly activities from public view and break up large expanses of asphalt with plant materials. Existing mature trees and shrubs should be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. Plant materials shall be selected so as to withstand the Village's climatic conditions and the specific constraints imposed by adjacent functions. 
(5)  Graphics and signage. Signs and other site graphics shall be minimized in size and number to promote their effectiveness. Such signs and site graphics shall be integrated with architectural and site landscape features. 
(6)  Circulation. All site circulation systems, vehicular and pedestrian, shall provide adequate and safe access to the site. Dangerous traffic movements will be prohibited and curb cuts shall be minimized. Disruption of traffic flows on adjacent streets and undue congestion shall be minimized or avoided. Connections and linkages with adjacent developments are encouraged to promote logical circulation patterns and minimize curb cuts. 
(7)  Parking lots. Proposed parking lots shall be designed, located and screened to minimize visual impact on adjacent properties. Such parking shall also be designed and located to minimize the number of curb cuts. Shared parking lot access shall be promoted, where practical. Perimeter screening is encouraged and interior lot landscaping shall be provided to break up large expanses of asphalt with plant and other landscape materials. 
(8)  Site illumination. Site illumination shall be designed, located and installed in such a manner that will minimize adverse impact on adjacent properties. 
(9)  Preservation. Preservation of unique architectural, cultural, environmental or historical resources is encouraged. Development designs and treatments that respect such desirable resources on adjacent properties are also encouraged.

(Code 1959, § 18.13.2)  
Sec. 66-293. - Park and recreational site land dedication requirements. 
(a)  Calculation of amount. The amount of land required to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes for a proposed subdivision shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of the subdivision. The requirement shall be based on a standard of five acres of land per 1,000 ultimate population, computed in accordance with section 66-292. 
(b)  Location. The location of land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes for the proposed subdivision shall be determined by the board of trustees, in cooperation with the Village park district board, and shall be located within the Village corporate limits. The Village comprehensive plan and the park district comprehensive plan shall both be used as guidelines for locating the park sites, the acreage of the park sites, as well as the type or classification of the park. Additional factors utilized to determine the suitability of park locations shall include, but not be limited to, the: 
(1)  Availability of land; 
(2)  Suitability of the land for park and recreational purposes; 
(3)  Location of the land relative to population concentrations; and 
(4)  Proximity of the land to other parks and recreational land. 
(c)  Minimum size. The minimum size of any land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be two acres (87,120 square feet), and no dimension shall be less than 100 feet; provided, however, that the board of trustees may approve dedications of a smaller size or dimension when required by the specific plans of the proposed subdivision and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is clearly demonstrated. 
(d)  Stormwater detention and retention areas. No stormwater detention or retention area shall qualify as land suitable for dedication for park and recreational purposes, unless the suitability of such land for park and recreational purposes as a secondary use is clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees and the Village park district board. 
(e)  Private open space and recreational area credit. 
(1)  When applicants, as subdividers or developers, provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it may have the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services. 
(2)  Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option of the Village Board, be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space. The extent thereof shall be determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area. 
(3)  In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment, by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the Village, and, before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that the private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private swimming clubs are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given. 
(Code 1959, § 18.3.3)  
Sec. 66-294. - School site land dedication. 
(a)  Calculation of amount. 
(1)  The amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites for a proposed subdivision shall be a direct function of the ultimate number of students to be generated by the subdivision. The school site land dedication requirement shall be determined in accordance with the following equation: 
The number of children from the proposed subdivision to be served in each school classification (computed in accordance with the table set forth in section 66-292. 
Divided by: 
The maximum number of students to be served in each such school classification (as stated in subsection (b) of this section) 
Multiplied by: 
The minimum number of acres for each school site for each such school classification (as stated in subsection (b) of this section) 
(2)  The product of such calculation shall be the minimum acreage of land necessary for school sites to serve the children in the proposed subdivision. 
_____
(b)  School classifications and required minimum size. School classifications and the required minimum size of new school sites within the Village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School Classification by Grades 	Maximum Number of Students For Each School Classification 	Minimum Number of Acres of Land Per Site For Each Classification 
Elementary schools 
Grades K6 	  600 	11 
Junior high schools 
Grades 78 	  900 	29 
High schools 
Grades 912 	2,300 	55 
 
(c)  Location. The location of each school site shall be determined by the board of trustees, in cooperation with the affected school district board, and shall be located within the Village corporate limits. The Village comprehensive plan and the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as guidelines in locating school sites.

Sec. 66-295. - Cash contribution in lieu of park and school land dedication. 
(a)  General qualification. If a proposed subdivision is small and the resulting required land dedication is too small, in the determination of the board of trustees, or when the board of trustees finds that the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or for a school site, then the Village shall have the authority to require the applicant to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the otherwise required land dedications, in accordance with the standards of this section. 
(b)  Fair market value determination. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the proposed subdivision, as determined by the board of trustees based on the value of improved land in and surrounding the Village. The fair market value figure shall be set forth in the Village's annual fee ordinance and shall be used in making any calculation required by this section, unless the applicant or other affected party files an objection pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The Village manager or his designate shall periodically, but no less frequently than annually, survey surrounding communities, conduct discussions with the applicable township assessor's office, affected school districts and other interested parties, and shall report findings of such surveys and communications to the board of trustees with respect to the continued adequacy and reasonableness of the Village's determination of fair market value as set forth in the annual fee ordinance. 
(c)  Improved land. For the purposes of this section, the term "improved land" means a parcel or lot which has prepared for development by grading, draining or installing public utilities or improvements, such as a sanitary sewer, drainage conveyance system, stormwater detention/retention or compensatory storage area, water main, street, parkway, parkway trees, sidewalk or other facility. Such improvements may be on-site or off-site. 
(d)  Objection to fair market value determination. If the applicant or any other affected person files a written objection with the Village manager or his designate to the fair market value as established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and as set forth in the annual fee ordinance, the applicant or other affected person shall submit, at their sole cost and expense, a certified appraisal, professionally prepared by a member of the Appraisal Institute of America (MAI). The appraisal shall show the fair market value of improved land in the area of the proposed subdivision. Upon receipt of such objection, the Village manager or his designate shall cause the objection to be delivered to the Village park district and/or the applicable school district, and the affected district shall have the right, but not the obligation, within 30 days after receipt of the objection by the Village manager or his designate, to make a recommendation regarding the disposition of such objection. The board of trustees shall make the final determination as to the fair market value of such improved land, which final determination shall be based on the appraisal or other information submitted by the applicant, the recommendations, if any, received from the Village park district and the applicable school district, and all other facts and circumstances relevant to the issue as determined and required by the board of trustees. All costs incurred by the Village in the consideration of the objection to the fair market value determination shall be paid by the applicant prior to the issuance of the first building permit of the subdivision. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting or preventing the board of trustees from utilizing the fair market value as established in subsection (b) of this section for any proposed subdivision. 
(e)  Disposition. 
(1)  Cash contributions to benefit parks and schools in lieu of land dedication shall be made to the appropriate school district and/or the Village park district by the applicant at the time of the permit application for residential construction. In no case shall any occupancy permits be issued for the affected subdivision/planned development plat unless or until the cash contribution is made and proof thereof is provided to the Village. 
(2)  Cash contributions in lieu of park land dedication shall be used by the Village park district solely for use in the acquisition, expansion or development of park and recreational land and facilities in the Village park district neighborhood, community or urban parks, to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision, and shall not be used for general capital improvements to such district. 
(3)  Cash contributions in lieu of school site land dedications shall be used by the applicable school district solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of students from the proposed subdivision or the improvement or expansion to any existing school site already serving such needs and shall not be used for general capital improvements to such district. 
(f)  Refunds. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of a park land dedication or a cash contribution in lieu of a school site land dedication, as the case may be, is not expended for the purposes set forth in this section within ten years after the date of receipt of such contribution by the appropriate school or park district, then the cash contribution shall be refunded to the applicant who made such contribution, or the applicant's successor or assign. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.5)  
Sec. 66-296. - Combination of land dedication and cash contribution in lieu of land dedication. 
A combination of land dedication and cash contribution in lieu of land dedication may be required, when appropriate, as determined by the board of trustees, including, without limitation, when: 
(1)  Inadequate land. The proposed subdivision has some, but not enough, adequate land to meet the dedication requirements of this division. The portion of the land within the proposed subdivision that is adequate for park land or a school site shall be dedicated as provided in this division, and a cash contribution shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this division. 
(2)  Previous acquisition. A major part of the local park or recreational site, or school site already has been acquired and only a small parcel of land is needed from the proposed subdivision to complete the site. Such parcel shall be acquired by dedication, and a cash contribution shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this division. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.6)  
Sec. 66-297. - Reservation of additional land. 
When the Village comprehensive plan or other applicable standard of the Village requires a larger amount of park and recreational land or a larger school site in a particular subdivision than the applicant is otherwise required to dedicate pursuant to the terms of this division, the land needed in excess of the otherwise required dedication shall then be reserved by the applicant for subsequent purchase by the Village or applicable other public body, provided that such acquisition is started within one year after the date of approval of the final plat for the proposed subdivision. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.7)  
Sec. 66-298. - Combining with adjoining subdivisions. 
For proposed subdivisions of 40 acres or less, the otherwise applicable park and recreational land dedication or school site land dedication may be combined, where practical, as determined by the board of trustees, with dedications for the same purposes from adjoining subdivisions or developments to produce usable parks or recreational areas, or school sites. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.8)  
Sec. 66-299. - Topography and grading. 
The slope, topography and geology of a site to be dedicated pursuant to the requirements of this division, as well as its surroundings, shall be suitable for the intended purpose of the site. Grading on dedicated land shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.9)  
Sec. 66-300. - Improved sites. 
All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, telecommunications, gas, water, sewer and streets, including curb and gutter, and enclosed drainage, as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provisions shall be made therefor. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.10)  
Sec. 66-301. - Condition of annexation. 
Unless waived by the board of trustees, in its sole and absolute discretion, the dedication of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof, required by this division, also shall be required as a condition of the annexation of any land to the Village for residential purposes. However, such dedications or payments shall not be required as a condition of an amendment to an annexation agreement unless the board of trustees finds, from a consideration of the purposes of this division, that such dedications or payments should be required because of increased burdens to be placed on schools and the park system over and above those covered by the dedications and cash contributions made or provided for in connection with the original annexation agreement. If the board of trustees makes such finding, then additional dedications or cash contributions shall be required, but only to the extent necessary to cover the shortage resulting from such increased burdens. Dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof as specified in any annexation agreement that substantially complies with the requirements of this division shall be deemed to have fulfilled the dedication requirements of this division. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.11)  
Sec. 66-302. - Dedication as condition of approval of final plat. 
Approval of any final plat of a subdivision or planned development plat shall be conditioned on the dedication of land or cash contribution in lieu thereof, as required by this division. When a subdivision is to be developed over a period of years, dedication of required land may be made after completion of a portion of the subdivision, provided that an escrow fund, satisfactory to the Village, has been established to guarantee the conveyance of land after completion of such portion of the subdivision. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.12)  
Sec. 66-303. - Title to dedicated park land and school sites. 
(a)  General requirement. All sites to be dedicated pursuant to this division shall be conveyed to the Village either by warranty or trustee's deed, or such form of conveyance as the Village shall require. The applicant shall be responsible for payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance, including any agricultural rollback taxes that might be extended or levied against such sites. In the discretion of the Village, a commitment for title insurance, issued by a company authorized to do business in the State, will be required as evidence of clear title. 
(b)  Park land. Conveyance of park land dedications shall occur only after or simultaneously with the passage of an ordinance or resolution by the Village park district, or by the Village if the subdivision is not located within the Village park district, in which it indicates that the land will be accepted by the park district or the Village, as the case may be, for park purposes. If the land is in the park district, then immediately after the adoption of the park district resolution or ordinance, the Village shall convey the land to the park district. 
(c)  School sites. Conveyance of school sites shall occur only after or simultaneously with the passage of an ordinance or resolution by the school district in which the subdivision is located, in which the district indicates that the site will be accepted by the district for school purposes. Immediately thereafter, the Village shall convey the site to the district. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.13)  
Sec. 66-304. - Intergovernmental agreement. 
The Village park district and the affected school districts shall be required, as a condition of receiving the dedications or donations under this division, to enter into a binding, written intergovernmental agreement with the Village, acceptable in form and content by the Village attorney, providing for the indemnification and holding harmless of the Village from any loss, claim and cause of action of every kind that may be incurred by the Village as a result, either directly or indirectly, of the enactment of the ordinance from which this division is derived, or the administration or enforcement thereof, including any loss, claim or cause of action incurred as a result of a lawsuit brought or threatened against the Village park district or the affected school district. The intergovernmental agreement shall provide that if the Village is sued by any applicant, subdivider or developer as a result, directly or indirectly, of the enactment of the ordinance from which this division is derived, the Village may, at its option, undertake the defense, and the Village's costs and expenses related thereto, including attorneys' fees, shall be immediately reimbursed by the Village park district and/or affected school district, as the case may be. 
(Code 1959, § 18.13.14)  
Sec. 66-305. - Waiver of requirement. 
The dedication of land or cash contribution in lieu thereof as required by this division shall be applicable unless the board of trustees determines either that such new subdivision will not in itself have an impact upon or create a need for new school and/or park facilities and that any such need is not uniquely attributable to such new subdivision. The determination by the Village Board shall be binding upon all of the parties involved.

Such notice shall be in a form provided by the Village and shall be given by regular first class U.S. Mail. For purposes of this subsection, a notice addressed to the name and address on the most recent Cook County tax records shall be deemed a satisfaction of the notice requirement. Furthermore, for purposes of this subsection, a lot or parcel of land shall be deemed to "abut" an Infill Construction Site if the lot or parcel of land shares a common boundary or point with the Infill Construction Site, or is separated from the Infill Construction Site by only a public or private right-of-way. The applicant shall file with the Village, within 14 days after the filing of the permit application; written certification that such notice has been properly delivered. Such certification shall be in a form provided by the Village. The Village shall not process, and shall return to the applicant, any permit application for which such notice was not given or for which such certification was not filed as provided in this subsection 66-309(a)(1). Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed as prohibiting the director of development or their designee from providing notice of contemplated Infill Construction work that is not specifically covered or required by this subparagraph. 
(b)  In the event that written notice has been provided pursuant to subsection 66-309(a) and the applicant desires to make any changes that significantly alter the amount of Impervious Surface on the approved final engineering plan or the approved grading and drainage plan submitted pursuant to subsection 66-309(a) of this chapter, which changes are necessitated by on-site conditions not reasonably anticipated when the final engineering plan was submitted for review and approval by the Village engineer, the applicant shall provide written notice of such changes in a manner conforming with subsection 66-309(a). 
(c)  Prior to the commencement of any Infill Construction on any Infill Construction Site that contemplates a net cumulative increase in impervious surface of less than 400 square feet in area, if determined by the director of development or their designee to be in an area of known drainage issues, the applicant shall provide written notice of his or her filing of an application for a permit in the same manner as provided in subsection 66-309(a) to the owners or occupants of all lots or parcels of land that abut the Infill Construction Site and to any other persons or entities that the director of development or their designee determines appropriate. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed as prohibiting the director of development or their designee from providing notice of contemplated Infill Construction work that is not specifically covered or required by this subparagraph.

Sec. 70-311. - Definitions. 
The following, words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Act means the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act, 35 ILCS 636/5-1, et seq., as amended from time to time. 
Amount paid means the amount charged to the taxpayer's service address in the Village regardless of where such amount is billed or paid. 
Department means the Illinois Department of Revenue. 
Gross charge means the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the Village and for all services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination point within the Village and charges for the portion of the inter-office channels provided within the Village. Charges for that portion of the inter-office channel connecting two or more channel termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional boundary of the Village, shall be determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the inter-office channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the Village and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points connected by the inter-office channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include: 
(1)  Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made pursuant to: 
a.  The tax imposed by this article;

(2)  Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside of the Village; 
(3)  Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or information intended to change its form or content. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, the use of calculators, computers, data processing equipment, tabulating equipment or accounting equipment and also includes the usage of computers under a time-sharing agreement; 
(4)  Charges for customer equipment, including such equipment that is leased or rented by the customer from any source, wherein such charges are disaggregated and separately identified from other charges; 
(5)  Charges to business enterprises certified as exempt under Section 9-222.1 of the Public Utilities Act to the extent of such exemption and during the period of time specified by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity; 
(6)  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries or between wholly-owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly-owned subsidiaries or between wholly-owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service; 
(7)  "Bad debts," meaning any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable Federal Income Tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made; 
(8)  Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication devices; 
(9)  Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act; or 
(10)  Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if (a) those charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are taxable, (b) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or invoice, and (c) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the retailer of the telecommunications. 
Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate or terminate outside this State. 
Intrastate telecommunications means all telecommunications that originate and terminate within this State. 
Person means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed by order of any court, the Federal and State governments, including State universities created by statute, or any city, town, county, or other political subdivision of this State. 
Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The Department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this State, who, to the satisfaction of the Department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this State in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this State. The permit may be revoked by the Department at its discretion. 
Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State, or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this State, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this State under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this State.

Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in this State where bills are sent. 
State means the State of Illinois. 
Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the Village and who incurs a liability for the tax imposed by this article.

As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. 
Village means the Village of Glenview. 
(Ord. No. 5916, § 3, 6-2-2015)  
Sec. 70-312. - Simplified municipal telecommunications tax imposed. 
(a)  A tax is hereby imposed upon the act or privilege of originating in the Village or receiving in the Village intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax. 
(b)  A tax is hereby imposed upon the act or privilege of originating in the Village or receiving in the Village interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state or multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or municipality in this State on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax properly due and paid in a municipality in this State which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this State. 
(c)  The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on the foregoing acts or privileges to the extent such acts or privileges may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the Village.

Sec. 70-313. - Collection of tax by retailers. 
(a)  The tax imposed by this article shall be collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this State and shall be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax imposed by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the manner provided by the Department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax imposed by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications. 
(Ord. No. 5916, § 3, 6-2-2015)  
Sec. 70-314. - Returns to department. 
For the tax imposed under this article, every retailer maintaining a place of business in this State shall, on or before the last day each month, make a return to the Department for the preceding month, stating the information required by Section 5-50 of the Act, and shall make payments to the Department in accordance with the Act. 
(Ord. No. 5916, § 3, 6-2-2015)  
Sec. 70-315. - Resellers. 
(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall State facts which will show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax imposed by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the Department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall: 
(1)  Timely remove the lien at the Village's expense; 
(2)  Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and 
(3)  Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. 
(Ord. No. 4264, § 17, 12-19-2000)

Sec. 90-101. - Limits. 
(a)  No person shall drive any vehicle upon any public highway, roadway or street in the Village at a speed that is greater than reasonable and proper with regard to traffic conditions and the use of the highway, roadway or street, or that endangers the safety of any person or property or is greater than the applicable maximum speed limit established by this subsection or by any regulation of the State or County made pursuant to the provisions of State statute. The maximum speed limit for any motor vehicle on public roadways, streets or highways located within the Village, which streets are solely within the jurisdiction of the Village and are not within the jurisdiction of the State or County, shall be 20 miles per hour, except those public roadways, streets or highways listed in section 90-559 pertaining to speed limits. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching a crossing and intersection, when approaching and going around a curve, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway or when a special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care. 
(b)  The prima facie speed limitations set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to authorized emergency vehicles as defined in section 90-1 when responding to emergency calls and the drivers thereof sound an audible signal by bell, siren or exhaust whistle. This subsection shall not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the roadway, nor shall it protect the driver of any such vehicle from the consequences of a reckless disregard of the safety of others.

(a)  The driver of any vehicle involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting in personal injury to or death of any person shall immediately stop such vehicle at the scene of such accident or as close thereto as possible and shall then forthwith return to, and in every event shall remain at, the scene of the accident until the requirements of section 11-403 have been fulfilled. Every such stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary. 
(b)  Any person who has failed to stop or comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall, as soon as possible, but in no case later than one hour after such motor vehicle accident, or, if hospitalized and incapacitated from reporting at any time during such period, as soon as possible, but in no case later than one hour after being discharged from the hospital, report the place of the accident, the date, the approximate time, the driver's name and address, the registration number of the vehicle driven and the names of all other occupants of such vehicle, at a police station or sheriff's office near the place where such accident occurred.

For purposes of this subsection, the term "personal injury" shall mean any injury requiring immediate professional treatment in a medical facility or doctor's office. 
(c)  The driver of any vehicle involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting only in damage to a vehicle which is driven or attended by any person shall immediately stop such vehicle at the scene of such motor vehicle accident or as close thereto as possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in every event shall remain at, the scene of such motor vehicle accident until the requirements of subsection (d) of this section have been fulfilled. Every such stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary. 
(d)  The driver of any vehicle involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting in injury to or death of any person or damage to any vehicle which is driven or attended by any person shall give the driver's name, address, registration number and owner of the vehicle the driver is operating and shall, upon request and if available, exhibit such driver's license to the person struck or the driver or occupant of or person attending any vehicle collided with and shall render to any person injured in such accident reasonable assistance, including the carrying or the making of arrangements for the carrying of such person to a physician, surgeon or hospital for medical or surgical treatment, if it is apparent that such treatment is necessary or if such carrying is requested by the injured person. If none of the persons entitled to information pursuant to this subsection is in a condition to receive and understand such information and no police officer is present, such driver, after rendering reasonable assistance, shall forthwith report such motor vehicle accident at the nearest office of a duly authorized police authority, disclosing the information required by this subsection. 
(e)  The driver of any vehicle which collides with or is involved in a motor vehicle accident with any vehicle which is unattended or other property, resulting in any damage to such other vehicle or property, shall immediately stop and shall then and there either locate and notify the operator or owner of such vehicle or other property of the driver's name, address, registration number and owner of the vehicle the driver was operating or shall attach securely in a conspicuous place on or in the vehicle or other property struck a written notice giving the driver's name, address, registration number and owner of the vehicle the driver was driving and shall, without unnecessary delay, notify the nearest office of a duly authorized police authority and shall make a written report of such accident when and as required in 625 ILCS 5/11-406.

(Code 1959, § 11.6.2)  
Sec. 90-142. - Stop required at entrance to through roadway. 
The driver of a vehicle shall stop at the entrance to a through roadway and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles which have entered the intersection from such through roadway or which are approaching so closely on such through roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard, but such driver having so yielded may proceed at such time as a safe interval occurs. 
(Code 1959, § 11.6.3)  
Sec. 90-143. - Stop required upon approaching stop signs, etc. 
(a)  Where stop signs or flashing red signals are in place at an intersection or at a plainly marked crosswalk between intersections, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk and pedestrians within or entering the crosswalk at either edge of the roadway shall have the right-of-way over vehicles so stopped. Drivers of vehicles having so yielded the right-of-way to pedestrians entering or within the nearest crosswalk at an intersection shall also yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within any other crosswalk of the intersection. 
(b)  Every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign or stop light shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no clearly marked stop line, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting highway before entering the intersection, except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic control signal.

State Law reference Similar provisions, 625 ILCS 5/11-906.  
Sec. 90-145. - Obedience to signal indicating approach of train. 
(a)  Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until the tracks are clear and he can proceed safely. Such requirements shall apply when: 
(1)  A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train; 
(2)  A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives, or continues to give, a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train; 
(3)  A railroad train approaching a highway crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad train, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an immediate hazard; 
(4)  An approaching railroad train is plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing; 
(5)  A railroad train is approaching so closely that an immediate hazard is created. 
(b)  Whenever a person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not always required to stop but must slow down, the person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this subsection, the driver shall slow down within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he checks that the tracks are clear of an approaching train. 
(c)  No person shall drive any vehicle through, around or under any crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while such gate or barrier is closed or is being opened or closed. 
(d)  At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs, without automatic, electric or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates or a human flagman giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train, the driver of a vehicle shall, in obedience to the railroad crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he can proceed safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad crossing or interferes with the movement of a train after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield the right-of-way. 
(e)  No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient undercarriage clearance.

It shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle in a designated access aisle adjacent to any parking place specifically reserved for persons with disabilities, by the posting of an official sign as designated under 625 ILCS 5/11-301, for motor vehicles displaying such registration plates. When using the parking privileges for persons with disabilities, the parking decal or device must be displayed properly in the vehicle where it is clearly visible to law enforcement personnel, either hanging from the rearview mirror or placed in clear view on the dashboard of the vehicle. An individual with a vehicle properly displaying a person with disabilities license plate or parking decal or device issued to a disabled person under section 90-191 or 625 ILCS 5/3-616 is in violation of this section if the person is not the authorized holder of a person with disabilities license plate or parking decal or device and is not transporting the authorized holder of a person with disabilities license plate or parking decal or device to or from the parking location and the person uses the person with disabilities license plate or parking decal or device to exercise any privileges granted through the person with disabilities license plates or parking decals or devices under this division.

(c)  Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of this section shall be subject to punishment as provided in section 1-16, in addition to any costs or charges connected with the removal or storage of any motor vehicle authorized under this section, but the Village shall display signs indicating the fine imposed. If the amount of the fine is subsequently changed, the Village shall change the sign to indicate the current amount of the fine. It shall not be a defense to a charge under this section that the sign posted pursuant to this section does not comply with the technical requirements of 625 ILCS 5/11-301, State department of transportation regulations or local ordinance, if a reasonable person would be made aware by the sign or notice on or near the parking place that the place is reserved for a person with disabilities.

Any additional stops between the point of origin and the point of destination are expressly prohibited. Single trip permits are effective for five consecutive days from the date of issuance unless otherwise directed by the traffic unit. 
(2)  Round trip movement means two trips over the same route in opposite directions. Round trip permits over a circular or roundabout route will not routinely be issued unless different return routing is necessary due to lower clearance or a deficiency in a structure in the opposite directions. 
(3)  Multiple moves are those in such close proximity to each other in distance or in time that the traffic unit would consider incorporating two or more permit moves as one move. Multiple move permits, when granted by the traffic unit, shall be for a period of time not to exceed 30 days from the date of issuance. Multiple moves must be identified prior to obtaining a permit. 
(4)  Limited continuous use movements are movements generally to one site over a period of three months made by over-dimension (oversized) vehicles which do not exceed the weight limits defined in 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes, Act 5, Chapter 15. Limited continuous use permits may be issued for up to ten trips, generally to the same site during the time period allowed. Each move must be verified by the traffic unit prior to making the move due to possible lane closures requiring a route change. 
(Ord. No. 5082, § 2, 3-18-2008)  
Sec. 90-331. - Permits. 
(a)  A permit shall be required for the movement of any vehicle and/or non-divisible load (one which cannot be reasonably disassembled) or combination of vehicles on roadways and bridges within the jurisdiction of the Village of Glenview which exceeds the following limits: 
(1)  Maximum gross weight of more than 73,280 pounds. 
(2)  Maximum gross length of more than 60 feet. 
(3)  Maximum gross width of more than 8 feet, 6 inches. 
(4)  Maximum gross height of more than 13 feet, 6 inches. 
(5)  Maximum axle weight of more then 18,000 pounds. 
(6)  Maximum axle tandem weight of more then 32,000 pounds. 
However, access on Village streets within one mile of I-294 and I-94 within the Village limits is permitted, as required by the Illinois Vehicle Code, to those vehicles meeting maximum weights and dimensions and for those purposes, as the Village Code allows. With respect to those roadways and bridges under construction, road closures with or without signage do not exempt overweight and/or over-dimension movements from permit requirements when any traffic is allowed through construction zone(s) and when the movement is made by applicant(s) not performing construction on the roadway closed. In an emergency declared by resolution of the Village Board, the requirements to obtain permits may be waived. 
Exempt from permits are the following: 
(1)  Fire department vehicles. 
(2)  Those vehicles operating under an emergency declaration. 
(3)  Village owned vehicles engaged in emergency utility repair. 
(4)  Equipment used for snow and ice removal, owned or operated by any government body. 
(b)  Permits shall be issued only in the name of a person, firm, business or corporation that owns and operates the transporting vehicle or that operates the vehicle under a bona fide lease agreement. 
(c)  Permits for vehicles that are both overweight and over-dimensional are valid only a half hour before sunrise to a half hour after sunset, on any day which the permit is valid. 
(d)  Permits are non-transferable and apply only to the permittee. 
(e)  The Village may issue revisions to permits: 
(1)  To correct an error attributed to the Village. 
(2)  To correct an error attributed to the applicant, discovered before the move. 
(3)  To adjust weights, dimensions or routes as issued on the permit, before the move is made. 
(4)  Any revision made at the request of the permittee for purposes of changing weights, dimensions, routes or load descriptions shall be made before any move is made at a cost of $10.00 per permit. 
(f)  The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between the permittee and the Village that the move described in the application will take place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the Village's police department traffic unit any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the Village or the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms. 
(g)  The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of the authority granted by the permit for the use of Village roads, and any vehicle and/or load found to be off route will be considered off route and without a permit. Permits shall be in the driver's possession at all times unless otherwise directed by the traffic unit and presented upon demand to any and all police officers for the purpose of inspection. 
(h)  If required, arrangements shall be made by the permittee to have the proper utilities notified, property moved, bridges or highways analyses performed and completed in advance of any permit movement. 
(i)  All movements under the permit shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
(j)  Permits are void if altered for the purpose of deception. The permits issued under this section constitute the grant of a privilege by the Village and may be denied or suspended for such reasons as the Village may deem rationally related to its governmental interests including, but not limited to: 
(1)  A permittee knowingly providing incorrect information in an applicant for a permit.

(1)  The board shall not vary the regulations of this chapter, as authorized by subsection (d) of this section, unless it shall make a finding of fact, based upon the evidence as presented to it in each specific case, that the: 
a.  Particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a practical difficulty or hardship upon or for the owner, lessee or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulation were carried out. 
b.  Conditions upon which the petition for a variation is based are unique and would not be generally applicable to other property within the same zoning classification. 
c.  Alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property. 
d.  Granting of the variation will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
e.  Proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety. 
f.  Variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
(2)  If all of the standards set forth in subsection (c)(1) of this section cannot be met, yet an identifiable overriding public benefit can be realized by the granting of the requested variation, the zoning board of appeals shall forward a written recommendation, including a specific finding of fact of overriding public benefit, to the board of trustees for final disposition. 
(3)  The board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this subsection (c) to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the general intent of this chapter. 
(4)  For modifications to existing residential buildings on existing conforming lots upon which all bulk regulations of the applicable district have been met, the director of community development may allow, as an exception, a structure to encroach upon a front yard up to 12 inches, and upon a side or rear yard by up to six inches, without the necessity of a variation from the zoning board of appeals, provided proper notification has been given to adjacent property owners in accordance with subsection (b), and provided the standards for variations listed in subsection (c)(1) have been met. 
(d)  Commercial and industrial uses. The procedures provided for in this section with respect to the grant of variations to lots which are located within the B-1, B-2, B-3, D-D, H-1, MURC, SLE, I-1, or I-2 zoning district, or lots which are located in the R-1, R-1.3, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5 or P-1 district and are utilized for commercial or industrial uses shall not apply. In lieu thereof, the procedures contained within subsection 98-50(b) shall apply to applications for variations to commercial and industrial lots. 
(e)  Authorization. Variations from the regulations of this chapter shall be recommended by the board only in accordance with the standards set forth in subsection (c) of this section, and may be granted only to: 
(1)  Vary the applicable bulk regulations, including yard, lot size, height and density requirements.

(8)  Vary any of the regulations contained in section 98-382 pertaining to lighting. 
(f)  Vote necessary for variance. The concurring vote of four members of the zoning board of appeals shall be necessary to grant a variation. Variance approval granted by the zoning board of appeals shall be established in accordance with the period set forth in section 54-2, unless a longer period of time is expressly authorized by the zoning board of appeals or by further zoning board of appeals action, if the applicant demonstrates that there are circumstances, difficulties or practical hardships which make compliance with the original time period unreasonable. 
(g)  Preannexation agreements and planned development zoning. 
(1)  The procedures provided for in this section with respect to the granting of variations to a petition or petitioners for such variations, who or which have also entered into a preannexation agreement with the Village and a planned development zoning ordinance, shall not apply insofar as the granting of such variation by the zoning board of appeals as provided for in this section where the approved preannexation agreement and a planned development zoning ordinance specify the granting of such variation. 
(2)  The granting or denial of such a request for a zoning variation may, when requested, be made by corporate authorities when the petitioner therefore also has pending before such corporate authorities a request to annex its property to the Village in the form of a preannexation agreement or rezone its property to a planned development. 
(3)  The approval for such variation by the Village, if granted, shall be contained in the preannexation agreement, when it is entered into between the parties thereto and in the planned development zoning ordinance. 
(4)  Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the zoning board of appeals from granting or denying variations which are not specified in the preannexation agreement and the planned development zoning ordinance. 
(h)  Abandonment or discontinuance of a use benefited by variation. In any district, a lawfully approved variation benefiting a use that is abandoned or discontinued for a period exceeding three months shall no longer be valid unless substantial attempts to resume the use are undertaken within such three-month period. All subsequent uses of the property shall conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.

(g)  Application following denial. Any conditional use application which has been denied, either through action or no action of the board of trustees, may not be proposed again for a period of two years from the date of the board of trustees' action. 
(h)  Commencement, discontinuance and abandonment. 
(1)  A lawfully established conditional use shall be established within the time period set forth in section 54-2, unless a longer period of time is expressly authorized by the board of trustees or by further board of trustees action if the applicant demonstrates that there are circumstances, difficulties or practical hardships which make compliance with the original time period unreasonable. Failure to complete construction within the term of the building permit shall cause such conditional use to lapse, and, provided further, failure to comply with all applicable conditions established in connection with approval of such conditional use shall also cause such approval to lapse and be void.

Sec. 98-51. - Annexed land. 
All land which may be annexed to the Village shall be automatically classified in the R-1 residential district. If no application for reclassification of the property has been filed within 90 days, the plan commission shall on its own motion schedule a public hearing on the advisability of the zoning classification of the property. If, following such hearing, the commission believes the R-1 residential classification is improper, the commission shall transmit to the board of trustees a written report giving their findings and recommendations for proposed reclassification of the property; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to land affected by a valid annexation agreement adopted pursuant to article XI, division 15.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code.

(11)  B-1 limited business district (see section 98-131). A district designed to permit only those retail uses which are compatible with the residential uses existing in close proximity to such district. 
(12)  B-2 general business district (see section 98-132). A district designed to permit commercial uses of a type compatible with the existing commercial character of a major arterial highway, such as Waukegan Road. 
(13)  B-3 general service district (see section 98-133). A district designed primarily to supplement areas served by the central and general business district, with a variety of necessary services and goods incompatible with the uses permitted in the B-1 central business district and not allowed therein, and not normally compatible in the B-2 general business district and thereby permitted in that district only by conditional use and after a public hearing. 
(14)  H-1 hospital and medical district (see section 98-134). A district designed to permit the orderly development of an area which will provide the people of the Village with a hospital and ancillary medical treatment facilities and provide an area in which related activities can be located and operated with a minimum amount of inconvenience to surrounding areas. 
(15)  D-D downtown development district (see article XII, section 98-575). This Code focuses on the creation of mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods, and emphasizes building "form," "public realm," and high-quality site and building design. It is intended to set the foundation for a vital, attractive downtown by encouraging streets, blocks, and buildings that are pedestrian-oriented, have a mix of uses, contain architectural diversity, and offer additional opportunities to live, work, and shop in the Village. 
(16)  I-1 limited commercial district (see section 98-161). A district designed to permit limited types of administrative, research, public utility service and business organizations which do not detract from the predominantly residential character of the Village. 
(17)  I-2 light industrial district (see section 98-162). A district designed to permit industrial uses which meet the strict performance standards of this chapter. 
(18)  MURC mixed use retail center district (see section 98-136). 
a.  The MURC district is an important commercial center having a traditional town center character that promotes its unique geographic location and setting, adjacent amenities and transportation linkages. Such district will consist of smaller scale facilities (as compared to the S/L/E district) for sports, recreation, wellness, entertainment, retail and cultural activities, with a variety of supporting professional office and residential uses. Such district will have a pedestrian-oriented character, with buildings located near the front property line and with building fronts oriented to the street. Development within the MURC district will include uses that supplement ground-floor sports, leisure, retail, service and entertainment uses, with retail, office, residential and other program uses for the remaining floors. Parking may be shared, where possible. 
b.  Development shall focus on the provision of active ground-floor uses, day and evening activities, and allow safe and convenient pedestrian and vehicular circulation. Window display areas are strongly recommended at the ground level of all business establishments to maintain customer interest. To emphasize the pedestrian orientation of the district, drive-through uses have been prohibited. 
(19)  S/L/E sports/leisure/entertainment district (see section 98-137). The S/L/E district is intended as a location for the generally larger scale sports, recreation, wellness, entertainment and cultural activities, with ancillary office and retail services. Such facilities may have supporting retail only when accessory to another permitted use. Such district is envisioned to be predominantly vehicular, yet should include pedestrian and bicycle accommodations that promote circulation through and beyond the S/L/E district. Development may range from large, subregional uses to small scale uses programmed for day and evening activities and accommodating related visitors and traffic. Shared parking shall be encouraged where uses are complementary. 
(20)  P-1 public lands district (see section 98-98-181). A district designed to recognize existing or planned public/governmental use of land or the use of land to provide public utilities. Such district is also contemplated to provide, in the event of present or proposed use for other than such purposes, a reasonable means of reevaluating the proper zoning of these areas. 
(21)  PD planned development district (see section 98-491). A district designed to permit the most advantageous development, in the public interest, of large tracts of land in harmony with the comprehensive plan of the Village. 
(Code 1959, § 24.3.1; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003; Ord. No. 5351, § 21, 6-15-2010)  
Sec. 98-82. - Zoning map. 
(a)  The boundaries of the districts listed in section 98-81 are as indicated on the zoning map of the Village, a copy of which is on file in the office of the village clerk in the Village Hall and is identified on its face as a part of this chapter, and such zoning map, with all notations, references and other matters thereon, is as much a part of this chapter as if such notations, references and other matters were specifically set forth in this section. 
(b)  It is the intent of the board of trustees that the entire area of the Village, including all land and water areas, rivers, streets, alleys, railroads and other rights-of-way, be included in the districts established by this article. Any area not shown on the Village zoning map as being included in any district shall be deemed to be in the P-1 public lands district. 
(Code 1959, § 24.3.2; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-83. - Boundaries. 
If uncertainties exist with respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  The district boundaries are the centerlines of streets or alleys unless otherwise indicated, and where the designation of a boundary line on the zoning map coincides with the location of a street or alley, the centerline of such street or alley shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. 
(2)  Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets or alleys, but do coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. 
(3)  Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets, alleys or lot lines, the district boundaries shall be as indicated on the zoning map. 
(Code 1959, § 24.3.3; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-84. - Use table. 
A list of permitted, conditional, and accessory uses in the Glenview Municipal Code is set forth in the table in this section. Uses marked "P" are permitted uses. Uses marked "C" are conditional uses. Uses marked "A" are accessory uses. Blank cells within the table indicate that the use is not permitted within the District. 
This table shall supersede existing use definitions and existing alternate permitted and conditional use zoning classifications included within the chapter 98, article III and article XII.

ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMITIES[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Cross reference Buildings and building regulations, ch. 18. 
 
Sec. 98-251. - Purpose; classifications. 
(a)  This article establishes districts, each of which is an appropriate location only for the uses, buildings and other structures permitted therein by this article. Within such districts, however, there exist nonconformities that were lawful before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, but that could not be newly constructed under the terms of this chapter. Future amendments to this chapter may be expected to create additional nonconformities. 
(b)  Recognizing the legitimate interest of those who lawfully established such nonconformities, this article is intended to permit most of such nonconformities to continue indefinitely. However, the Village desires, pursuant to the authority granted in section 11-13-1 of the Illinois Municipal Code, to eventually eliminate the types of nonconformities which have the most serious adverse effect on the surrounding areas. It is also recognized and declared that nonconformities substantially and adversely affect the orderly development, maintenance, use and taxable value of other property in the district-property that is itself subject to the regulations of this article. Therefore, it is necessary and consistent with the establishment of districts to strictly regulate nonconformities and encourage that such nonconformities be brought into eventual compliance with the standards of this chapter. Accordingly, nonconformities are divided into the following four classes: 
(1)  Lots smaller than the minimum now required (see section 98-252); 
(2)  Residential buildings which meet the present use regulations, but not the present bulk regulations (see section 98-253); 
(3)  Nonresidential buildings which meet the present use regulations, but not the present bulk regulations (see section 98-254); and 
(4)  Buildings and uses which do not meet the present use regulations (see section 98-255). 
(c)  The failure of any existing use, building or structure to comply with any of the standards of this chapter, other than the use and bulk regulations of the district in which such use, building or structure is located, shall not cause such use, building or structure to become a nonconformity within the meaning of this article. 
(Code 1959, § 24.9.1; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-252. - Lots smaller than the minimum now required. 
(a)  Residential districts. 
(1)  In any residential district, notwithstanding regulations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling, or an addition thereto, which complies with the regulations of subsection (a)(2) of this section, may be erected on a lot consisting entirely of a tract of land that: 
a.  Has less than the prescribed minimum lot size or width, or both; 
b.  Is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning ordinance; and 
c.  Has continuously remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of land during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been prohibited by the applicable zoning ordinance. 
(2)  Construction permitted by subsection (a)(1) of this section shall comply with all regulations, except lot size and width, applicable to single-family dwellings in the district in which the lot in question is located; provided, however, that the following side yard requirements shall apply to lots with less than the required lot width in place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable, but shall in no case permit a required side yard of less than six feet: 
a.  The sum of the width of the two side yards on each lot shall not be less than the smaller of: 
1.  Twenty-four percent of the width of the lot; or 
2.  The minimum total for both side yards prescribed by the bulk regulations for such district. 
b.  No side yard width shall be less than ten percent of the width of the lot and in no case less than six feet. 
c.  The width of any side yard that adjoins a public street shall not in any event be less than ten feet. 
(b)  Districts other than residential districts. 
(1)  In any district other than a residential district, notwithstanding regulations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a building designed for any permitted use, other than a multiple-family dwelling, may be erected on a lot of the type as set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
(2)  Construction permitted by subsection (b)(1) of this section shall comply with all regulations, except lot size and width, applicable in the district in which the lot in question is located; provided, however, that the width of any side yard need not be greater than that derived by applying the following equation (width required = x): 
x / Actual lot width = Minimum side yard required by district regulations / Minimum lot width required by district regulations 
(Code 1959, § 24.9.2; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-253. - Nonconforming residential buildings used for a permitted use. 
In residential districts, a residential building which contains no nonconforming use, but which does not comply with the applicable bulk regulations, may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following regulations: 
(1)  Enlargement, maintenance, repair and structural alteration. Such building may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or structurally altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or structural alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such building, except when an existing nonconforming single-family building is nonconforming in setback only, by no more than ten percent of the required setback, the building and zoning director may, in his discretion, allow a second floor addition in accordance with the provisions of section 98-43(d), and in consideration of the criteria listed in section 98-47(c). 
(2)  Damage or destruction. If a nonconforming residential building is damaged or destroyed by any means, it may be reconstructed within the original gross foundation area. 
(3)  Moving. No nonconforming residential building shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire building shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved. 
(Code 1959, § 24.9.3; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-254. - Nonconforming nonresidential buildings used for permitted uses.

ARTICLE VIII. - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 98-371. - Purpose. 
The land in the Village and surrounding areas is predominantly devoted to residential use. People who reside in such area have chosen the location because of the suburban atmosphere, free from objectionable noises, smoke, odors, vibrations and other irritants that are frequently found in more urban locations. The performance standards contained in this article are designed to minimize operations which would disrupt the existing suburban atmosphere. 
(Code 1959, § 24.12A.1; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-372. - Applicability. 
All uses established after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall comply with the performance standards of this article. Any existing use which complies with the performance standards of this article on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall continue to so comply. If the operations of any lawful existing use do not comply with the performance standards of this article, such operations shall not be varied or changed in such a way as to increase the degree of such violation. The fact that the operations of a lawful existing use violate the performance standards of this article shall not of itself make such use subject to the requirements of article V relating to nonconformities.

Sec. 98-384. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  When a new or altered commercial or industrial use of an occupancy is proposed that may, in the opinion of the building and zoning director, involve a possible violation of the regulations of this article, the building and zoning director shall, as a condition precedent to issuing a permit for such use or occupancy, require the deposit in escrow of $500.00 for a period of one year from the date of the new or altered use or occupancy. If, during such one-year period, the building and zoning director believes there is a reasonable probability that the regulations of this article are being violated, he may employ a qualified technician to perform investigations, measurements and analyses to determine whether or not the regulations of this article are being violated and may pay the technician's reasonable fees out of the escrow deposit, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. If the reasonable fees of such technician exceed the amount of any available escrow deposit, and if a violation of this article is discovered, the fees may be recovered as a penalty in the same manner as, and in addition to, the penalties specified in section 98-8. Escrow deposits or remainders thereof shall be returned to the depositors at the expiration of the escrow period. 
(b)  Whenever, in the opinion of the building and zoning director, there is a reasonable probability that any use or occupancy violates the regulations of this article, he is hereby empowered to employ a qualified technician to perform investigations, measurements and analyses to determine whether or not the regulations of this article are being violated. If a violation is found to exist, the violator shall be liable for the reasonable fees of the technician employed to perform such investigations, measurements and analyses. When no escrow deposit is available, such fees may be recovered as a penalty in the same manner as, and in addition to, the penalties specified in section 98-8. 
(c)  If a complaint is received regarding an alleged violation of any of the regulations of this article, and the building and zoning director does not believe that there is a reasonable probability that such a violation actually exists, the building and zoning director may, as a condition precedent to further investigation, require that the complainant post an escrow deposit with the village collector in the amount of $200.00 to defray the cost of employing a qualified technician to perform such investigations, measurements and analyses as may be necessary to determine whether or not such violation exists. If the complaint is substantiated, the escrow deposit shall be refunded to the depositor, and the reasonable fees incurred in retaining the qualified technician shall be recovered in the manner provided in subsection (a) or (b) of this section. If the complaint proves unfounded, such fees shall be paid from the complainant's escrow deposit, any remainder of such deposit shall be refunded to the complainant. 
(d)  In addition to the procedures specified in this section, the regulations of this article may also be enforced in the same ways as other provisions of this chapter.

ARTICLE IX. - ENVIRONMENTALLY SIGNIFICANT AREAS 
 
Sec. 98-451. - Purpose. 
(a)  The board of trustees, upon finding that certain areas within the Village possess or encompass a sensitive biological balance, particular habitat, historical importance or scenic value, shall, by ordinance, designate such areas as environmentally significant areas and promulgate regulations to provide for the protective management of such areas. 
(b)  This article recognizes that, because environmentally significant areas may contain certain important soil types, topography, hydrological characteristics and biological communities, there should be definite and specific limitations on building construction, development and land utilization within environmentally significant areas, designed to protect the values of such resources. 
(c)  The major objective of designating areas as environmentally significant is to prevent damage to specific environmental features, prevent depletion or destruction of natural or cultural resources, prevent alteration of scenic views, prevent loss of or adverse effect on historic character and prevent reduction of educational value. Within an environmentally significant area, the board of trustees may designate an area as a primary area if it possesses specific environmental characteristics, features or habitats that require the highest degree of protection from adverse effects of incompatible development. 
(d)  This article establishes an environmental review committee (ERC) whose purpose is to protect environmentally significant areas and primary areas from the problems of erosion, adverse impacts to cultural resources, flooding, sedimentation, water pollution, exhaustion of aquifers, stripping of forest cover and despoliation of wetlands. 
(e)  The goal of the ERC shall be to guide development so as to make maximum use of the capabilities of the land, including preservation of open space and wildlife cover of locally endangered species of flora and fauna, and avoid all possible damage to the natural environment contained within the environmentally significant and primary areas. 
(Code 1959, § 24.12D.1; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-452. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

Buffer area means an area between different land areas that is usually transitional between the two and is integrally related to and protective of one or both of the different land uses. 
Contiguous means adjacent and parallel boundaries extending for a minimum of at least 100 feet. 
Dbh means diameter of breast height of a tree, measured four feet above the existing grade. 
Dripline means an imaginary vertical line that extends downward from the outermost tips of a tree's branches to the ground. 
Endangered species habitat means the habitat necessary to maintain the existence of specific flora or fauna that are listed on the State or federal lists of endangered or threatened species. 
Environmental plan (EP) means site development plans, graphic and narrative, that describe a proposed development, existing environmental features on a property, the potential adverse impacts of the development and the actions proposed to make the development environmentally compatible in accordance with sections 98-45498-457. 
Environmental review committee (ERC) means a committee of fiveseven individuals, appointed by the board of trustees, that is collectively knowledgeable in planning, biology, hydrology, water quality, soil science, engineering, economics and the applicable agency permit criteria. The ERC reviews all EPs for developments within the environmentally significant area, makes recommendations on feasible modifications to meet environmental criteria or regulations and reports its findings to the Village plan commission. 
Environmentally significant area (ESA) means a larger area encompassing an important natural or cultural resource (primary area) deemed significant by the Village. Such area is determined to be integrally related to the integrity and quality of a primary area through direct or indirect relationships (e.g., the Grove National Historic Site area, which is bounded by Milwaukee Avenue on the southwest, the Interstate 204 (tollway) on the west, Lake Avenue on the north, Glenbrook Estates and Glenview Woodland Subdivisions on the east, and the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad on the southeast). 
Hazardous material means any substance listed as a hazardous material by the State Environmental Protection Agency or State department of transportation, and includes "hazardous waste" as defined by 35 III. Admin. Code 721. 
Leq means the A-weighted energy mean of the noise level averaged over a 24-hour period. Such term can be considered as the continuous steady noise level that would have the same total A-weighted acoustic energy as the real fluctuating noise measured over the same period of time. 
Plant life means all photosynthetic plants, including fungi, such as mycorrhizal fungi algae, mosses, forbs and trees, that comprise a community of a particular ecosystem. 
Pond and lake mean a natural or artificial impoundment of water that retains water yearround. 
Primary area (PA) means an important natural or cultural resource that possesses and/or encompasses a sensitive biological balance, particular habitat, historical importance or scenic value (e.g., an area defined as a national historic landmark, an area containing rare and/or endangered plants or animals, or an area containing wetlands) that require careful protection from direct importance or scenic value or indirect impacts from contiguous areas (specifically for the Grove National Historic Site Area, such area includes the contiguous woodland that represents the remaining remnants of the historic Kennicotts' Grove). 
Wetland means lands characterized by the presence of water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a predominance of wetland vegetation or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction, that are commonly referred to as "ponds," "swamps," "marshes," "swales," "sloughs," and "wet meadows," and that should be construed in this definition to include drainageways. 
Wildlife means native nondomesticated mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. 
Woodland means a forested area with a gross woody species basal area of 20 square feet or more per half acre and containing some trees greater than six inches in diameter at breast height (specifically for the Grove, the contiguous woodland that defines the primary area includes those areas of connected woodland or savanna remnants containing species associated with oak savanna and those areas imminently restorable to oak savanna).

(Code 1959, § 24.12D.4(3)(6), (8)(10); Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-456. - Exceptions of the application of section 98-455. 
The provisions of section 98-455 shall not apply in the following instances: 
(1)  Nonresidential construction or alterations in an area which has been previously lawfully disturbed or covered by a surface other than the natural land cover native to the ESA. 
(2)  Nonresidential additions to existing structures which lie within the ESA as long as such additions do not extend beyond the existing outermost dimension of the buildings, and does not cover any previously undisturbed land. 
(3)  Single-family residences existing as of January 16, 1990, which are contiguous to, or located in an ESA or PA. Such residences shall be considered to be surrounded by a use envelope, the outer perimeter of which shall be defined as a line 25 feet from the outer walls of the principal structure, or the lot line, whichever is the lesser distance. Within such envelope, the following changes may be made without submission of any plans to the Village above and beyond what is normally required for issuance of a construction permit: 
a.  Room additions which do not increase the size of the principal structure to more than the bulk requirements of this section. 
b.  Demolition of existing structures, and reconstruction of a new structure, within the confines of the use envelope existing as of January 16, 1990. 
c.  Accessory uses as allowed in accordance with sections 98-213(a) and 98-213(b) only when within the specified building use envelope and additionally in compliance with the bulk regulations of section 98-214, or as provided in accordance with subsection (4). 
d.  No additions or expansions or cumulative additions or expansions may be constructed beyond the use envelope existing as of January 16, 1990. No construction, structure, or construction related to it may extend beyond the building use envelope as it was configured on January 16, 1990. 
(4)  Notwithstanding subsection (3), any permissible accessory building or structure, provided, such improvements are placed upon that portion of the lot which has been previously disturbed or covered by a surface other than the natural land cover native to the ESA or PA and the additional impervious area does not exceed five percent of the lot area, subject to section 98-101(b)(3). 
(Code 1959, § 24.12D.4(7); Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003; Ord. No. 4888, § 2, 7-18-2006; Ord. No. 6159, § 6, 5-1-2018)  
Sec. 98-457. - Environmental plan criteria and requirements for approval. 
(a)  Approval criteria. 
(1)  All EPs shall address all vegetation elements, wetlands, drainage, visual and other such environmental effects of proposed developments as they relate to the criteria and requirements, and be consistent with the intent of this article as set forth in section 98-451. The EP shall be in compliance with federal, State and local regulations as such regulations may relate to environmental impact. 
(2)  The major focus of the EP shall be first to avoid, second to minimize and third to mitigate any detrimental impacts to resource characteristics of the ESA and PA consistent with the intent of this article as set forth in section 98-451. 
(3)  Construction plans must comply with section 7 of the Illinois Endangered Species Protection Act, 520 ILCS 10/7, and sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. No adverse effect shall occur to any critical federal or State endangered species habitat. 
(4)  Construction design plans shall preserve the hydrological characteristics essential to the integrity of the PA. 
(5)  The natural functions of ESA wetlands or watercourses shall not be impaired. Specifically, the natural grade and soils of any wetland or watercourse and the flow or quality of surface water to and from any ESA wetland or watercourse at any time during the year shall not be significantly altered in such a way as to degrade rare habitat elements or cultural resources. If negative alterations occur, mitigation in the form of restoration of the wetland or watercourse function and value must be provided in writing and approved by the ERC. 
(6)  Direct or indirect impairment to PA wetland shall be avoided. Impact shall be determined by the ERC. Examples of impact that could occur include, but are not limited to, wetland fill, drainage blockage or significant alteration to drainage patterns or subbasin watersheds. If a proposed development site contains areas of past wetland fill or drainage blockage, whether within the ESA or PA, such conditions shall be removed and wetlands restored by the property owner in conjunction with site development. Use of bypass flow-through piping shall be avoided or minimized in preference to preserving natural drainage. Stormwater control features (e.g., wet detention ponds) shall be designed to optimize protection of wetland areas. 
(7)  Construction plans shall be designed to minimize the creation of impermeable surfaces by limiting pavements, roadways and building footprints to essential square footages and using permeable asphalt and pervious pavers, where practical. 
(8)  Appropriate transport, detention and infiltration structures shall be incorporated in a coordinated stormwater management system to minimize both off-site outflow and surcharging (backwater) into the PA while maximizing groundwater recharge. 
(9)  The important cultural heritage, wildlife, recreational and educational values of the PA shall be preserved by maintaining reproductive and regenerative capabilities of wildlife and associated habitats, protecting historical contexts, maintaining aesthetic visual characteristics, designing compatible adjacent building structures and providing visual buffers made up of trees and shrubs consistent with existing vegetation. Preservation of such values must satisfy requirements of the State comprehensive outdoor recreation plan, the State historic preservation office and the National Park Service. 
(10)  Site design plans shall maintain or enhance the aesthetic, visual screening, windbreak, dust suppression, air quality improvements, noise barrier characteristics and other qualities of woodlands. All site improvements and structures shall be located and designed in such a way as to retain the maximum amount of natural vegetation on the site, especially existing mature wooded areas. Any structural design within the ESA should be designed so that building footprint roads avoid removal of trees with a dbh of four inches or more. Certain species of trees determined by the ERC to be incompatible invasive trees in the ESA shall be exempt from protection (e.g., in the Grove National Historic Area, eastern cottonwoods, box elders and European buckthorns are not protected). 
(11)  Landscaping designs shall maximize the use of compatible native species of trees, flowers and grasses to blend with or enhance the natural mosaic (complex) of ESA communities. Tree plantings shall be situated as buffers to protect the PA from adverse views, drainage and lighting effects. The objective is to soften impacts to the adjacent PA ecosystems. A variety of species shall be planted in natural arrangements to enhance the aesthetic and ecological value of such plantings. 
(12)  All native tree species with a dbh of more than four inches shall be protected with barrier fencing enclosing an area that includes the dripline area of the tree. Unprotected tree species with a dbh of four inches or more shall be retained if they are determined to be important to the historical context of a cultural resource element or to general aesthetic value. The barrier fencing must be located at least five feet from the trunk of a tree at all points. The fencing shall be mandatory only during construction. No disturbance or mowing shall occur within the dripline of any protected tree subsequent to construction. 
(13)  Soil erosion shall be minimized through compliance with the soil erosion and sediment control regulations set forth in article IX. 
(14)  No bulk storage or release into air, land or water of hazardous material is permissible within the ESA. 
(15)  Developments within the ESA or PA shall be designed to minimize reflected or generated light leaving the property from any direction, including skyward, by using nonreflective building shell construction and careful orientation and shielding of lighting fixtures. The frequency and intensity of generated light impacts on the ecological or cultural resources of the PA shall also be minimized by limiting operation of lights to actual use periods and using low wattage or yellow bulbs, whenever practicable. 
(16)  At no point along the boundaries of the PA or further within the PA shall the noise (sound pressure) level exceed an hourly A-weighted decibel level of a 24-hour 62 leq. Such standard shall be applied for all times during the day and night. If it is found that such standard is not met, operational or shielding remedies shall be sought. If the exceedance will be created by the development under consideration, noise reduction shall be provided in design plans. 
(b)  Environmental plan requirement set A. The following set of requirements for EP preparation applies to regulated activities within or partially within the ESA: 
(1)  The EP must provide information on proposed development plans in a combination of graphic and narrative formats that address the following points: 
a.  Describe the general need and nature of the proposed action. 
b.  Describe the existing environmental features on the property. 
c.  Describe the potential impact of the action. 
d.  Describe all feasible alternatives and other proposed actions to avoid, minimize and mitigate any potential shortterm or longterm adverse impacts. 
(2)  The EP must include an assessment of the direct or indirect impacts of proposed developments on natural or cultural features of ESA or PA ecosystems and cultural context. 
(3)  The EP must present information describing proposed actions in sufficient detail and accuracy to allow a reasonable assessment of the changes to the property. Such information includes the proposed land use, the building footprint, existing and proposed contouring, a cut and fill profile, access street and driveway locations and type (gravel, asphalt, etc.), and existing and proposed drainage systems, including flow-through calculations and retention/detention pond design. 
(4)  Specifically, the EP shall provide the following: 
a.  A description of the nature of the proposed action, including the following: 
1.  Existing landscape and activity on the site. 
2.  Conceptual site plans shall provide height, number of stories and placement of proposed structures, including setback lines and accessory structures. A scaled building evaluation drawing must show the existing and proposed exterior dimensions as viewed from all properties which are located within the ESA and located within 500 feet of the proposed development, and from all public streets. 
3.  Total approximate floor area of the proposed buildings. 
4.  Statement of interest in the land, including conditions for the sale or purchase of the parcel, such as deed restrictions, reservation of land for other uses or other conditions that may have bearing on the total land development. 
5.  Map of the applicant's entire holding and interest in land contiguous to the proposed development. 
6.  Vicinity map of all property within 500 feet of the development, that shows streets, easements, zonings, PAs, drainage, wetlands and land uses.

2.  Specific plans shall be prepared for each site in the interest of minimizing adverse direct or indirect impacts to natural or cultural resources. 
3.  Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with compatible native species, characteristic of the existing or potential natural plant communities. The density/coverage of vegetation shall be such that it shall approximate the existing or potential natural condition (i.e., predisturbed condition) within ten years for wooded areas and within two years for herbaceous areas. Consideration shall also be given to additional vegetation screening to minimize visual impacts upon natural or cultural resources. 
4.  A replacement tree or a combination of trees shall be provided on-site to equal the original dbh for each tree that cannot be avoided and must be removed by construction. The minimum size of a replacement tree shall be three inches dbh. 
Wetland creation or restoration shall provide soil, vegetation and hydrology characteristics that effectively replace or enhance wetland functions and values on the development site, specifically as they improve or enhance wetland conditions within the PA. 
5.  A management plan for private stormwater retention must indicate measures to provide for the continued effective function of the system by establishing a schedule of ongoing monitoring and maintenance activities that may include cleaning of invert grates, sediment dredging, planting stabilizing vegetation or periodic burns of wet prairie basins. 
6.  Site specific lot configurations and setback buffers shall be designed to protect site hydrology, aesthetics and vegetation (maintenance or creation of vegetation/drainage corridors, minimization of fragmentation and minimization of habitat edge creation), for example, clustering development should be encouraged. 
7.  When development activity is proposed for any property within an ESA, consideration should be given to the correction of any past obstruction of drainage or wetland filling that may have occurred on the property. Such correction, including additional wetland creation and native species plantings, may serve as suitable mitigation of impacts caused by the development being proposed. 
(c)  Environmental plan requirement set B. The following set of conditions for EP preparation applies to regulated actions for parcels that are within, partially within or contiguous to a PA. The consideration of the avoidance, minimization and mitigation of any impacts to natural or cultural resources of the PA shall be given the highest level of assessment for developments within such areas: 
(1)  An identification of the boundaries of the PA and the acreage of the PA on the proposed site development is necessary. If the edges are delineated and there shall be no proposed activity in the PA, then the distance of the activity from the PA shall be noted on the development plans. The exact locations of the protective barriers between the activity and the PAs and around protected single trees shall be noted on plan drawings. 
(2)  Wires, signs or other items shall not be attached to any tree that is within the PA and any other protected species within the contiguous ESA. 
(3)  The type and scope of activities within the PA must be mapped and described. Efforts to minimize encroachment into the PA shall be described. 
(4)  Prior to any development, clearing, filling or other activity for which a permit is required, protective barriers, as approved by the Village, shall be erected around the perimeter of PAs designated for protection. Such protection shall remain until it is authorized to be removed by the Village.

ARTICLE X. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 
 
Sec. 98-491. - Purpose. 
The purpose of the planned development district is to facilitate a more creative and efficient use of land than would otherwise be possible under traditional zoning regulations. The planned development also provides for preservation of natural site qualities, such as vegetation, topography and other unique physical site characteristics, the creation of urban amenities, the creation of additional open space and generally the design and development of unique high quality projects. 
(a)  The planned development is intended to provide for projects with either a single type of land use or a variety of land uses developed as a unified project. 
(Code 1959, § 24.13.1; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-492. - General provisions. 
In approving such planned developments, the board of trustees may impose additional restrictions and conditions particularly applicable to such development and may vary the general provisions, regulations and standards of this article, and may modify or vary any or all of the district regulations which would otherwise be applicable. 
(Code 1959, § 24.13.2; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-493. - Approval procedure. 
(a)  The procedure for securing approval of a planned development shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Step 1. Concept approval (optional). 
a.  The purpose of the concept or preliminary plan submission is to allow for review approval of an overall concept plan for planned development zoning which is of a preliminary nature by the plan commission and board of trustees. The concept plan approval process is optional. 
b.  Submission of a concept plan shall consist of the appropriate planned development zoning application and requisite submissions, subdivision application, appearance commission application, applicable fees for each of such applications, a proposed site plan, preliminary subdivision plat, preliminary engineering plans, preliminary landscape and open space plans, traffic impact study, tax impact study, market feasibility study, preliminary architectural plans, preliminary soil and sedimentation control plan and calculation for school and park dedication or fees. Each submission shall be submitted at the level of detail as specified on the applications themselves and in the engineering and subdivision guide, the applicant's checklist and the application guidelines. 
c.  The submissions as set forth in subsection (a)(1)b. of this section will be reviewed for their completeness by Village staff prior to referral of the application for public hearing. 
d.  The plan commission shall hold a public hearing on the application in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 98-49 and with the applicable sections of the plan commission rules and procedures. 
e.  Following the public hearing process and deliberative review of the concept plan, the plan commission shall prepare a report and recommendation, which shall indicate approval, modification or denial of the plan to the board of trustees. 
f.  The board of trustees, after receipt of the plan commission recommendation, shall either approve, modify or deny the concept plan. The granting of concept plan approval by the board of trustees shall indicate a general acceptance of the proposed plan and the appropriateness of the zoning and land uses proposed. Concept plan approval should also be viewed as an indication to proceed with the final plan process. The concept plan procedure is not mandatory and the petitioner may select to directly proceed to final plan approval. 
(2)  Step 2. Final plan approval. 
a.  The purpose of final plan approval is to obtain final plan development zoning approval. Submission for the final plan shall consist of final plans, drawings and any additional supporting data requested for all of the component parts listed in the concept plan submittal requirements, such as the final site plan, final engineering plans, final subdivision plat, final landscape and open space plan, as well as any necessary refinements to supporting documents submitted during the concept plan stage. 
b.  The submissions required in subsection (a)(2)a. of this section will be reviewed for their completeness by the Village staff prior to referral to the plan commission for public hearing. 
c.  A notice of public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in accordance with section 98-49(c). Once the plan commission hearings are held, the case reviewed and a report and recommendation transmitted to the board of trustees, the board shall approve, modify or deny the final plan. 
d.  The granting of final plan approval shall constitute a final zoning approval by passage of an ordinance and map amendment. 
e.  The final site plan, together with all other supporting plan documents, shall be binding on the owner, developer, their successors, grantees and assigns, and shall limit and control the use of the property, the location of structures, driveways, parking areas, open space and landscaping, and other accessory uses, except as may be modified in accordance with the changes in the planned development procedure as established in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  No alteration or amendment shall be made in the construction, development or use of a planned development without a new application under the provisions of this article; provided, however, that minor alterations may be made, subject to written approval of the director of development. 
(Code 1959, § 24.13.3; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)

(Code 1959, § 24.13.4; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003; Ord. No. 4397, § 2, 5-21-2002; Ord. No. 5748, § 7, 12-10-2013)  
Sec. 98-495. - Mixed uses. 
(a)  The appropriateness of the land use mix within a planned development shall be determined by the board of trustees. Where a planned development is permitted by the board of trustees to contain a mixture of land uses, separate subdivided lots may be designated for each use, where possible. 
(b)  In a mixed use planned development, each individual use should be created primarily as a self-sustaining entity in terms of parking and open space allocations. 
(Code 1959, § 24.13.5; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003)  
Sec. 98-496. - Standards. 
(a)  Development. A planned development should be developed in accordance with the general purpose and intent of the Village comprehensive plan, this chapter and other adopted goals and policies of the Village. 
(b)  Ownership. 
(1)  The entire property to be occupied by a planned development shall be held in single ownership or unified control as defined by this article if there is a single use on a single lot. 
(2)  Separate structures, each on their own lot, may be separately subdivided and separately owned. 
(3)  Should a mixture of uses occur within a single structure, the ownership of such structure and the lot on which it is located shall remain with a single owner as defined by this article to ensure consistent and comprehensive property management. The entire planned development property, inclusive of all lots which may be separately owned, shall be managed by a single entity to ensure that common areas, such as landscaped open space, parking areas, driveways, retention detention areas, private streets, fire lanes and recreational facilities, are properly maintained. 
(4)  Any departure from the ownership and management provisions set forth in this subsection (b) shall require approval of the board of trustees. 
(5)  A statement of present and proposed ownership and management control shall be required. 
(c)  Compatibility. The planned development uses must be of a type and nature, and location so as not to create a detrimental impact or influence upon surrounding properties. Within a mixed use planned development, the uses, despite their differences, should be complementary to one another. 
(d)  Need. The planned development must be of a character, land use and type needed in the area. 
(e)  Density. 
(1)  The density of a planned development, either in terms of dwelling units and/or square footage, shall generally correspond to the requirements of the underlying zoning district. 
(2)  In the instance of a senior citizen housing facility, the number of dwelling units permitted is 55 units per acre. 
(3)  Where a planned development is permitted by the board of trustees to contain a hotel or motel, the density shall not exceed one room for each 500 square feet of the lot area devoted to the development. 
(f)  Changes in residency or tenancy for senior citizen housing facility. Where a planned development includes any structure designed and intended to be used as a senior citizen housing facility, adequate safeguards shall be provided to prevent any subsequent change in residency from the elderly to the nonelderly, or any change in tenancy from renter-occupied to owner-occupied, for a period of not less than 50 years. 
(g)  Height. There shall be a maximum height limit of 50 feet for structures other than single-family. For single-family residential structures, there shall be a maximum height limit of 35 feet. 
(h)  Yards. 
(1)  A yard at least 30 feet in depth shall be provided along the entire perimeter of the planned development for structures of 35 feet in height or less. 
(2)  A yard at least 50 feet in depth shall be provided along the entire perimeter of the planned development for structures over 35 feet in height. 
(3)  Reserved. 
(4)  If a mixture of structural heights occurs within a planned development, the most restrictive yard requirement shall be applied. 
(5)  The setback requirements of the underlying I-1 and 1-2 zoning districts shall apply to developments of a limited commercial (I-1) or light industrial (1-2) nature. 
(6)  Accessory uses, to the extent provided in article IV, shall not be permitted in any part of the perimeter yard, except signs, fences, walls and hedges. 
(i)  Parking. Adequate parking shall be provided for each planned development use as set forth in article VI. Shared parking may be permitted on a limited basis for multiuse and/or multistructure planned developments. The amount of such shared parking shall be appropriate to the mix of uses proposed and the adequacy of parking resources in the general vicinity, and shall minimize overlapping peak parking demand peculiar to the uses proposed. The justification for such shared parking must be provided by the applicant. A single structure, single use, planned development must provide the parking required in article VI. 
(j)  Public improvements on-site and off-site. 
(1)  The planned development site shall be provided with adequate storm drainage facilities, public water supply and sanitary sewer facilities on-site as well as off-site, if deemed necessary. 
(2)  The proposed planned development site shall be accessible from public roads that are adequate to serve the traffic demand imposed upon them by the proposed development. Improvements to the public road system, such as lane additions, pavement widening, signalization and dedication of rights-of-way to achieve such improvements, may be necessary to provide for improved traffic flow to and around the proposed site. Adequate ingress and egress shall be designed so as to minimize traffic congestion in the vicinity of the proposed site. 
(3)  The on-site roadways, public or private, and the driveways shall be adequate to serve the uses of the planned development and shall meet the minimum standards of all applicable ordinances of the Village. 
(k)  Public services and facilities. The proposed planned development shall not impose any undue burden upon the public services and facilities of the Village, such as fire, police and public works. 
(l)  Maximum lot coverage. The maximum lot coverage of the proposed planned development shall not exceed that which is permitted by the underlying zoning district, and such maximum lot coverage shall be established by the plan commission in its review of the proposal. 
(m)  Open space. 
(1)  Each proposed planned development shall provide an appropriate amount of the net site acreage as open space. Open space shall consist of land specifically intended to be used by the public, or those areas reserved for use by all property owners within the planned development. Areas which shall not be considered as open space include parking lots, parking islands, landscaped areas immediately adjacent to buildings (architectural landscaping), landscaping for parking areas and detention areas which are wet the majority of the time or have their perimeter fenced. 
(2)  In evaluating the adequacy of the open space proposed, consideration shall be given to the following criteria: 
a.  The location of proposed buildings and land uses on the site; 
b.  The character and proximity of the surrounding development; 
c.  The amount of open space provided on other developed parcels in the general vicinity; and 
d.  The extent to which such open space is landscaped or otherwise improved to benefit intended users. 
Such open space shall be an integral component of the overall site design. 
(3)  All common open space shall be conveyed either to an entity established for the purpose of benefiting the owners or residents of the planned development, the Village park district or the developer/owner, provided that, in all cases, legally binding guarantees, as approved by the board of trustees, verify that the common open space will be permanently preserved as open space and properly maintained. Adequate safeguards, including covenants, shall be provided to prevent the subsequent development of such open space and to prevent the future construction of buildings and structures on such open space. Adequate provision shall be made for the care and maintenance of such open space. 
(n)  Landscape plan. A landscape plan shall be provided for all common open space areas and noncommon open space site amenities, indicating plant materials, grading, berming and recreational facilities and equipment. A schedule of landscape maintenance and material replacement shall also be provided and approved by the Village appearance commission and Village Board. 
(o)  Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Where a planned development includes any structure designed and intended to be used as a CCRC, the following provisions shall be applicable, which provisions shall govern in the case of any inconsistency with other provisions of this Code: 
(1)  A minimum tract size of 15 acres shall be required. 
(2)  The maximum density shall not exceed 18 units per acre. The permitted number of dwelling units shall be based upon the sum of all residential units and assisted living units. Nursing care beds shall not be counted towards the total number of permitted dwelling units. 
(3)  No lot line of a CCRC may be closer than 2,640 feet to the lot line of another such facility. 
(4)  A yard setback shall be provided as follows: 
a.  Principal buildings and accessory buildings of two or more stories in height shall be set back no less than 100 feet from the lot line. 
b.  All other accessory structures shall be governed by the provisions of article IV. 
(5)  The minimum distance between any two separate buildings shall be 15 feet. 
(6)  The maximum percentage of the site which may be covered by buildings shall be 25 percent. 
(7)  The maximum percentage of the site which may be covered by a hard surface, including buildings, parking lot surfaces, walkways and other impervious surfaces, shall not exceed 50 percent. 
(8)  The height of any building, exclusive of roof-mounted building equipment, shall not exceed five stories or 50 feet, whichever is less. 
(9)  Principal and accessory uses shall be permitted as follows: 
a.  Principal uses. 
1.  Attached or detached single-family units. 
2.  Multiple-family dwelling units. 
3.  Nursing beds.

b.  Accessory uses. The following accessory uses, if provided, must be for the exclusive use of the provider, residents and their guests: 
1.  Common dining facilities. 
2.  Therapy facilities. 
3.  Auditoriums/multipurpose rooms. 
4.  Recreation facilities. 
5.  Administrative offices. 
6.  Services and retail shops. 
7.  On-site laundry and dry cleaning services. 
8.  Laundry and dry cleaning facilities. 
9.  Other ancillary facilities deemed appropriate by the board of trustees. 
(10)  The CCRC must provide a means by which the facilities are made available on a continuing preference basis to Village residents and a means by which the facilities are made available on a continuing basis at less cost to Village residents, subject, however, to applicable federal, State and local law. All written proposals for fulfillment of such requirement approved by the Village Board of trustees shall constitute compliance with this subsection. 
(11)  Any proposed CCRC shall be considered by the board of trustees prior to its approval using the following criteria in addition to the standards applicable to all planned developments: 
a.  Long-range aims and goals pertaining to the physical and social development of the Village as provided in the comprehensive plan. 
b.  Integration of the proposed land use with the existing development and land use adjacent to the site. 
c.  Conditions and availability of adjacent streets to efficiently and safely afford a movement of traffic generated by the proposed development.

e.  Amount, location and proposed use of the permanent open space achieved by the development. 
f.  Accessibility of the site to public transportation. 
g.  Proximity of commercial and institutional facilities, including medical facilities, for the use of residents. 
(p)  Open space developments. 
(1)  Statement of purpose. 
a.  The intent of this subsection (p) is to permit one-family residential development in certain selected and restricted areas that, through design innovation, will encourage creative development alternatives that will benefit the total community by preserving desirable open space, wetlands, woodlands and other natural assets, in conjunction with the development of clustered one-family attached and detached residential dwellings, and provide improved design alternatives other than conventional subdivision development for difficult sites. The proposed open space development must meet the letter and spirit of this chapter, and the use will be compatible with already existing uses in the area, not interfere with the orderly development of the area and not be detrimental to the area. 
b.  The purpose of an open space development is to provide a method of development for land that permits variation in lot sizes without an increase in the overall density (numbers of dwelling units per acre) of population or development. This allows developments of varying lot sizes so as to provide home buyers a choice of lot sizes according to their needs and preserves open space, tree cover, scenic vistas, natural drainageways and outstanding natural topography. Such measures prevent soil erosion by permitting development according to the nature of the terrain; provides larger open areas with greater utility for rest and recreation; and encourages the development of more attractive and economic site design. 
c.  Open space developments are permitted only as planned developments. In order to be eligible for consideration as an open space development, the subject property shall exhibit one or more of the following conditions: 
1.  The property is of such a depth and/or width so as to make traditional single-family subdivision platting difficult. 
2.  The parcel is shaped in such a way that it contains acute angles which would make a traditional development difficult to achieve. 
3.  The parcel contains a floodplain or poor soil conditions which results in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable. Soil test borings, floodplain maps or other documented evidence must be submitted to the plan commission in order to substantiate the parcel's qualification for open space development. 
4.  The parcel contains natural assets which could be preserved through the use of open space development. Such assets may include the natural stands of large trees, land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife, unusual topographic features or other natural assets which should be preserved. 
5.  The parcel contains natural land forms which are arranged so that the change of elevation within the site includes slopes in excess of ten percent between the elevations. The elevation changes and slopes shall appear as the typical feature of the site, rather than the exceptional or infrequent features of the site. The topography is such that achieving road grades of less than that permitted by the Village would be impossible unless the site were mass graded. 
6.  The site plan creates the additional open space required under this subsection (p) as a site amenity. 
7.  In addition to one or more of the conditions set forth in subsections (p)(1)c.1.6. of this section, the site shall contain at least one of the following characteristics: 
i.  The parcel has at least one lot line which abuts a nonsingle-family residential zoning district, a permanent nonresidential use or major thoroughfare; or 
ii.  The parcel is situated so that the open space development option will allow flexibility in design and placement of open space for increased insulation and protection for the residential units from an adjacent expressway or other major thoroughfare. 
Compliance with such standards shall not automatically guarantee approval of an open space development. 
(2)  Total project dwelling units per acre. The number of dwelling units per acre of the proposed open space development shall not exceed that permitted in the underlying zoning district. In calculating the dwelling units per acre of the proposed open space development, the total site area shall exclude public or private rights-of-way, paved parking lots and any school and/or park sites. In calculating the permissible numbers of dwelling units per acre in the underlying zoning district, the following shall be used: 
a.  R-E, one dwelling unit per two acres. 
b.  R-1, one dwelling unit per acre. 
c.  R-1.3, 1.33 dwelling units per acre. 
d.  R-2, two dwelling units per acre. 
e.  R-3, three dwelling units per acre. 
f.  R-4, four dwelling units per acre. 
g.  R-5, five dwelling units per acre. 
h.  RT-8, eight dwelling units per acre. 
i.  R-18, 18 dwelling units per acre. 
(3)  Minimum parcel size. No open space development shall be permitted unless the development contains a total site area of not less than five acres. 
(4)  Permitted uses. Single-family detached dwelling units, attached dwelling units (townhomes) and related accessory structures shall be permitted uses in open space developments. 
(5)  Bulk requirements. 
a.  The following bulk standards shall be applicable to open space developments, notwithstanding the bulk standards applicable to other types of planned developments: 
1.  Minimum lot area. No minimum lot area is required. 
2.  Minimum lot width. No minimum lot width is required. 
3.  Buildings per lot. No more than one building is permitted per lot. 
4.  Maximum building height. Maximum building height is 35 feet. 
5.  Minimum setbacks. 
i.  Front setbacks. Front setbacks shall be a minimum of 20 feet from the right-of-way. 
ii.  Interior side setbacks. 
Single-family detached dwellings shall be set back a minimum of ten feet between buildings. 
Single-family attached dwellings shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet between buildings. 
iii.  Interior side to rear setbacks. 
Single-family detached dwellings shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet between buildings. 
Single-family attached dwellings shall be set back a minimum of 30 feet between buildings. 
iv.  Exterior side setbacks (adjoining a street). Exterior side setbacks (adjoining a street) shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet to the right-of-way. 
v.  Interior rear setbacks. Interior rear setbacks shall be 40 feet between buildings. 
6.  Maximum site coverage. Maximum site coverage shall be 40 percent of the net area of the site. For purposes of this subsection, the term "net site area" shall mean the total site area exclusive of any site area devoted to public or private rights-of-way. However, at the discretion of the plan commission and/or Village Board, such percentage may be adjusted as deemed appropriate or desirable with respect to the proposed development. 
7.  Minimum site perimeter yard. A yard shall be provided around the perimeter of the site of no less depth or width than that required by the underlying zoning or the corresponding minimum yard required on the property adjacent to the site, whichever is greater. If the property abuts a right-of-way, the perimeter yard shall be that established on the approved site plan. 
b.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (p)(5)a. of this section, the plan commission and/or Village Board shall have the right to impose such requirements or adjust and/or increase any such requirements as set forth in this section. 
(6)  Minimum total parking. A minimum of two parking spaces shall be provided per unit, with additional parking spaces to be provided and located commensurate with anticipated need as established by Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) or other similar standards. 
(7)  Additional application requirements. In addition to the submission requirements applicable to other planned developments, any application for an open space development shall also include: 
a.  A statement setting forth the total area of the tract; 
b.  The available developable acreage; 
c.  The maximum number of lots allowable for the site by the underlying zoning under conventional zoning requirements; 
d.  The number and size of lots in the proposed open space development; and 
e.  The total area of the open space system. 
(8)  Additional approval standards. The following standards are applicable to open space developments and supplement the other planned development approval standards set forth in this section: 
a.  An open space development shall include substantially more open space than might be expected with more traditional development patterns. 
b.  Each dwelling unit shall be provided with an adequate private area adjacent to each such unit for the benefit of the resident. 
c.  Each dwelling unit within the development shall be provided with linkages and/or vistas or shall otherwise benefit from the open space areas proposed as part of the development. 
d.  Street and right-of-way widths within the development shall be designed and installed to the minimum width necessary to provide minimum emergency vehicle access, preserve the benefits of concentrating development on the site and foster a sense of immediacy and community. 
e.  Design techniques shall be incorporated into the design of the street system to reduce traffic volume and speed. 
f.  Through streets shall be minimized and the use of culs-de-sac and other design features shall be encouraged to reinforce the desired development pattern of small groupings of residences surrounded by open space. 
g.  Adequate alternative utility easements shall be provided elsewhere on the site in order to accommodate public utility needs appropriate to the minimal widths of public rights-of-way. 
h.  Sidewalks might not be required in an open space development if alternative pedestrian paths are provided that may include carriage walks to accommodate and encourage pedestrian circulation. In instances where no sidewalks are provided, linkages to circulation systems and public areas on adjacent properties shall be required. 
i.  The size of dwelling units within the open space development shall be consistent with needs of anticipated residents. 
j.  Common areas shall be protected from future development by conservancy or other easements that shall also assign ongoing maintenance obligations for such areas. 
k.  Common design guidelines shall be adopted to stipulate overall design themes that promote a diversity of building designs and a variety of building locations, while ensuring a harmonious and compatible development design. 
(q)  Form of ordinance. Any ordinance approving a planned development shall specify with particularity the special conditions and restrictions imposed by the board of trustees on the planned development, and shall specify the extent to which the district regulations which would otherwise have been applicable have been varied or modified, and shall provide for the land to be rezoned PD planned development, and shall be so shown on the zoning map of the Village.

Any person, organization or association may submit an application to the commission requesting that a building, place or area be designated as a landmark or be removed as a designated landmark. The commission may also initiate its own request for designation or removal from designation, any building, place, or area as a landmark by filing an application with the secretary of the commission. In the case of a historic district, applications must be accompanied by a petition signed by 51 percent of the owners of record in an area proposed as a historic district, unless such an application is initiated by the commission. 
(b)  Exemptions. Property owned by any unit of local government, school district or other governmental agency, in which the governmental agency or unit of local government has adopted a valid ordinance regulating the historic preservation of properties owned by such agency, shall be exempt from landmark designation as prescribed by this ordinance. Such exemption shall not apply to property owned by the Village. 
(c)  Notification and public preliminary review. 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for landmark or historic district designation, the secretary to the commission shall schedule a preliminary review to be held at the next regular meeting, or special meeting of the commission called for that purpose consistent with the time period specified in subsection (c)(2) of this section. The secretary shall arrange for written notification to the owner of record of the property, or the owners of record of an area nominated to be a historic district, of the time and place of the public preliminary review meeting and shall also cause the same notice to be delivered to the director of development advising the Director that an application for landmark or historic district designation has been received, requesting that the director report to the commission on any matters affecting the subject property or surrounding area. 
(2)  The public preliminary review meeting shall be scheduled to take place not later than five business days after notice is served by mail or delivery upon the applicant, and delivered to the director of development. 
(3)  At the public meeting noticed for the purpose of preliminary review, the commission shall consider the application and decide whether it merits a public hearing. The commission shall allow the applicant to provide reasons as to the merit or lack thereof regarding designation of the property as a landmark or a historic district. In determining whether there is merit in conducting a public hearing, the commission shall take into consideration the criteria established in section 98-536. In the event the commission finds that the application does not merit a public hearing, it shall enter a formal denial of the application. In the event the commission determines the application merits a public hearing, such hearing shall be scheduled in accordance with the procedures established in this article. 
(4)  No building permit shall be issued for alteration, construction, removal or demolition of a proposed landmark or of a property or structure within a proposed historic district from the date the secretary of the commission receives the application for landmark or historic district designation. After the public preliminary review meeting, in the event the commission denies the application for landmark or historic district designation, the freeze on issuance of building permits shall automatically be null and void. In the event a public hearing is scheduled, the freeze on the issuance of building permits shall remain in effect until the final disposition of the nomination by the Village Board of trustees, unless such alteration, removal or demolition of the proposed landmark or historic district properties, or structure, is authorized by the Village Board of trustees as may be necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare. 
(d)  Fee. Each application submitted to the Commission by an applicant who is not an owner of the property for which the application is being filed, nor is a member of the Commission recommending consideration of a property being nominated by the Commission, shall be accompanied with a nonrefundable fee as set forth in section 30-1. 
(e)  Waiver of fees. Application fees may be waived if the applicant verifies that he or she is unable to pay the application fee because he or she has insufficient income to pay these fees without substantial financial hardship. 
(f)  Notice and hearing: A public hearing shall be scheduled within 75 days of a receipt of the application for landmark and or historic district designation or removal from designation, and written notice, setting forth the date, time anyplace of the hearing, shall be given to the owners of record and any other person having a legal or equitable interest in the property subject to the application for landmark or historic designation. Further, the secretary shall cause notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the Village, setting forth the nature of the hearing and the common address of the property or properties which are the subject of the hearing, and the date, time, and place scheduled for the public hearing. At the public hearing, the commission shall afford the opportunity to any person attending the hearing to give testimony regarding the proposed designation or removal from designation. If the hearing is continued, the commission shall provide oral notice at the hearing and any subsequent hearings of such continuance or continuances until the matter is concluded at the commission level. 
(g)  Commission review and recommendation: The commission shall review all information presented to it pertinent to the request for designation or removal from designation and within 30 days of the last public hearing date considering the request, submit a written report and recommendation containing its findings to the Village Board. 
(h)  Action by Village Board: The Village Board shall take final action approving or denying the application within 60 days of the submission of the report and recommendation of the commission. An ordinance passed by the majority vote of the Village Board is required to approve landmark or historic district designation. 
(i)  Protection by designation: Upon designation by ordinance of the Village Board, such building, place or area shall be a landmark or historic district, afforded the protections provided by this article. A copy of this article designating the building, place, or area as a landmark or historic district shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owners of record of the property or properties which have been landmarked or which comprise a historic district, and recorded with the County recorder of deeds. 
(j)  Denial of an application by Village Board of trustees. The denial of an application by the board of trustees shall be deemed to have occurred one of three ways: 
(1)  A majority vote of the board of trustees adopting a commission report recommending a denial of an application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed denied; 
(2)  If the board of trustees fails to act within 60 days of the submission of the commission's report; or 
(3)  If a majority vote of the board of trustees recommends denial of an application which has been recommended for approval by the commission. 
(k)  Reapplication. Upon denial or expiration as provided in subsection (j) of this section, a new application for designation or removal from designation shall not be considered for a period of one year from the date of denial or expiration. 
(l)  Administrative review: Any final action taken by the board of trustees under this article shall be subject to review in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.

(Ord. No. 4382, § 9, 3-19-2002; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003; Ord. No. 4649, § 2(6), 6-1-2004)  
Sec. 98-537. - Certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  Required. A certificate of appropriateness issued by the Village Board shall be required before a building permit, moving, or demolition permit is issued for any designated historic landmark or any building structure or site or part thereof in a historic district. A certificate of appropriateness is required if the building, structure or site will be altered, extended or repaired in such a manner as to produce a change, in the exterior appearance of such building or structure. Such changes include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Changes by addition, alteration, maintenance, reconstruction, rehabilitation, demolition, renovation or repair which requires a building permit or a demolition permit; 
(2)  Moving a building; and 
(3)  Any construction or alteration, demolition or removal affecting a significant exterior architectural feature as specified in the ordinance designating the landmark or historic district. 
(b)  Exception. An exception to this requirement of a certificate of appropriateness may be made if the applicant provides evidence sufficient to convince the Board of Trustees that a failure to grant the building permit will cause an imminent threat to life, health, or property. 
(c)  Application. Every application for a demolition permit or a building permit including plans and specifications shall be forwarded by the Development Department to the Commission within 15 days following receipt of the application by the Development Department. The application for issuance of certification of appropriateness must include the following: 
(1)  Street address of the property involved; 
(2)  Legal description of the property involved; 
(3)  Brief description of the present improvements located on the property; 
(4)  Detailed description of the construction, alteration, demolition or use proposed together with any architectural drawing or sketches, if those services have been utilized by the applicant, and if not, a sufficient description of the construction, alteration, demolition and use to enable anyone to determine what the final appearance and use will be; 
(5)  Owner's name; 
(6)  Developer's name, if different than the owner; 
(7)  Architect's name; 
(8)  A filing fee of $100.00; and 
(9)  Any other information required by the Development Department or the Commission. 
(d)  Standards. In making a recommendation as to whether the Commission should make a recommendation to the Village Board to approve or deny an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall be guided by the following criteria: 
(1)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be utilized for a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building or property and its site environment. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials and/or alterations of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive stylist features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired or restored rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatment, such as sandblasting, that causes damage to historic material shall not be used. The surface cleaning of the structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved if such resources must be disturbed mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(11)  Contemporary design for alteration and addition to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alteration or addition does not destroy significant, historical, architectural, or cultural material and such design is compatible with the size scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(e)  Public hearing. A public hearing shall be scheduled on the application for a certificate of appropriateness and written notice, setting forth the date, time and place of the hearing, shall be given to the owner of record and any other person having a legal equitable interest in the property subject to the request. Further, the secretary shall cause notice to be published in the newspaper of general circulation in the Village, setting forth the nature of the hearing of the property involved, and the date, time and place of the scheduled hearing. At the public hearing, the Commission shall afford the opportunity to any person in attendance to present their views pertinent to the certificate of appropriateness. If the Commission must schedule any meeting for subsequent public hearing on the request, it shall so announce at the first meeting but need not give further published notice. Public hearings shall be initiated within 60 days of receipt of the application. 
(f)  Commission review and recommendation. The Commission shall review all information presented to it pertinent to the applicant for a certificate of appropriateness and shall present and submit to the Board of Trustees, within 30 days of the last public hearing date considering the applicant, a written report and recommendation containing its findings and recommendations. 
(g)  Action by Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall take final action approving or denying the application of a certificate of appropriateness within 60 days of the submission of the report and recommendation by the Commission. An ordinance passed by the majority vote of the Board of Trustees is required to approve a certificate of appropriateness. 
(h)  Denial of an application by Board of Trustees. The denial of an application by the Board of Trustees will occur in one of three ways: 
(1)  A majority vote of the Board of Trustees adopting a Commission report recommending a denial of an application shall be deemed a denial; 
(2)  If the Board of Trustees fails to act within 60 days of the submission of the Commission's report the application shall be deemed denied; or 
(3)  A majority vote of the Board of Trustees recommends denial of an application which has been recommended for approval by the Commission. 
(i)  Appeals. Appeals from the decision of the Board of Trustees shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Act, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq. 
(j)  Issuance and validity. A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued by the Development Department following approval by the Board of Trustees. A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if the plans upon which the Board of Trustees issued the certificate of appropriateness are modified without prior notice and approval of the Board of Trustees, or if the building permit issued for the same work becomes invalid. The certificate of appropriateness remains valid for the same one-year period of validity as the building permit. 
(Ord. No. 4382, § 10, 3-19-2002; Ord. No. 4512, 4-15-2003; Ord. No. 4649, § 2(7), 6-1-2004; Ord. No. 5762, § 6, 2-4-2014)

(a)  Purpose. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this article to the contrary, a certificate of economic hardship may be issued to allow the performance of work for which a certificate of appropriateness has been denied. A certificate of economic hardship shall be issued by the Board of Trustees upon a finding by it that all reasonable use of, or return from, a designated landmark or property within a historic district would be denied a property owner as a result of the disapproval of a certificate of appropriateness. The notice and hearing procedures required for the designation of a historic landmark shall be followed for the issuance of a certificate of economic hardship. 
(b)  Application. The following information must accompany an application for certificate of economic hardship: 
(1)  The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the party from whom it was purchased including a description of the relationship if any, between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased; 
(2)  The assessed value of the land and the improvements thereon according to the two most recent assessments; 
(3)  Real estate taxes for the previous two years; 
(4)  The remaining balance on the mortgage, if any, and annual debt service, if any, for the previous two years;

(9)  The form of ownership or operation of the property whether sole proprietorship, for profit or not for profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture or other; 
(10)  Any other information including the income tax bracket of the owner, applicant or principal investors in the property reasonably necessary for determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or yield a reasonable rate of return to the present or future owners. 
(c)  Public hearing. The Commission may solicit expert testimony or the applicant may submit evidence concerning any of the following items at the time of the public hearing, on the issuance of the certificate of economic hardship: 
(1)  Any substantial decrease in the fair market value of the property as a result of the denial of the certificate of appropriateness. 
(2)  Any substantial decrease in the pre-tax or after-tax return to owners of record or other investors in the property as a result of the denial of the certificate of appropriateness. 
(3)  Any additional cost of work necessary to comply with the standards and criteria for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.

(d)  Commission review and recommendation. Upon a finding by the Commission that without approval of the proposed work, all reasonable use of or return from designated landmark or property within a historic district will be denied a property owner, then the application shall be delayed for a period not to exceed 60 days. During this period of time, the Commission shall investigate plans and make recommendations to the Board of Trustees to allow for reasonable use of or return from the property or to otherwise preserve the subject property. Such plans and recommendations may include, but are not limited to, a relaxation of the provisions of this article, a reduction in real property taxes, financial assistance, building code modifications, and/or changes in zoning regulations. If, by the end of the 60-day period, the Commission has found that without approval of the proposed work the property cannot be put to reasonable use or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return therefrom, then the Commission shall recommend the issuance of a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work. A written report and recommendation containing its findings and recommendations shall be submitted to the Commission, which shall then make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees. 
(e)  Action by Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall take final action approving or denying the certificate of economic hardship within 60 days of the submission of the report and recommendation of the Commission. 
(f)  Denial of an application by the Board of Trustees. The denial of an application for a certificate of economic hardship will occur in one of three ways: 
(1)  A majority vote of the Board of Trustees adopting a Commission report recommending denial of an application for a certificate of economic hardship shall be deemed a denial; 
(2)  If the Board of Trustees fails to act within 60 days of the submission of the Commission report and recommendation, the application shall be deemed denied; or 
(3)  A majority vote of the Board of Trustees recommends denial of an application which has been recommended for approval by the Commission.

(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-572. - Applicability. 
The regulations of this code shall apply to all development, public or private, within the Downtown Development District, or "District," as designated on the attached Zoning Map, unless otherwise expressly exempted or provided in this Downtown Development Code (see areas shaded in gray in Figures 1.1, 2.5, and 3.2). 
The District generally encompasses Glenview Road from Washington Street to Waukegan Road, Waukegan Road from Lake Avenue to Henley Street, Railroad Avenue from Dewes Street to just north of Grove Street, Dewes Street from Washington to Waukegan, and portions of Pine, Grove, Church, Prairie, Harlem, McLean, and Maplewood that are side streets for the major roads in Downtown. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-573. - Effective date. 
This code was adopted and became effective on June 17, 2008, Ordinance Number 5112. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-574. - Purpose and authority. 
This code is adopted pursuant to the Home Rule powers of the Village of Glenview under the 1970 constitution of the State of Illinois. This code is adopted for the purpose of: 
1.4.1 Promoting the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
1.4.2 Improve the Village's quality of life for residents and visitors by enhancing Downtown's "sense of place." 
 
1.4.3 Implementing the policies and goals contained within the Village's Downtown Revitalization Plan; 
1.4.4 Maintaining orderly and compatible land-use and development patterns; 
1.4.5 Enhancing and expanding Downtown's retail environment by clustering shopping opportunities; 
1.4.6 Expanding residential opportunities, both to improve housing choice and increase foot traffic and vitality; 
1.4.7 Promoting rehabilitation and reuse of older buildings; 
1.4.8 Accommodating office uses in the right locations; 
1.4.9 Ensuring adequate light, air, privacy, and access to property; 
1.4.10 Providing for adequate storm water drainage; 
1.4.11 Enhancing pedestrian access and circulation; 
1.4.12 Providing efficient parking and transportation facilities; and 
1.4.13 Accommodating growth and development that complies with the preceding stated purposes. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-575. - Intent. 
1.5.1 The intent of this Downtown Development Code is to implement the Downtown Revitalization Plan adopted by the Village Board of Trustees on August 15, 2006. 
1.5.2 New development regulations are needed for the Downtown District, as herein defined, because the existing zoning, subdivision, site plan and appearance ordinances include provisions that are inconsistent with the principles of the Downtown Revitalization Plan. This code focuses on the creation of mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods, and emphasizes building "form," "public realm," and high-quality site and building design. It is intended to set the foundation for a vital, attractive Downtown by encouraging streets, blocks, and buildings that are pedestrian-oriented, have a mix of uses, contain architectural diversity, and offer additional opportunities to live, work, and shop in the Village. Downtown Plan implementation is intended to: 
1.5.2.1 Create a sense of place that has uses desired and needed by the community; 
1.5.2.2 Enhance the aesthetic appeal of the Downtown; 
1.5.2.3 Provide desirable amenities such as parking, open space and streetscape improvements; 
1.5.2.4 Address the needs of the Downtown merchants, while attracting additional high-quality establishments; 
1.5.2.5 Be financially prudent. 
1.5.3 More specific statements of intent are found within each major section of this Downtown Development Code. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-576. - Adopted plans. 
The following plans have been adopted by the Village Board of Trustees and shall be considered in any decisions under this Downtown Development Code in the Downtown Development District: 
1.6.1 Downtown Revitalization Plan (August 2006) 
1.6.2 Comprehensive Plan (2004) 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-577. - Minimum requirements. 
The provisions of this Downtown Development Code are the minimum requirements deemed necessary to carry out its stated purposes and intent. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-578. - Conflicting provisions. 
1.8.1 Conflicts with Local, State, or Federal Regulations: If the provisions of this Downtown Development Code are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government or inconsistent with other adopted ordinances or regulations of the Village, the more restrictive provision will control. However, in the event any of the provisions herein conflict with any of the provisions of the Municipal Code, the provisions of the Downtown Development Code shall apply. 
1.8.2 Conflict with Private Agreements and Covenants: This Downtown Development Code is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction or other agreement between private parties. If the provisions of this Code impose a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of this Code will control. If the provisions of a valid, enforceable private agreement impose a greater restriction than this Code, the provisions of the private agreement will control. The Village does not enforce or maintain a record of private agreements. 
1.8.3 D-1 Repealed: Section 98-135 of the Glenview Municipal Code, "D-1 Downtown Business District regulations" is hereby repealed in its entirety. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-579. - Severability. 
Should any section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this Downtown Development Code be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining words, phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or sections of this Code, since they would have been enacted by the President and Board of Trustees without the incorporation in this Code of any such invalid or unconstitutional word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, or section. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
DIVISION 2. - REGULATING FRAMEWORK 
 
Sec. 98-580. - Purpose. 
The Regulating Framework defines the desired physical form for Downtown Glenview and sets development parameters such as land use, street type, building height, siting and setbacks, and parking placement. The Development Code incorporates the Plan and also applies to, and regulates, parcels not referenced in the Plan. 
Figure 2.1 shows the potential buildout of opportunity sites identified during the Downtown planning process. It reflects the goals and objectives of the Plan and serves as a guide for Village officials, property owners, and development professionals as they conceive and implement improvement and development projects within Downtown. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-581. - Permitted uses. 
The following is a description of land uses allowed in the Downtown District (see Figure 2.5 for the location of each use by block.) Also refer to tables of permitted uses for each Street Frontage. 
 
2.2.12.2.5. Reserved. 
 
2.2.7 Below-Ground Uses: Ancillary commercial, ancillary residential, parking, storage, and mechanical uses are allowed in basement or below-grade floors. If commercial uses are permitted on the ground floor, such uses are also permitted in the basement level as long as access to commercial space is separate from access to upper-story residential units. 
2.2.8 Depths of Use: Depths of use requirements shown in Figure 2.5 are 50 feet minimum (see Figure 2.8). For example, at the southwest corner of Glenview and Church, at least 50 feet south along Church must be Full Ground Floor Retail before a transition to Ground Floor Retail/Office/Service/Residential is allowed. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008; Ord. No. 5441, §§ 2, 3, 4-7-2011; Ord. No. 5651, § 3, 3-19-2013)  
Sec. 98-582. - Minimum commercial depth. 
Commercial uses must have a minimum depth (from the front Building Line to the rear of the retail floor area) of 50 feet. For the three parcels (#003, 012, and 014) located on the southwest corner of Glenview and Waukegan Roads commercial uses must have a minimum retail depth of 30 feet. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-583. - Uses on same floor. 
2.4.1 While uses can be "mixed" within buildings by floor as noted above, residential and commercial (retail, service, or office) uses cannot be mixed on the same floor in a building (i.e. a floor with housing units cannot contain retail, office or service uses.) 
2.4.2 A residential lobby/elevator is required on the ground floor in all buildings with residential uses on upper floors. Commercial uses on the first floor may have a secondary entrance from this lobby as long as their primary commercial entrance is from the sidewalk on the street. 
2.4.3 Parking is allowed on the ground floor behind commercial uses in buildings with retail, service, or office uses on the ground floor. 
2.4.4 In addition to the use information noted above by location, See Article 3: Street Frontages for more specific regulations on allowed uses. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-584. - Building heights. 
Figure 2.9 depicts the maximum number of stories allowed in specific areas of the Downtown District. 
Tables 2.1 and 2.2 provide the maximum allowable height in stories and feet. 
2.5.1 Floor heights by story for multi-story commercial or mixed-use buildings: The ground floor shall be at least 15 and no more than 17 feet tall, with the upper residential or office floors being at least 10 and no more than 12 feet tall. 
2.5.2 Floor heights by story for multi-family residential buildings: All floors shall be at least 10 and no more than 12 feet tall. 
2.5.3 Floor heights for Waukegan Road north of Grove Street and 155' south of Lake Avenue right-of-way (up to existing corner lot) on the west side of Waukegan: For mixed-use buildings, the ground floor shall be 15 feet, with upper residential floors being at least 10 and no more than 11 feet tall.

2.5.4 Additional Height: 
2.5.4.1 Additional height: In addition to the maximum height for each building type, up to 5 feet can be added to the height of a building to allow for such features as pitched roofs, and parapet walls. 
This additional height is not allowed for buildings north of Grove Street and 155' south of Lake Avenue right-of-way (up to the existing corner lot) on the west side of Waukegan Road. 
2.5.4.2 Architectural features: For all buildings, an additional 10 feet (beyond the 5 feet allowed for pitched roofs and parapet walls) may be allowed by the Appearance Commission in specific circumstances to provide space for an interesting architectural feature such as a clock tower or a cupola. The floor area of these architectural features cannot be occupied for actual use (although they can remain open to provide additional ceiling height for the floor below). The floor area of the feature also shall not constitute more than 10% of the building's ground floor area. 
For buildings north of Grove Street and 155' south of Lake Avenue right-of-way (up to the existing corner lot) on the west side of Waukegan Road, this additional height for architectural features must be placed along the Waukegan Road frontage. 
2.5.5 One-story commercial buildings: For 1-story commercial buildings, the minimum height is 20 feet and the maximum height is 22 feet to provide an increased physical presence and shopping "streetwall." 
2.5.6 Decks/terraces: Active use is permitted on terraces created by building stepbacks. Decks or terraces are not permitted on rooftops or above enclosed ground floor parking. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-585. - Parking. 
Parking shall be provided for each use according to the following ratios: 
2.6.1 Minimum Parking by Use: 
2.6.1.1 Townhomes/rowhomes: 2 spaces per unit. 
2.6.1.2 Condominiums: 1.5 spaces per unit, with at least 1 space per unit indoors. 
2.6.1.3 Retail/service: 1 space per 300 gross square feet (except in the Glenview Road Corridor Frontage). 
2.6.1.4 Office: 1 space per 300 gross square feet (except in the Glenview Road Corridor Frontage). 
2.6.1.5 Restaurant: 1 space per 160 gross square feet (outdoor dining square footage, which includes outdoor dining located on upper story terraces, balconies, and rooftops, whether covered or uncovered) shall be included when calculating parking requirements). 
2.6.2 Exemptions from Minimum Parking by Use: For any new development project, the first 2,000 square feet of retail, office, or service use shall be exempt from the calculation for required parking spaces. The exemption shall be applied to the least generating use on the ground floor. Only one exemption shall be allowed per building. 
2.6.3 Minimum ParkingGlenview Road Street Frontage: 
2.6.3.1 Retail, office, and service uses in this frontage are required to provide 1 spaces per 500 gross square feet of floor area due to the availability of street parking and commuter parking along the tracks. 
2.6.3.2 Restaurants and residential uses shall provide parking according to the ratios listed in 2.6.1. 
2.6.3.3 In the Glenview Road Corridor Frontage, when a new use occupies a building existing as of May 21, 1996, additional off-street spaces are not required, provided that parking serving the building was not eliminated or reduced after May 21, 1996. 
2.6.4 Shared Parking: 
2.6.4.1 Collective provisions: Shared parking shall be considered to minimize the visual impact of land devoted to parking and to provide more efficient parking. 
2.6.4.2 Location: All required parking spaces shall be on the same lot as the building or use being served or within 350 feet of the property line (see Figure 2.10)provided that no off-street parking for a business use shall be in a residential district. 
2.6.4.3 Waiver: The Village Board may waive the number of spaces required in part or entirely if shared parking is deemed efficient based on the location of the proposed use, anticipated hours of peak parking demand, potential for shared parking, and availability of alternative parking. A written agreement covering such collective use shall be filed with the Development Department. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008; Ord. No. 5441, § 4, 4-7-2011)  
DIVISION 3. - STREET FRONTAGES 
 
Sec. 98-586. - Purpose and intent. 
Each Downtown street has been assigned a Street Frontage designation to define an optimal "building envelope" and "public realm" using setbacks, sidewalk and street widths, and other design parameters. 
Along with Article 4: Design Standards , the required street, sidewalk and building relationships are intended to foster new development that enhances and expands the traditional "Main Street" scale of Downtown. 
Figure 3.2: Street Frontages assigns designations to all street frontages in Downtown and establishes a Building Line for each frontage. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008))  
Sec. 98-587. - Building line. 
3.2.1 The Building Line is a "build-to" line that will help establish consistent "streetwalls," sidewalk widths, and streetscape zones (see Figures 3.1 and 3.2). 
3.2.2 Relationship of Building Line to right-of-way or property line: The Building Line may differ from the current location of a right-of-way or property line. In these cases, because the Building Line must be "built to," the right-of-way/property lines will need to be adjusted through dedication of property between the property owner and Village. More specifically, the property owner may need to dedicate property to the public right-of-way to create the desirable street and streetscape width, or the Village may transfer right-of-way to the buildable development site. 
 
3.2.2.1 For Glenview Road, the Building Line is intended to eventually bring all buildings more in line with an 18-foot sidewalk width east of the river and a common 15-foot sidewalk width west of the river. 
3.2.2.2 For Waukegan Road, the Building Line is intended to eventually eliminate parking lots in front of buildings and bring buildings closer to the sidewalk to better frame the street, reduce its perceived width and scale, and establish this roadway as a physical part of the traditional Downtown starting at Lake Avenue. The code also incorporates foundation landscaping in front of all-residential buildings and a landscaped median in the center of Waukegan Road to provide a "green," attractive entrance to the Downtown. 
3.2.2.3 For residential buildings along Waukegan Road, the Building Line provides room for a consistent sidewalk/streetscape space that will accommodate foundation landscaping in front of buildings. 
3.2.3 Where the Building Line designated in this Chapter differs from the Subdivision Code, Chapter 66, Sec 66-165, the provisions of the Downtown Development Code shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008))  
Sec. 98-588. - Street standards. 
3.3.1 Purpose and intent: The Street Standards defined for each Street Frontage delineate street and sidewalk conditions that will establish a more attractive, pedestrian-oriented shopping environment. 
3.3.1.1 Over time, desired or common sidewalk widths will be established to create a more regular walking experience from block to block that incorporates a minimum 5-foot "free zone" walking area and additional space for street trees, plantings in raised planters, or parkways. 
3.3.1.2 Developers are required to install Village-approved streetscape elements for new developments. 
3.3.2 Required: All developments within the Downtown District must comply with the Code's Street Standards. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-589. - Street frontages. 
The five designations are (See Figure 3.2 ): 
 
3.4.1 Where Street Frontage designations change along a street, either designation can be applied for a maximum of 75 feet in either direction along that frontage. Developments on corner lots should use standards for the building's primary street and standards for the "side street" frontage. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-590. - Glenview road corridor. 
3.5.1 Purpose and Intent. The Glenview Road Corridor is applied to Downtown Glenview's traditional shopping street. This stretch of Glenview Road has a pedestrian-oriented, "Main Street" character, and the Downtown Revitalization Plan and Development Code seek to enhance this character by providing a consistent building "streetwall," and a streetscape/sidewalk zone that allows ample room for walking, shopping, outdoor dining, and landscaping. 
3.5.2 Street/Sidewalk Standards. The Building Line for the Glenview Road Corridor Frontage, shown in Figures 3.3 and 3.4 , provides two distinct streetscape/sidewalk zones. 
3.5.2.1 West of the river, the Building Line creates an optimal 80-foot right-of-way to provide a uniform streetwall from the river to Washington, although some variation may occur to accommodate sight lines at the railroad tracks and at intersections. (See Figure 3.3 and 3.5 through 3.7. ) 
3.5.2.2 East of the river, the Building Line creates an optimal 110-foot right-of-way. This provides a larger streetscape/sidewalk zone because of the large street cross-section and acts as a transition between the Waukegan/Glenview intersection and the narrower cross-section west of the river. (See Figures 3.4 and 3.8 through 3.10. ) 
 
 
3.5.2.3 Glenview RoadWest of River. On Glenview Road west of the river, the desired sidewalk/streetscape zone is 15 feet. Within this space, required street trees can be placed in decorative tree grates to match the Village's standard grate or in 18-inch tall planters that help separate pedestrians and vehicular traffic, creating a sense of safety. (See Figures 3.6 and 3.7.) 
 
 
3.5.2.4 Glenview RoadEast of River. The desired sidewalk/streetscape zone on Glenview Road east of the river is 18 feet from curb to building, which would accommodate streetscaping such as street trees in tree grates or 18-inch raised planters while maintaining a sufficient clear zone for walking and shopping. A wider streetscape is desired because of Glenview Road's larger street width in this location. The 18-foot sidewalk will also act as a transition from the 18-foot streetscape/sidewalk zone desired on Waukegan Road. (See Figures 3.9 and 3.10.) 
 
3.5.3 Building Setbacks. 
A.  Front yard: Zero, build-to. At least 60% of the ground-floor front facade must be built to the Building Line, and it must be built to the Building Line at each interior side property line. 
B.  Side yard, interior: Zero, build-to at ground level. A 10-foot pedestrian pass-through is allowed if necessary to access a rear parking lot. 
C.  Side yard, interior adjacent to residential district (including Transitional Street Frontage): 20 feet minimum. 
D.  Side yard, corner lot on side street: Zero, build-to at ground level. 
E.  Rear yard: 5 feet minimum. 
3.5.4 Building Stepbacks. 
3.5.4.1 Front: Starting with the 4th floor, 10 feet from the Building Line, except for corner elements within 50 feet of the corner of the building. 
3.5.4.2 Side, interior: Starting with the 2nd floor, 10 feet from property line to allow air and light to windows. (See Figure 3.12.) 
3.5.4.3 Side, corner lot: Starting with the 4th floor, 10 feet. 
 
3.5.5 Parking Placement. 
The following standards are for off-street, surface parking lots. In addition, parking may be contained within buildings or underground. 
A.  Off-street, surface parking lots and parking decks must be placed behind a building. 
B.  5 feet from the side yard. If a side alley or access drive is present, parking is permitted within the 5-foot setback as long as the spaces are perpendicular to the alley. (Adjacent commercial parking lots must be connected.) 
C.  10 feet minimum from the rear of the lot if not adjacent to an alley. 
D.  5 feet minimum from the rear of the lot if adjacent to an alley. 
E.  5 feet from the Building Line on the side yard of a corner lot. 
3.5.5.1 Standards for Underground Parking. Underground parking must meet the building setbacks for the front and side yards at ground level specified in 3.5.3 and the parking placement standards for the rear yard specified in 3.5.5. 
3.5.6 Access. 
3.5.6.1 Mid-block curb cuts and access drives are not allowed in the Glenview Road Corridor. Loading, if provided, and parking access must be from the alley or side street. 
 
3.5.6.2 If no alley exists at the time of development, the developer is required to dedicate an alley right-of-way, construct the alley pursuant to Village requirements, maintain it by keeping it clear of stored materials and vehicles, and provide landscaping adjacent to the alley. Alley right-of-way width must be 20 feet with 5 feet remaining in the setback for foundation landscaping. 
3.5.7 Reserved. 
3.5.8 Conditional Uses. Any retail, office, or service use greater than 5,000 square feet shall require a conditional use permit. 
3.5.9 Building Types. Building types allowed in the Glenview Road Corridor shall be Retail/Office and Mixed-Use as defined in Article 4: Design Standards. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008; Ord. No. 5651, § 3, 3-19-2013) 
  
Sec. 98-591. - Waukegan road corridor. 
3.6.1 Purpose and Intent. The Waukegan Road Corridor is currently an auto-oriented roadway that provides an entrance into Downtown Glenview's main shopping area. South of Grove Street, this corridor is envisioned as an extension of the pedestrian-oriented shopping environment found on Glenview Road. North of Grove Street, this corridor should provide an attractive, mixed-use gateway into the Downtown retail core. 
The Development Code seeks to both accommodate auto traffic and enhance the pedestrian environment along Waukegan Road. Establishing a consistent "streetwall" with an ample sidewalk/streetscape is the main priority for this frontage. Following a common Building Line and prohibiting off-street parking in front of buildings will allow Waukegan Road to be "framed" over time with building "streetwalls": (See Figure 3.14 and 3.15. ) 
 
3.6.2 Street/Sidewalk Standards. The Building Line in the Waukegan Road Corridor Frontage provides a larger streetscape/sidewalk zone to compensate for the large street cross-section along Waukegan Road (see Figure 3.16). The optimal right-of-way is 110 feet, which will include a center landscaped median. (See Figures 3.16 through 3.19.) 
 
3.6.2.1 Waukegan Road. 
The desired sidewalk/streetscape zone for Waukegan Road is 18 feet from curb to building, which provides a larger pedestrian area to compensate for the larger street cross-section along Waukegan Road. 
In front of commercial or mixed-use buildings, the 18-foot width is intended to have a shopping streetscape character with trees in a landscaped parkway or planters, and a pedestrian clear zone of at least 5 feet. (See Figures 3.17 and 3.18.) 
In front of all-residential buildings, the 18-foot sidewalk/streetscape zone should include a parkway or raised planter, a minimum 5-foot sidewalk, and a 4-foot landscape edge at the foot of the building. (See Figure 3.19.) 
 
 
 
3.6.3 Building Setbacks. 
A.  Front yard: Zero, build-to. At least 60% of the ground-floor front facade must be built to the Building Line, and it must be built to the Building Line at each interior side property line (unless an access drive is to be built adjacent to the interior side property line). 
B.  Side yard, interior: Zero, build-to at ground level. A 10-foot pedestrian pass-through is allowed if necessary to access a rear parking lot. 
C.  Side yard, adjacent to an access drive within property: 10 feet minimum where there is no alley requirement, zero in all other locations. 
D.  Side yard, corner lot on the side street: Zero, build-to at ground level. 
E.  Rear yard, adjacent to an alley: 5 feet minimum. 
F.  Rear yard, not adjacent to an alley: 25 feet minimum. 
3.6.4 Building Stepbacks. 
3.6.4.1 Side, interior: Starting with the 2nd floor, 10 feet from property line to allow air and light to windows. (See Figure 3.21.) 
3.6.4.2 Side, corner lot: Starting with the 4th floor, 10 feet. 
3.6.4.3 Rear: Starting with the 4th floor, 10 feet (See Figure 3.25). 
 
3.6.5 Parking Placement. The following standards are for off-street, surface parking lots. In addition, parking may be contained within buildings or underground. 
3.6.5.1 All-residential buildings. 
A.  Off-street, surface parking must be placed in the rear 50% of the lot depth (from the front Building Line to the rear property line) except on the west side of Waukegan between the river and Dewes. 
B.  5 feet from the interior side yard (adjacent parking lots must be connected when sharing access drive). 
C.  10 feet minimum from the rear of the lot if not adjacent to an alley. 
D.  5 feet minimum from the rear of the lot if adjacent to an alley. 
E.  5 feet from the Building Line on the side yard of a corner lot. 
3.6.5.2 Retail/mixed-use buildings less than 30,000 sq. ft. on ground floor. 
A.  Off-street, surface parking is encouraged to be placed in the rear of the building, and at least 75% of the spaces must be placed in the rear 75% of the lot depth (from the front Building Line to the rear property line). 
B.  5 feet from the Building Line for the remaining 25% of spaces. The parking area may not occupy more than 50% of the frontage. 
C.  5 feet from the interior side yard (adjacent commercial parking lots must be connected). 
D.  5 feet minimum from the rear if adjacent to an alley. 
E.  10 feet minimum from rear if not adjacent to an alley, or if adjacent to properties along a Transition Street or other residential zone. 
F.  5 feet from the Building Line on side streets. 
3.6.5.3 Retail/mixed-use buildings greater than 30,000 sq. ft. on ground floor. 
A.  5 feet minimum from the front Building Line, although a portion of the off-street parking is encouraged to be placed to the side or rear of the building. 
B.  5 feet from an adjacent rear alley. 
C.  15 feet from the rear setback if no rear alley exists, or if adjacent to a residential zone. 
 
3.6.5.4 Standards for Parking Enclosures Sites without alleys are permitted to have a enclosed parking within the rear yard building setback. The parking enclosure must be setback 10' from the rear lot line and the structure cannot be more than 10' in height. Covered commercial parking is encouraged to be open and not enclosed with walls. 
3.6.5.5 Standards for Underground Parking Underground parking must meet the building setbacks for the front and side yards at ground level specified in 3.6.3 and the parking placement standards for the rear yard specified in 3.6.5. 
3.6.6 Access. 
3.6.6.1 Mid-block curb cuts and access drives are not allowed in the Waukegan Road Corridor north of Grove Street and south of Lake Street on the west side of Waukegan Road. Loading, if provided, and parking access must be from the alley or side street. 
If no alley exists at the time of development, the developer is required to dedicate an alley right-of-way, construct the alley pursuant to Village requirements, maintain it by keeping it clear of stored materials and vehicles, and provide landscaping adjacent to the alley. Alley right-of-way width must be 20 feet with 5 feet remaining in the setback for foundation landscaping. (See Figures 3.25 and 3.26 ) Access to alley from single-family lots on west side is prohibited. 
Any mid-block developer is required to build the alley up-front in anticipation of future links. The site plan must show how parking could be connected to the alley in the future and how a temporary Waukegan Road driveway would be disconnected and greened when the alley becomes active. 
Because the mid-block access drive is a temporary condition until a continuous rear alley is established, upper stories are permitted to be built to the side lot line over the access drive. 
3.6.6.2 Curb cuts and access drives are allowed on all other Waukegan Road blocks and shall be shared where feasible. Adjacent surface parking lots utilized by commercial uses must be connected. 
3.6.6.3 Curb cuts along Waukegan Road must be at least 100 feet from any intersection with a side street, such as Stevens, Maplewood, MacLean, Grove, and Glenview. 
3.6.6.4 Direct access to indoor parking, such as a parking deck or indoor parking within a residential or mixed-use development, is not allowed directly off of Waukegan Road. Access must be from a side street or access drive, alley, or parking area. 
3.6.6.5 Access drives must be shared with other mid-block developments on the same block. 
3.6.6.6 If a driveway is to be used to access commercial or residential rear parking lots on Waukegan Road, it must be shared with future developments on adjacent properties via easements if the future development cannot be accessed from an alley or side street. 
 
3.6.6.7 Access driveways to indoor parking as well as surface parking lots from side streets must be at least 25 feet from Waukegan Road. 
3.6.7 Reserved. 
3.6.8 Conditional Uses. 
Any retail, office, or service use greater than 5,000 square feet shall require a conditional use permit. 
3.6.9 Building Types. 
Building types allowed in the Waukegan Road Corridor shall be Retail/Office, Mixed-Use and Apartment/Condominium as defined in Article 4: Design Standards. 
 
3.6.10 Development Scenarios. 
The following 3-D massing diagrams show potential development scenarios on a sample block along the Waukegan Road Corridor. 
Figure 3.27 shows two infill developments that comply with the Downtown Development Code and fit in among existing buildings. 
Figure 3.28 shows how the block could develop over time with four buildings. 
In all cases, developments should feature high-quality architecture with appropriate articulation and fenestration as discussed in Article 4: Design Standards. 
 
(Ord. No. 5651, § 3, 3-19-2013)  
Sec. 98-592. - Secondary street. 
3.7.1 Purpose and Intent. 
Dewes Street, Railroad Avenue, and Harlem Avenue as well as side streets that intersect with Glenview and Waukegan Roads are considered Secondary Streets within Downtown. These streets are intended to have a mixed-use character that is supportive of the pedestrian-oriented shopping environment along the Glenview Road and Waukegan Road Corridors. The Secondary Street Frontage also seeks to provide appropriate transitions from the shopping blocks to adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
The Downtown Revitalization Plan and Development Code encourage a consistent "streetwall" of buildings and ample sidewalk/streetscape space. Limited curb cuts are allowed to provide shared access drives to new developments within a block. (See Figures 3.29 and 3.30, as well as figures throughout Article 3.7.) 
 
3.7.2 Street/Sidewalk Standards. The desired rights-of-way for the Secondary Street Frontage are shown in Figures 3.31 to 3.41 and described on the following pages: 
 
 
 
3.7.2.1 Secondary StreetDewes. Because properties on the north side of Dewes Street face residential uses on the opposite side of the street, additional landscaped setbacks are incorporated. A 10-foot landscape zone adjacent to buildings will add green space on the street opposite these existing residential uses. A sidewalk should be placed between this 10-foot landscape zone and a parkway or raised planter along the curb. (See Figures 3.31 through 3.33.) 
 
  
3.7.2.2 Secondary StreetHarlem. The intended streetscape along Harlem Avenue, with its retail and mixed-use blocks, is similar to Glenview Road but has an additional 2 feet in its streetscape/sidewalk zone. The streetscape should include trees in tree grates or raised planters. (See Figures 3.34 through 3.36.) 
3.7.2.3 Secondary StreetRailroad. Because of the head-in, 90-degree commuter parking and the potential need for outdoor seating/cafe space, an 18-foot streetscape/sidewalk zone is intended for the east side of Railroad Avenue. (See Figures 3.37 and 3.38. ) 
 
 
  
3.7.2.4 Secondary Street"Side Street." In addition to Dewes, Harlem, and Railroad, several other side streets act as a transition from the retail/mixed-use character of Glenview and Waukegan Roads to nearly residential blocks. A 20-foot streetscape/sidewalk zone has been established for these streets, with a 5-foot landscape space placed adjacent to the building. (See Figures 3.39 through 3.41.) 
3.7.3 Building Setbacks. 
A.  Front yard: Zero, build-to. At least 60% of the ground-floor front facade must be built to the Building Line, and it must be built to the Building Line at each interior side property line. 
B.  Side yard, interior: Zero, build-to at ground level. A 10-foot pedestrian pass-through is allowed if necessary to access a rear parking lot. 
C.  Side yard, adjacent to an access drive: 10 feet, build-to. 
D.  Side yard, interior adjacent to residential district (including Transitional Street Frontage): 20 feet minimum. 
E.  Side yard, corner lot on side street: Zero, build-to. 
F.  Rear yard, adjacent to an alley: 5 feet minimum. 
G.  Rear yard, not adjacent to an alley: 10 feet minimum. If a 10-foot rear stepback is included above the third floor, only a 10-foot minimum rear setback is required. 
3.7.4 Building Stepbacks. 
3.7.4.1 Front: Starting with the 4th floor, 10 feet from the Building Line. 
3.7.4.2 Side, interior: Starting with the 2nd floor, 10 feet from property line must be included to allow air and light to windows. (See Figure 3.43. ) 
3.7.4.3 Side, corner lot: Starting with the 4th floor, 10 feet. 
 
 
3.7.5 Parking Placement. The following standards are for off-street, surface parking lots. In addition, parking may be contained within buildings or underground. 
A.  Off-street, surface parking not contained within the building or underground must be placed in the rear 75% of the lot depth (from the front Building Line to the rear property line). 
B.  5 feet from the interior side yard (adjacent commercial parking lots must be connected). 
C.  5 feet from the rear if adjacent to a rear alley. 
D.  10 feet from the rear if not adjacent to an alley or if adjacent to properties along a Transition Street Frontage or adjacent to other residential districts. 
E.  5 feet from Building Line on the side yard of a corner lot. 
3.7.5.1 Standards for Underground Parking. Underground parking must meet the building setbacks for the front and side yards at ground level specified in 3.7.3 and the parking placement standards for the rear yard specified in 3.7.5. 
3.7.6 Access. 
3.7.6.1 Curb cuts are allowed on Secondary Street Frontages but must be spaced at least 85 feet apart. 
3.7.6.2 Curb cuts and access drives shall be shared where feasible, and adjacent commercial surface parking lots must be connected. 
3.7.6.3 Curb cuts must be at least 25 feet from any intersecting street. 
3.7.7 Reserved. 
3.7.8 Conditional Uses. 
Any retail, office, or service use greater than 5,000 square feet shall require a conditional use permit. 
3.7.9 Building Types. Building types allowed on the Secondary Street shall be Retail/Office, Mixed-Use, Condominium/Apartment as defined in Article 4: Design Standards. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008; Ord. No. 5651, § 3, 3-19-2013) 
  
Sec. 98-593. - Transition street. 
3.8.1 Purpose + Intent. The Transition Street Frontage provides a residential zone that fits the Downtown character of its location and provides a transition to residential neighborhoods to the south and west. 
3.8.2 Street/Sidewalk Standards. The Building Line in the Transition Street Corridor Frontage provides a larger sidewalk to allow for increased landscape and buffering across from established residential uses. The optimal right-of-way is 86 feet. 
 
 
3.8.3 Building Setbacks. 
A.  Front yard: Zero, build-to. At least 75% of the front facade shall be built to the Building Line. 
B.  Side yard, interior: 10 feet minimum from a lot line or access driveway. 
C.  Side yard, corner lot on side street: Zero, build-to. 
D.  Rear yard: 10 feet minimum. 
3.8.4 Parking Placement. Townhomes and rowhomes must have 2 indoor parking spaces per unit (within unit or in a garage). Minimum setbacks for any additional surface parking are: 
A.  25 feet from the front Building Line. 
B.  5 feet from the side street Building Line. 
C.  15 feet from an interior side yard lot line or access drive. 
D.  5 feet from the alley or rear lot line. 
3.8.4.1 Standards for Underground Parking. 
Underground parking must meet the building setbacks for the front and side yards at ground level specified in 3.8.3 and the parking placement standards for the rear yard specified in 3.8.4. 
3.8.5 Access. 
3.8.5.1 Curb cuts are allowed on Transition Street Frontages but must be spaced at least 85 feet apart. 
3.8.5.2 Curb cuts and access drives shall be shared where feasible. 
3.8.5.3 Curb cuts must be at least 25 feet from any intersecting street. 
3.8.5.4 Parking and services shall be accessed from an alley or garage. Rowhomes and townhomes are not allowed on a lot without an alley. 
3.8.5.5 Garages on corner lots shall face the alleys. 
3.8.6 Reserved. 
Table 3.4 lists the land-use categories allowed along the Transition Street Frontages. These categories are further defined in Article 6: Definitions. 
3.8.7 Building Types. 
Building types allowed on Transition Street shall be Townhomes and Rowhomes as defined in Article 4: Design Standards. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008; Ord. No. 5651, § 3, 3-19-2013) 
  
Sec. 98-594. - River corridor. 
3.9.1 Purpose and Intent. 
In addition to a green edge along the West Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River, the Downtown Revitalization Plan envisions a central open space framed by mixed-use buildings south of Glenview Road. The River Corridor Frontage requirements provide appropriate setbacks from the River to create an attractive, landscaped open space along its edge (see Figures 3.49 and 3.50). 
3.9.2 Requirements. 
3.9.2.1 Buildings and parking must be at least 35 feet from the edge of the river, which is measured from the established high water elevationsin most cases the channel bank. 
3.9.2.2 Property owners shall accommodate public access to the River through paths, plazas, gardens, or other forms of open space. 
3.9.2.3 Natural landscaping should be provided within the 35-foot setback. 
3.9.2.4 Developments at this location should comply with the standards for the street onto which they front and should also review the standards for the adjacent street frontage. 
3.9.2.5 If River Drive, south of Glenview Road, is vacated by the Village, buildings can be built to the River Corridor buffer, shown in Figure 3.49. However, developments should incorporate the central open space along the river envisioned in the Plan (see Figure 3.50). 
3.9.2.6 If River Drive remains, which is not the preferred scenario, buildings should be built to the existing property lines along the drive. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
DIVISION 4. - DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 98-595. - Purpose. 
The following Design Standards were created to complement the development regulations in the Downtown Development Code. The Standards should be used by landowners, businesses, developers, planners, architects, landscape architects, and engineers as guiding principles for developments proposed in Downtown Glenview. 
The Design Standards are intended to maintain and enhance the physical character of Downtown by encouraging development proposals that strive for high-quality design. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-596. - Village character. 
Although these standards do not mandate or endorse one particular style of architecture, they do recognize the value of Downtown Glenview's traditional historic revival architecture and its identity as an upscale, North Shore commuter railway village. 
The standards encourage development that respects the Village's history, "fits in" with high-quality adjacent structures and enhances Downtown's overall architectural character. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008) 
  
Sec. 98-597. - Objectives. 
Site and building design should enhance Downtown's electric character by: 
 Fostering a "built over time" appearance with variations in facades, building height, and rooflines. 
 Articulating buildings with detailed fenestration, high-quality materials, signage, and lighting. 
 Incorporating attractive, year-round streetscape/landscape elements. 
 Incorporating environmentally sensitive, sustainable design where feasible. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-598. - Context. 
The design of each development, whether it consists of one or multiple buildings, will be reviewed by Village boards and commissions for its suitability for a given site, compatibility with adjacent development, and consistency with the goal of improving the design quality of Glenview's built environment. In addition, other plans and development regulations affect development in Downtown Glenview. 
The Comprehensive Plan provides goals and objectives and a land-use direction for the entire Village. 
The Downtown Revitalization Plan sets a new direction for the improvement and development of the area. The Downtown Development Code and its Design Standards seek to implement the Revitalization Plan by providing development regulations and design direction. 
Developments are not required to use one architectural style but should enhance Downtown's existing character, which includes English Tudor Revival, English Cotswold, Georgian Revival, Federal Revival, Colonial Revival, Classical Revival and other traditional styles. 
 
The Glenview Municipal Code provides a variety of other related development regulations, as noted in the Introduction and Administration sections. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-599. - Organization. 
Standards within this section are numbered. Photograph captions also contain the number of the standard or standards that most closely relate to the photograph. 
Article 4.6 lists the standards specific to certain building types in the Downtown and includes "wireframe" diagrams that provide guidance regarding appropriate scale and massing. This section also provides photographs of buildings that feature high-quality design. 
Article 4.7 provides design standards applicable to all Downtown buildings on properties covered by the code. 
Article 4.8 through 4.10 provide standards for building materials, lighting, and outdoor cafes. 
Article 4.11 provides parking standards. 
Article 4.12 includes standards for Downtown streetscape and landscape. 
  
Sec. 98-600. - Building types. 
The following building types are allowed in Downtown: 
 Mixed Use 
 Retail/Office 
 Condominium/Apartment 
 Rowhome/Townhome 
Each building type must comply with the Regulating Framework and Street Frontages sections and follow the Design Standards in this section. 
The photos and graphics that follow show images for each building type. They provide additional direction for building siting, massing, and design. The 3-D "wireframe" diagrams are intended to show massing, scale, and fenestration but are not intended to show detailed architecture and articulation or indicate a preference for one architectural style for Downtown. 
Photographs included in these Design Standards are intended to show high-quality design and architecture but may not comply with every provision of the Downtown Development Code or Article 4. 
4.6.1 Mixed Use. 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
4.6.4 Rowhome/Townhome. 
 
 
4.6.4.1 The main entrance to each dwelling must face the street. 
4.6.4.2 Buildings on corner lots shall be designed with two front facades. 
4.6.4.3 Service, equipment, and trash areas must be located in and accessed from the alley where feasible. 
4.6.4.4 The design of garages, including materials, should be compatible with the design of the rowhomes/townhomes. 
 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-601. - Building design. 
4.7.1 General. 
4.7.1.1 To maintain an active pedestrian environment, buildings shall be oriented toward streets, sidewalks, and/or public plazas. 
4.7.1.2 Facades shall be proportioned to respect the human scale. 
4.7.1.3 Facade elements shall provide a change in plane, creating interest in light and shadow. 
4.7.1.4 Standardized, formulaic, non-regional architecture and architectural features used primarily for advertising purposes are not allowed. 
4.7.1.5 Developers should consider creative, adaptive reuse of high-quality existing buildings. 
4.7.2 Articulation. 
Plane/Material Changes: 
4.7.2.1 A building base, middle, and top shall be strongly articulated through materials, details, and changes in the plane of the wall, including stepbacks and patios on upper floors (see Figure 4.8). 
4.7.2.2 Pitched roofs may project into space where upper story floors have been step-backed. 
4.7.2.3 Mixed-use buildings must have a distinct ground-floor base with easily identifiable, traditional storefronts with clear glass and kneewalls. 
 
4.7.2.4 Facades shall be articulated to express vertical rhythm related to structural columns and bays. 
4.7.2.5 Building design should feature a balance of vertical and horizontal elements. 
4.7.2.6 Unarticulated, flat-front, all-glass, or all-metal buildings are prohibited. 
4.7.2.7 To prevent a "dead wall" on buildings with first-floor parking, articulate the ground floor with faux windows, banding, or other architectural features. 
 
Visual Interest 
4.7.2.8 Building orientation and design elements shall encourage overall visual continuity between developments. 
4.7.2.9 To avoid a look of monotony of materials or design, buildings should be articulated, such as with projections, recesses, material changes, parapets, cornices, and varying roof heights. 
4.7.2.10 Commercial and mixed-use buildings should have new facades at least every 75 feet. Long buildings should be "broken up" with articulation and contribute to a "built over time" appearance. 
4.7.2.11 Because of the prominence and visibility of corner buildings, features such as a cupola, rotunda, atrium, clock tower, pilasters, roofline balustrades, and/or varying rooflines should be considered to add visual interest to Downtown. 
 
 
4.7.3 Entries. 
4.7.3.1 Building entries should be clearly defined and articulated. 
4.7.3.2 Primary store entrances shall be located along the primary Street Frontage, with secondary entrances located behind the building or along a side street. 
4.7.3.3 Primary access to individual commercial storefronts, including restaurants, must be from the street/sidewalk and not from inside lobbies and hallways. 
4.7.3.4 On mixed-use commercial buildings, residential or office entrances/lobbies should be distinguished from storefronts and located on side streets and away from intersections wherever possible. 
4.7.3.5 Recessed entries for retail and service uses are encouraged to provide cover from the elements and to allow easier opening of doors. Non-recessed doors should not encroach into the 5-foot pedestrian clear zone when opened. 
 
4.7.4 Fenestration. 
Location 
4.7.4.1 Ground-level retail or office space shall include large, clear-glass windows that allow views into building interiors to reinforce an active shopping and business environment. 
4.7.4.2 Blank walls exceeding 20 feet in length are not allowed facing Glenview or Waukegan Roads. 
Amount 
4.7.4.3 At least 50% of ground-floor retail, service, and office facades facing Street Frontages or public plazas shall be fenestrated with clear, non-tinted windows. 
4.7.4.4 At least 25% of every upper-floor facade shall be fenestrated. 
4.7.4.5 At least 25% of ground-floor facades facing rear parking areas or alleys shall be fenestrated (see Figure 4.9). 
4.7.4.6 A kneewall of at least 10 inches and not more than 18 inches is required on commercial storefronts. 
Materials 
4.7.4.7 Fenestration must be either windows or doors that allow views into the shops, working areas, lobbies, or pedestrian entrances or window displays. 
4.7.4.8 Dark-tinted, spandrel, frosted, or smoked glass shall be used sparingly and for decorative or accent purposes or on solid walls necessary to the function of the building only (such as storage areas, kitches, and bathrooms). Reflective glass is prohibited. 
 
4.7.4.9 Solid walls necessary to the function of a building shall incorporate features such as awnings, display windows, material and color variations, arches, piers, columns, high-quality graphics, spandrel glass, landscaping, and other elements to reduce perceived building scale and add visual interest. 
 
4.7.5 Service Areas. 
Design & Materials 
4.7.5.1 Service areas, pipes, utility boxes, and utility doors should be placed out of view where feasible (see Figures 4.10 and 4.11). 
4.7.5.2 Accessory service areas behind buildings that are visible from streets and sidewalks shall be designed in a manner consistent with the building front or side. 
4.7.5.3 Loading, trash, and utility areas shall be designed to accommodate snow removal by eliminating unnecessary obstacles and providing storage locations where feasible. 
4.7.5.4 When parking is located behind buildings, rear building entrances and facades shall be designed in a manner consistent with the front and side facades. 
4.7.5.5 Access to rear parking lots should be clearly defined and visible from the street. 
4.7.5.6 Screening materials should complement the building and adjacent buildings in materials and color and be effective in every season, such as fencing, shrubs, or evergreens. Screening must be at least 7 feet in height. 
4.7.5.7 For all development that abuts a residential property at the rear, an 8 foot high solid screen fence is required along the property line. If alley condition is present, fence to be installed within alley right-of-way adjacent to residential property. Fence to be maintained by property owner. 
 
Location & Maintenance 
4.7.5.8 Separate areas for loading, trash, and utilities for individual businesses are discouraged. Shared service areas between businesses should be considered for ease of maintenance and improved aesthetics. 
4.7.5.9 Rear facades visible from streets and sidewalks should be treated with similar articulated architecture and fenestration as the front and sides of the building. Architecture and fenestration on the rear facade should extend at least 40 feet from the curb on a side street (see Figures 4.10 and 4.11). 
4.7.5.10 Loading, trash, and utility areas (including pipes, conduit, utility boxes, and utility doors) shall be located out of view wherever possible and in all cases screened from street and sidewalk views. Roof top mechanicals shall be located in the middle of the roof and shielded by a screening wall similar in design and materials to the building. These areas should be incorporated into site plans and building designs. 
 
4.7.6 Building Projections. 
Retail/Mixed Use/Multi-family 
Eaves and bay or box windows may encroach past the Building Line, with the following limits (see Figure 4.12). For regulations on blade signs and awnings, consult the Village's Zoning Ordinance. 
4.7.6.1 Eaves: 3 feet maximum 
4.7.6.2 Bay/Box windows: 5 feet maximum (allowed only on upper stories). 
Rowhomes/Townhomes 
Eaves, bay windows, and porches or stoops may encroach past the Building Line, with the following limits (see Figure 4.13):

4.7.7 Building Colors 
4.7.7.1 Building color shall be compatible with the area's character and enhance the building's visual appeal. 
 
4.7.7.2 Primary, bright, or excessively brilliant colors are discouraged unless used sparingly for subtle trim accents.  
Sec. 98-602. - Building materials. 
Overall 
4.8.1 Wood, brick, stone, and glass are the preferred primary building materials for all structures in the Downtown. New building construction and rehabilitations should be primarily constructed of these high-quality materials (see Table 4.1). 
4.8.2 Concrete block (smooth or decorative splitface), stucco (smooth or textured synthetic), plywood, sheet pressboard, unfinished pre-cast concrete, poured-in-place concrete, synthetic stone, smooth/textured synthetic stucco or plaster, and metal/decorative metal shall not be used as primary materials on facades or walls that are visible from streets, driveways, sidewalks, and/or parking areas. They shall be used only for decorative accent purposes and limited in their use on building facades and visible walls (see Table 4.1). 
4.8.3 The primary building material used on front facade shall be continued as the primary material on the side and rear facades, except where the side of a building directly abuts the side of an existing building. 
4.8.4 The number of materials on an exterior building face should be limited (no more than 5) to prevent clutter and visual overload. 
Fencing 
4.8.5 Brick, stone, or decorative metal shall be used for fencing. Decorative or non-screening fence height shall be 30 to 42 inches. Railings along terraces can be solid walls or open fencing but may not be clear glass or plastic.

4.9.1 Site lighting shall incorporate principles to limit "light pollution" and preserve the nighttime environment, such as incorporating down-lighting and shields. 
4.9.2 Lighting shall provide a sense of safety without having a negative affect on neighboring properties and shall be located, aimed, or shielded to minimize glare, sky glow, and stray light trespassing across property lines, especially along alleys. 
4.9.3 Exterior lighting for signage shall be down-directed. 
(Ord. No. 5112, Exh. A, 6-17-2008)  
Sec. 98-604. - Outdoor cafes. 
4.10.1 Outdoor cafes/seating areas are encouraged to make Downtown more active and enhance its overall pedestrian character, especially in blocks identified as key commercial/retail/restaurant locations. 
4.10.2 Outdoor cafes shall maintain at least 5 feet of clear space for movement of pedestrians along the sidewalk. 
4.10.3 Tables, chairs, and other equipment should be kept out of the pedestrian zone. The pedestrian zone also should be clear of street trees, tree grates, and other landscaping. 
4.10.4 Second-story terraces for outdoor dining are encouraged where sidewalk space is limited. Second-story terraces shall be integrated into the design of restaurants and the overall building. 
4.10.5 A temporary or seasonal barrier or edge is encouraged to define outdoor cafe spaces and ensure the pedestrian clear zone. The barrier should be a simple decorative railing, fence, planters, or similar element.

4.11.11 Bicycle parking shall be considered and placed in locations that are safe and convenient to high-traffic destinations in such a manner as to not impede pedestrian circulation. 
Sharing: 
4.11.12 Adjacent commercial parking lots must be connected, where feasible, if access to the two lots is not available via an alley, to facilitate trips between commercial uses.

Sec. 98-606. - Streetscape/landscape. 
An attractive and effective streetscape will provide visual continuity from block to block and continue to define Downtown as a special place. Developers should incorporate the Village's streetscape design into development, including standards for street trees, street furniture, pavers, and other streetscape elements. This will help visually unify the district. 
4.12.1 The current streetscape design installed along Glenview Road should be enhanced and continued throughout Downtown, with modifications to match different road and sidewalk widths. 
4.12.2 Landscape and hardscape for large corner bump-outs should be treated on an individual basis because of particular needs and situations in each area. Individual elements should follow the overall Downtown streetscape design theme. 
4.12.3 The developer is responsible for installing Village-approved streetscape elements within all new developments. 
4.12.4 Developments are encouraged, where feasible, to include "greening" elements such as planter boxes, gardens on terraces or patios, landscaping, and other environmentally attractive and beneficial features. 
Plazas and Open Spaces 
4.12.5 Plazas and open spaces shall be considered within new developments where feasible. 
4.12.6 Decorative paving such as brick, clay pavers, stone, decorative pre-cast concrete pavers, or stamped concrete shall be considered when designing the hardscape for new plazas, open spaces, and bumpouts. 
4.12.7 Existing and future open spaces should incorporate special features such as fountains, artwork, plantings, and other elements. 
4.12.8 Where pedestrian paths or pass-throughs are used to access parking, they shall incorporate decorative fencing, arches, lighting, paving or signage. 
Street Furniture 
4.12.9 Decorative metal benches, trash receptacles, and bike racks shall be provided at high-activity pedestrian areas. 
4.12.10 Decorative stands or corrals for newspaper vending machines shall be considered to consolidate clutter and screen views. 
4.12.11 Decorative planters shall be placed in plazas and along pedestrian paths and sidewalks where they will not impede safe flow of pedestrians.
