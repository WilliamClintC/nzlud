   AUDIBLE OR VISUAL ANNUNCIATOR. An annunciator which gives alarm by
means of a bell, siren, buzzer, flashing light or similar sound- or
light-producing device when activated, which is mounted at some location
which is clearly visible when observed or clearly audible at a distance of 50
feet or more outside of any building in which it is mounted. ANNUNCIATORS can
communicate directly with the Fire Department or indirectly through the use
of an alarm monitoring service or remote monitoring point.



   FALSE ALARM. An occasion that has resulted in a response by the Fire
Department to the activation of any alarm system because of malfunction,
mechanical or electrical defect, improper installation or improper operation

requiring an immediate or emergency response by Fire Department personnel.
The term FALSE ALARM does not include an alarm system activated as a result
of: any malfunction of equipment owned or operated by the telephone company
or resulting from the authorized servicing, testing, maintenance,
adjustments, alterations or installations of such alarm system; a power
outage; or utility construction; provided that, the respective permittee or
authorized agent thereof notified the Chief of the Fire Department prior to
commencement of any of such activities. The term FALSE ALARM does not include
an alarm signal caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary
circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. The term
FALSE ALARM does not include activation of an alarm system caused by an
unauthorized activation in a public building of an alarm required by law to
be located in an area open to the public or students of an educational

laws and regulations. The burden of proving that such alarm was not a FALSE
ALARM shall be on the alarm user.

§ 33.022  FALSE ALARMS.



   (A)   Each alarm having its alarm terminate at the police station,
either silent, telephonic or having an outside audible (local) alarm on the
premises within the meaning of this chapter will be allowed no more than two
false alarms in any calendar year. For every false alarm over two during the
calendar year, the responsible party shall be billed a service fee at a rate
established by the City Council by resolution. Such billing shall be made
monthly by the city. An authorized test of the alarm system shall not be
considered a false alarm, providing notice of such test has been relayed to
the Police Department and approved by the Police Department prior to such
testing. The service fee shall be assessed against the occupant of the
address protected by the alarm. The Police Chief shall have discretion to
waive the service fee for good cause.



   (B)   It shall be unlawful to intentionally cause a false alarm. If
any alarm business, alarm agent or owner, operator, proprietor or employee of
a premises where an alarm system is installed causes a false alarm
intentionally, the Police Chief may revoke or suspend the privilege of the
alarm connection to the Police Department.



   (C)   The Police Chief shall have authority to determine if an
excessive number of false alarms are resulting from the operation of any
alarm system. When such a determination is made, the Police Chief shall
inform the subscriber or the proprietor, owner or operator of the alarm
system that an excessive number of false alarms have occurred. If, in the
opinion of the Police Chief, excessive numbers of false alarms continue to
occur, the Chief shall have the authority to suspend or revoke the service
provided. It shall be unlawful to intentionally cause a false alarm
punishable as provided in § 33.999 of this chapter and, if a false alarm is
caused intentionally by any alarm business, alarm agent or the owner,
operator, proprietor or employee of a premises where an alarm system is
installed, the Police Chief may revoke or suspend the service at once.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit testing of a system
with notice given to the Police Chief.

§ 33.023  SERVICE AVAILABILITY FOR SYSTEM MALFUNCTION.



   Under this chapter, each alarm is the property and responsibility of
the owner, not the city. If a system malfunction occurs, it shall be the
owner’s responsibility to either disable or repair the alarm system within
a reasonable time period. Failure to comply may result in assessment of a
service fee determined by Council, plus the cost the city may incur to
disable the alarm.

§ 33.024  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALARM RESPONSE.



   Under this chapter, every responsible party having control or ownership
of an alarm system, audible or silent, shall, upon notification that the
alarm system is giving or has given a signal, proceed immediately to that
premises and render all necessary service; provided, however, that, the owner
or person in control of the premises may enter into an agreement with an
alarm business, licensed private detective agency or watch service to assume
the duty to respond instead. The responsible party or agent shall, upon
installation or activation of the alarm system, notify the Police Department
in writing as to the alarm type, address and planned response. Failure to
respond to an alarm or to notify the Police Department of the installation
activation or change in an alarm may cause the Police Chief to assess a
service fee of $25 for each failure or for any changes in the alarm system to
which the Police Department is not notified.

   I.A.C. § 372.13(5) provides that the City Council shall determine its
own rules of procedure. The following chapter shall be in effect upon
adoption by the Council until such time as they are amended or new rules
adopted.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.02  INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE.



   The City Attorney shall act as parliamentarian and rule on any
questions regarding the application or interpretation of this chapter. In the
absence of the City Attorney, the City Administrator shall be considered the
final authority on the rules of procedure for the conduct of City Council
business. Any good faith, non-intentional error in the application of these
rules shall not void any public action taken if, notwithstanding the good
faith, non-intentional error, the action taken otherwise complied with the
code of ordinances and the Iowa Code.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.03  RULE ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   The presiding officer, whether it be the Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem
or Acting Mayor Pro Tem, shall enforce this chapter. Any Council member who
believes the presiding officer is failing to enforce this chapter may call
attention to it by making a point of order referencing the rule or procedure
the Council member believes is applicable. The raising of a point of order
has the effect of requiring the presiding officer to make a ruling on the
question involved and, if appropriate, to enforce the applicable rule.



   (B)   Unless otherwise specified by law or this chapter, all
business will be conducted by majority rule of those present and voting.



   (C)   Following any adverse ruling on a point of order, any Council
member may move to appeal the decision of the presiding officer and, in so
doing, state the appropriate action which the Council member believes should
have been taken. If this motion receives the required second, the City
Council may, by majority vote, adopt the alternative ruling stated in the
motion.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.04  SUSPENSION AND AMENDMENT OF THESE RULES.



   A motion to suspend this chapter is debatable but requires a two-thirds
vote to pass. This motion allows the City Council to suspend its own rules
temporarily in order to accomplish a particular purpose.



   (A)   Temporary suspension.  This chapter may be temporarily
suspended by the unanimous consent of all the Council members present, or by
a vote of two-thirds of all the Council members. The vote on any such
suspension shall be taken by “yeses” and “nos” and entered upon the
record.



   (B)   Amendment of these rules.  This chapter may be amended or new
rules adopted, by majority vote of all Council members and shall, at a
minimum, be reviewed every two years.



   (C)   Supplemental rules.  The current edition of Robert’s Rules
of Order is adopted to supplement this chapter, where not in conflict with
this chapter. However, any good faith, non-intentional error in the
application of Robert’s Rules of Order shall not void any public action
taken if, notwithstanding the good faith, non-intentional error, the action
taken otherwise complied with the code of ordinances and the Iowa Code.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.05  CITY GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE.



   (A)   Mayor.  The Mayor is the chief executive officer of the city
and carries out the responsibilities specified in the code of ordinances.
When present, the Mayor is the presiding officer at meetings of the City
Council. The Mayor has veto powers authorized by the Iowa Code. The Mayor
appoints all board and commission members as provided for in this chapter.
The roles of these committees are detailed in the Board and Commission
Manual, which is consistent with I.A.C. § 372.14.



   (B)   Mayor Pro Tem.  The Mayor Pro Tem is vice president of the
City Council. When the Mayor is absent or unable to act, the Mayor Pro Tem
shall perform the Mayor’s duties. The Mayor Pro Tem retains all of the
powers of a Council member while performing the duties of the Mayor.



   (C)   City Council.



      (1)   The City Council is the legislative body elected by the
citizens of the city to make laws and policies for the community. The Council
approves the budget and determines the tax rate, among other required duties
set forth in the Iowa Code and code of ordinances. The Council is responsible
for major issues, such as community growth, land use development, capital
improvement plans, capital financing and strategic planning. The Council
appoints the City Administrator, who is tasked under the code of ordinances
with the supervision of the city staff and with carrying out most day-to-day
functions of the city government when the Council is not in session. The
Council supervises and evaluates the City Administrator’s performance.



      (2)   The role of a City Council member is similar to being a
member of the board of directors of a large business. The City Council
provides a focal point, or the conscience of the community. It is not the job
of Council members to become directly involved in the daily operations of the
city. The City Administrator and the department directors are responsible for
overseeing the implementation of services. The Council sets the level of
services and the policies by which the city operates.



   (D)   City Administrator.  The City Council shall select a City
Administrator, who serves as the Chief Administrative Officer, and shall
evaluate his or her performance on a routine basis. The City Administrator
shall work with, coordinate and supervise the department directors who have
the knowledge, ability and expertise to manage their departments, including
day-to-day operations, personnel supervision and assignment, expenditures
within the limitations of the city budget, the administration of laws, rules
and regulations applicable to their departments, and staffing. Except for the
purposes of fact-finding, City Council members shall deal with the
administrative agencies of the city through the City Administrator.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.06  MAYOR’S DUTIES.



   (A)   Chairperson. The Mayor, when present, shall act as presiding
officer of all meetings of the City Council. In the absence of the Mayor, the
Mayor Pro Tem shall act as presiding officer. In the absence of both the
Mayor and the Mayor Pro Tem, the longest-serving Council member, including
all combined terms and years of service on the Council, shall act as
presiding officer.



   (B)   Substitution procedure for presiding officer.  In the case of
the Mayor’s absence or recusal due to conflict of interest, the Mayor will
call on the Mayor Pro Tem, or the longest-serving Council member then present
and available, to temporarily preside over the meeting. Said temporary
arrangement shall not continue beyond adjournment, or cessation of discussion
of the matter requiring recusal.



   (C)   Council rules. These rules, including any amendments to these
rules which may be made from time to time, shall be effective when adopted by
a majority vote of the entire Council.



   (D)   Call to order.  The meetings of the Council shall be formally
called to order by the presiding officer.



   (E)   Right of floor.  Any Council member desiring to speak shall
be first recognized by the Mayor, unless requesting to be recognized or
seconding a motion. Council members shall confine their remarks to the
subject under consideration.



   (F)   Order and decorum.  The presiding officer shall preserve
order and decorum, and shall decide all questions of order, subject to an
appeal to the Council. The presiding officer shall ensure that debate and
discussion of an agenda item focuses on the item and the policy in question.
The presiding officer shall abide by the following rules when controlling
discussion:



      (1)   Debate on policy is healthy and necessary, but ad
hominem criticisms of other Council members is not. The Mayor has the right
to stop discussion which is personal in nature, abusive, unduly loud,
inappropriate, repetitive or excessively time-consuming.



      (2)   One person shall have the floor at a time and the
speaker shall be recognized by the presiding officer before proceeding to
speak.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.07  ROLE OF CITY STAFF AT COUNCIL MEETINGS.



   (A)   City Administrator.  The City Administrator or designee shall
attend all meetings of the Council unless excused by the Mayor. The City
Administrator shall make recommendations to the Council when appropriate,
either in writing prior to the meeting, or orally as necessary during the
meeting.



   (B)   City Attorney.  The City Attorney or designee shall attend
all meetings of the Council, unless excused by the Mayor or the City
Administrator. The City Attorney shall act as the Council’s parliamentarian
when present.



   (C)   City Clerk.  The City Clerk or designee shall attend all
meetings of the Council, unless excused by the Mayor or the City
Administrator, and shall keep the official minutes and perform such other
duties at the meeting as may be requested by the Council.



   (D)   City employees.  Department heads or other designated
employees of the city shall attend the Council meetings, unless excused by
the Mayor or the City Administrator.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.08  TYPES OF MEETINGS, NOTICE AND PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Notices of, and agendas for, all meetings of the City Council,
appointed boards, committees or commissions shall be given in compliance with
the requirements of I.A.C. § 21.4. Meeting notices shall be posted by the
City Clerk, or designee, at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. Likewise,
any established boards, commissions or committees established by the City
Council shall follow the same procedures.



   (B)   The City Council meeting agenda and pertinent packet
information shall be posted on the city’s website, www.marshalltown-ia.gov.
The Mayor and Council members should contact the City Clerk with any routine
questions concerning the agenda prior to the meeting. Questions regarding
policy issues on the agenda and clarification of action items should be
directed to the City Administrator ahead of the meeting, whenever possible.



   (C)   All official meetings of the Council, appointed boards,
committees or commissions shall be open to the public, except those legally
designated as closed sessions. Regular Council meetings shall be held in a
building or room that is accessible to persons with disabilities, which shall
normally be the Council chambers at the city hall, located on the second
floor of the building at 10 West State Street. For Council meetings held in
part or in whole at other locations for any purpose, that meeting space shall
be accessible to persons with disabilities to the maximum extent possible.
Special arrangements for the hearing impaired, or for interpreters, will be
considered upon request to the City Clerk’s office.



      (1)   Regular meeting.  The regular Council meetings will be
held the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except when the regular
meeting date is a holiday, in which event the meeting will be held at noon on
the next day. Meetings will commence at 5:30 p.m., unless the Council directs
otherwise.



      (2)   Work sessions.



         (a)   The Council may meet informally as needed in work
sessions which are open to the public. Starting times will be dependent on
the number of items scheduled for discussion. The purposes for work sessions
include, but are not limited to, budget sessions, joint meetings, reviewing
upcoming programs, receiving progress reports on current programs, receiving
information from the City Administrator or discussing other matters of
concern. No formal action on any item may be taken at a work session, but
matters may, by motion, be placed on the agenda for a later City Council
meeting.



         (b)   Items may be placed on the work session agenda by
the City Administrator, Mayor or a Council member. The City Attorney or other
city staff may place items on the agenda if approved by the City
Administrator. Agenda items must be submitted at least five days prior to the
scheduled work session. No public comment shall be permitted during a work
session unless public comment is specifically called for on the agenda, or
unless solicited by the presiding officer.



      (3)   Special meetings.  Special meetings of the City Council
may be held if called by the Mayor, with the required public notice under
I.A.C. Ch. 21. In such cases, the Mayor shall provide written notice to each
Council member by email or other appropriate means. The cost of calling a
special Council meeting for approval of a permit, license or similar
instrument is $500 and shall be the responsibility of the petitioner.



      (4)   Open session.  Except as provided in the Iowa Code, all
actions and discussions at meetings of governmental bodies, whether formal or
informal, shall be conducted and executed in open session.



      (5)   Closed and exempt sessions.



         (a)   I.A.C. § 20.17 permits public bodies to hold
exempt sessions (such as, not subject to the Open Meetings Law) to discuss
collective bargaining with their bargaining representatives. I.A.C. §§ 21.5
and 21.9 permit closed sessions for certain limited, and narrowly defined,
reasons. A vote to go into a closed session requires an affirmative vote of
either two-thirds of the Council members or all of the Council members
present at the meeting. No ordinance, resolution, motion or other formal
action may be taken in closed session.



         (b)   In the case of any exempt or closed session, the
agenda shall be drafted with the assistance of legal counsel to state the
specific statutory basis under which the closed session will be held. The
City Attorney or other legal counsel shall provide, in writing, the legal
basis for the closed session and provide the same to the Mayor and Council
prior to the meeting or, in the alternative, the City Attorney or outside
legal counsel shall attend the meeting and state publicly the basis for the
closed session. Said written or oral opinion shall specify the particular
Iowa Code section which allows the exempt or closed session and a short
statement of why the subject matter to be discussed in closed session makes
the section applicable. The Council shall not enter closed session until this
opinion is provided.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.09  PUBLIC HEARINGS.



   (A)   Informal public hearings.  An informal public hearing is
called in order to give the public an opportunity to comment on a matter of
public interest before the Council. Informal hearings are not required by
state law or city ordinance. The board, committee or commission concerned may
set rules for notifying the public of an informal hearing, establish a time
frame and conduct the hearing in any fair manner it chooses.



   (B)   Formal public hearings.  A formal public hearing is one
required by state laws or city ordinances and is designed to solicit comment
from the general public.



   (C)   Hearing procedures.



      (1)   Hearings shall be fair and impartial. If a Council
member has a personal interest in the outcome of a hearing, such that there
is a legally recognized conflict of interest, he or she should disqualify
himself or herself from participation.



      (2)   Persons and groups who may be affected by the matter
being discussed in the hearing shall be provided at least the minimum
statutory notice of the time and place of the hearing. Such persons and
groups attending the hearing shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard. Persons or groups requesting to address the Council may be represented
by legal counsel and may present oral and documentary evidence.



      (3)   The presiding officer should open the hearing and
explain the hearing procedures. The presiding officer should inquire whether
any comment on the public matter at issue has been received in the Clerk’s
office, and the Clerk should then relate any such comments for the record.



      (4)   Following the report of the Clerk, the public should be
invited to address the Council. If there are numerous persons representing
the same views and opinions, the presiding officer may ask that a
spokesperson be selected to speak on behalf of the group. If this arrangement
cannot be made, the presiding officer may restrict each speaker to a limited
time (generally three minutes) so that all may be heard. Irrelevant comments
or speakers who run over the time allotted may be ruled out of order by the
presiding officer.



      (5)   Following comments from the public, staff persons who
have information to present should be invited to present their respective
reports.



      (6)   When all interested persons (except as reasonably
limited by the presiding officer, as stated above) have had the opportunity
to speak, the hearing is closed, ending audience participation. Council
members may then discuss and take action on the proposal following the
hearing if notice of such action is stated on the meeting agenda.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.10  MEDIA COVERAGE OF COUNCIL MEETINGS.



   (A)   Open meetings.  All official meetings of the City Council
shall be open to the public and the media. All meetings may be recorded by
radio, television and photographic services at any time, provided that such
arrangements do not interfere with the orderly conduct of the meetings.



   (B)   Agendas.  Agendas may be obtained by members of the media by
contacting the City Clerk (754-5701) or by downloading the agenda from the
city’s website. Further, printed agendas are available at each City Council
meeting.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.11  MEETING CONDUCT.



   (A)   Disorderly conduct.



      (1)   No person shall disrupt the orderly conduct of a Council
meeting. Prohibited disruptive behavior includes, but is not limited to,
shouting, making disruptive noises, such as boos or hisses, creating or
participating in a physical disturbance, speaking out of turn or in violation
of applicable rules, preventing or attempting to prevent others who have the
floor from speaking, preventing others from observing the meeting, entering
into or remaining in an area of the meeting room that is not open to the
public, or approaching the Council table without consent. Any message to or
contact with any Council member while the Council is in session must be made
through the City Clerk.



         (a)   Recognition by Mayor. Council members shall not
address the meeting until recognized by the presiding officer.



         (b)   Two or more speakers. When two or more Council
members request to be recognized at once, the presiding officer shall
recognize and name the Council member who is to speak first.



         (c)   Speaking more than once on one question. No
Council member shall be recognized to speak twice on the same matter until
every Council member desiring to comment on the matter has spoken.



         (d)   Inappropriate language and behavior. The Mayor,
Council members, City Administrator and staff shall at all times conduct
themselves civilly. No person shall be permitted to shout, curse or use
personally offensive language directed at other individuals.



         (e)   Person called to order. Any person called to order
by the presiding officer shall immediately desist in the objectionable
behavior.



         (f)   Private discourse prohibited. While any person is
addressing the meeting, who has been duly recognized by the presiding
officer, no person shall hold any disruptive or distracting private
conversation.



         (g)   Removal. Any of the following shall be sufficient
cause for law enforcement personnel, by order of the presiding officer, to
remove any person from the Council chambers or meeting hall for the duration
of the meeting:



            1.   Unreasonably loud or disruptive language,
noise or conduct which obstructs the work of conducting of the business of
the Council;



            2.   Willful injury of furnishings or of the
interior of the Council chambers or meeting hall;



            3.   Refusal to obey the rules of conduct,
including the limitations on occupancy and seating capacity; or



            4.   Refusal to obey an order of the presiding
officer or an order approved by a majority of the Council present.



      (2)   Except where a disruptive person presents a physical
danger to others (in which case law enforcement personnel will immediate
apprehend and remove the person), the presiding officer shall give a warning
to a disruptive person before ordering the person’s removal. If a meeting
is disrupted by more than one member of the audience and where it appears a
general breakdown of order has occurred or will occur, the presiding officer
or a majority of the Council present may order that the Council chambers or
other meeting hall be cleared.



   (B)   Enforcement of decorum.  The presiding officer is the
Sergeant-at-Arms of the Council meetings. That person maintains order and
decorum at the Council meetings. Physical removal, when necessary, will be
undertaken by law enforcement personnel.



   (C)   Action by verbal motion.  Verbal motions of the Council shall
be stated clearly. In the case of an ambiguous or confusing motion capable of
several interpretations, the presiding officer shall, as soon as practicable
following the initial statement of the motion, clarify the intent of the
motion so as to ensure all Council members understand its meaning and intent.
In such cases, Council members should be asked to amend their motions by
friendly amendment.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.12  AGENDA PREPARATION.



   (A)   Agenda deadline.  Except in cases of pressing need or
emergency, no business may be submitted for placement on the regular Council
agenda after 12:00 p.m. of the fifth day (Wednesday) prior to the meeting
day. Items may be placed on the agenda by the City Administrator, Mayor or a
Council member. The City Attorney or other city staff may place items on the
agenda if approved by the City Administrator. When a holiday falls on a
Friday, the City Clerk may revise the agenda cutoff time and shall, with the
concurrence of the City Administrator, notify all staff, the Mayor and
Council members of the same.



   (B)   Agenda and agenda packet preparation.



      (1)   The Mayor, City Administrator and City Clerk are
responsible for preparation of the agenda and packet. Council members should
promptly review their packets and contact the City Administrator if there are
any questions regarding the information. The Mayor and City Administrator,
after considering any requests for agenda items, shall approve the tentative
agenda. Any request for an agenda item from the general public shall not be
placed on the agenda unless and until timely requested by the Mayor or City
Administrator. Staff may also place on the agenda items brought forward by
the public, if approved by the City Administrator.



      (2)   Council members should, whenever possible, avoid using
Council meeting time as a fact-finding exercise. Council members are instead
encouraged to consult with the City Administrator ahead of the meeting to
clarify any packet materials which are unclear. Meeting time should be used,
as much as possible, for bona fide debate of public matters, rather than fact
gathering which could have been accomplished with due diligence before the
meeting.



      (3)   Agendas for public meetings shall be posted at city hall
and shall be made available to the Mayor and City Council, city department
directors and to the local media. At 5:00 p.m. on the Friday prior to Council
meetings, the agenda packets are taken to the Police Department where
officials may pick them up throughout the weekend. The agenda packets are
also posted to the city’s website for viewing by the  general public.



   (C)   Withdrawn items.  Agenda items may be withdrawn by either the
Mayor or the City Administrator prior to agenda distribution. Further, under
circumstances where unforeseen problems are discovered with an agenda item
after distribution of the agenda, the agenda may be modified as necessary by
the Mayor.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.13  ORDER OF BUSINESS.



   (A)   Generally. The order of business shall be as contained in the
agenda. The order of business may also be changed by majority vote of Council
members present, for reasons of efficiency. Reasons of efficiency include,
but may not be limited to, the convenience of persons attending the meeting,
the lateness of the hour and similar concerns.  Meetings shall normally be
conducted in the following order:



      (1)   Call meeting to order;



      (2)   Pledge of allegiance;



      (3)   Roll call;



      (4)   Comments by the Mayor, Council members, City
Administrator and presentations. Informational, explanatory or educational
comments by the Mayor, Council members and City Administrator which do not
require any action. These comments may also include announcements of events,
welcoming special guests or recognition of an achievement;



      (5)   Consent agenda. The consent agenda shall consist of
non-controversial, routine items such as, but not limited to, refunds,
routine appointments not requiring Council approval, department reports,
applications, simple service contracts already vetted by city staff and not
requiring Council attention, and communications not requiring action. The
items comprising the consent agenda will not be considered individually, but
will be adopted on one motion. Council members or the Mayor may remove any
item on the consent agenda for individual discussion, and no second shall be
required. No vote on such a request shall be required;



      (6)   Reports. The Council may request reports from
cooperating agencies or private groups who are working with the Council on
official projects or other community initiatives;



      (7)   Motions. Motions are proposals to move a matter forward
or to take some action in circumstances where no written resolution has been
prepared. Council members should make a motion when there is new or
non-routine business requiring Council discussion prior to a vote, including,
but not limited to, new liquor licenses and cigarette permits. Example: “I
move the liquor license for XYZ Restaurant be approved.” Any motions
concerning any procedure matter, such as the order of business or the general
conduct of the meeting, may be made prior to the consideration of other
business;



      (8)   Resolutions. Resolutions are written directives of the
City Council directing certain actions, such as the approval of contracts.
Resolutions typically direct the Mayor to sign the resolution and frequently
direct the City Clerk to take whatever actions are necessary to carry out the
resolution, such as to “place the contract on file in the usual manner.”
Resolutions are necessary for more formal actions where a definite record of
Council action is important. Resolutions presented and seconded shall first
be discussed by the City Council and Mayor. After discussion by the Council
and Mayor, a resolution may, at the discretion of the presiding officer, be
addressed by members of the general public upon the same conditions provided
under public comments. A resolution pertaining directly to other items of
business should be placed first in order of resolutions being considered.
Resolutions requiring a public hearing shall be considered immediately
following the public hearing. Resolutions requiring a public hearing will be
considered last in order of resolutions;



      (8)   Ordinances.  Ordinances are the laws of the city. 
Ordinances must be read, considered and passed three separate times at three
separate meetings of the City Council in order to become law. However, if the
agenda provides the required public notice, a motion may be made to allow all
three readings to occur at one meeting. If the motion is approved by
three-fourths of all Council members (such as, not just those Council members
present), then the requirement of making the readings at three separate
meetings may be waived, and all three readings may occur at the present
meeting. Such a motion to waive the three meetings requirement may
occasionally be appropriate when an ordinance is not controversial and where
time is of the essence. After discussion by the Council, members of the
general public may, at the discretion of the presiding officer, address an
ordinance, upon the same conditions as provided under public comments. An
ordinance which requires a public hearing prior to adoption will be placed
last in the order of ordinances being considered. In the case of any
ordinance to amend or repeal an ordinance or section of an ordinance, the
proposed amendment shall contain the entire text of the ordinance or section
to be amended or repealed. Ordinances amending or repealing existing
ordinances shall be drafted to repeal the former ordinance or section in its
entirety, and set forth the entire text of the proposed ordinance or section,
as amended;



      (9)   Discussion. Items placed on the agenda solely for
discussion purposes will not be acted upon. Such discussion items determined
to require action may be placed on a subsequent agenda by motion or, if no
motion is made, by placement of the item on a subsequent meeting agenda
through the usual process described in the “Agenda Preparation” section
of these rules;



      (10)   Public comment. Members of the general public may,
during the allotted timeframe on the meeting agenda, make comments on any
item which was not on the agenda. The proposed speaker shall, after being
recognized by the presiding officer, approach the microphone, and state his
or her name and address. Comments shall be limited to three minutes, unless a
longer comment is authorized by the presiding officer. The speaker shall
direct comments to the presiding officer and to the Council as a whole. The
presiding officer and Council members shall not engage in discussion or
debate on items raised by members of the public unless the subject matter
concerns an item on the posted agenda. No action may be taken on items raised
in public comments; and



      (11)   Adjournment.



   (B)   Individual electronic participation.  An absent Council
member may participate electronically in any City Council meeting by speaker
phone or other device, provided the comments of the Council member are
plainly audible to the public.



   (C)   Quorum.  A quorum is necessary for the conduct of business. A
majority of the Council members shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not
present, those in attendance may elect to discuss items, but may not take
official action, except to adjourn to a later date.



   (D)   Recording of votes.  Affirmative and negative votes shall be
recorded on all ordinances and resolutions and entered into the official
minutes of the City Council. The outcome of a vote on a motion shall be
announced by the Mayor and recorded by the Clerk.



   (E)   Majority vote required.  Unless otherwise provided by state
code, an affirmative vote of at least four Council members shall be necessary
to pass an ordinance or resolution. When any vote is called, each Council
member shall respond: “yes,” “no” or “abstain.” An “abstain”
vote of a Council member is a “no” vote, unless the Council member states
he or she has a conflict of interest and states the nature of the conflict.
In the case of a conflict of interest, the number of votes to approve any
action is recalculated to exclude the abstaining Council member. For example,
if two Council members abstain due to a conflict of interest, an item could
pass on a three to two vote (provided the vote does not require a majority of
the entire Council).



   (F)   Ordinance and resolution passage procedure.  When passed by
the City Council, an ordinance or resolution shall be signed by the legally
required person (normally the Mayor) and shall be attested to by the City
Clerk. It shall be immediately filed and thereafter preserved in the office
of the City Clerk.



   (G)   Publications.  All minutes, ordinances and notices will be
published as required by state law.



   (H)   Consideration of emergency matters.  If, under I.A.C. §
21.4(2), and after conferring with the City Attorney, the City Council
determines by majority vote that an emergency exists, agenda items may be
added without 24 hours’ notice to the public. In such cases, the reasons
for said emergency shall be noted in the minutes and, particularly, the
reasons why the Council determined the items could not reasonably be deferred
to a later meeting. Such action should rarely occur, and only when the
Council believes irreparable harm will occur if action is not taken
immediately.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.14  VOTING AND DISCUSSION ON MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS.



   (A)   Generally. No motion or resolution shall be debated unless
seconded. When a matter is seconded, the Mayor shall restate the motion or
resolution and open the floor for debate.



      (1)   Three-minute rule. Council members speaking on a matter
shall confine their remarks strictly to the matter under consideration and
shall limit their remarks to three minutes in duration.



      (2)   Vote required when present. Every Council member present
when a question is stated from the presiding officer shall vote thereon,
unless the Council member has declared a conflict of interest in the outcome
of the question under consideration.



      (3)   Motion or resolution withdrawn. After a motion or
resolution is seconded and stated by the Mayor, it may be withdrawn at any
time before decision, but if any amendment has been proposed and adopted, it
shall not be withdrawn without the consent of the mover of such amendment.



      (4)   Several distinct propositions. If the question in debate
contains several distinct propositions, any Council member may have the same
divided, and the item(s) considered separately.



   (B)   Votes recorded.  In all cases where a resolution or a motion
is entered in the minutes of the City Council, the name of the Council member
moving the same shall be stated in the minutes.



      (1)   “Yeses” and “nos” recorded. The “yeses” and
“nos” upon any question shall be entered in the minutes.



      (2)   Blanks.  When a blank is to be filled, and different
sums or times are proposed, the question shall be taken first on the largest
sum, or the longest time.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.15  PROCEDURE FOR MAKING A MOTION.



   (A)   When a Council member wishes to propose an idea for discussion
and possible action, the Council member must make a motion. In order to make
a motion, these steps must be taken:



      (1)   The Council member asks to be recognized by the
presiding officer;



      (2)   After being recognized, the Council member makes the
motion (“I move...”);



      (3)   Another Council member seconds the motion;



      (4)   The presiding officer states the motion and asks for
discussion;



      (5)   When there has been sufficient discussion, the presiding
officer will close debate (“Are you ready for the question?” or “Is
there any further discussion?”);



      (6)   If no one requests to make additional comments, the
presiding officer puts the question to vote; and



      (7)   After the vote, the presiding officer announces the
outcome of the motion (“The motion is carried” or “Motion fails”).



   (B)   Until the presiding officer states the motion, the Council
member making the motion may rephrase (amend) or withdraw it. After an
amendment, the motion as amended must still be seconded and then voted upon.
It is particularly important when a motion is amended that the presiding
officer restate the motion, as amended.



   (C)   In making a motion, Council members must avoid combining
multiple proposals in the same motion. If a Council member prefers to see
proposals divided and voted upon separately, the Council member should ask
the presiding officer to divide the motion into separate motions for
consideration. The presiding officer may then proceed to treat each distinct
proposal as a distinct motion, each requiring its own second, and to be acted
upon separately. The presiding officer should solicit motions when the
situation demands by either inviting a motion or suggesting a motion to the
Council members.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.16  THE FOUR BASIC MOTIONS.



   (A)   The basic motion. Puts forward a decision for consideration.
Example: “I move that we create a five-member committee to plan the annual
fundraiser.”



   (B)   The motion to amend. Changes a basic motion under
consideration. Example: “I move we amend the motion to have a ten-member
committee.” A motion to amend requires a second and must be decided before
the Council returns to consideration of the original motion.



   (C)   The motion to postpone to a date certain. Proposes delay in
further discussion of the matter under consideration until a specific, stated
time at which the item will be debated further. Example: “I move we
postpone further discussion of this item until our first regular meeting in
October.”



   (D)   The motion to lay on the table. Postpones discussion of an
item indefinitely, unless taken off the table. Example: “I move we table
this item.” Tabling an item leaves it on the table and no specific time is
stated for further discussion. It stays “on the table,” until a later
agenda item provides notice it will be brought from the table for further
discussion.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.17  DEBATE.



   (A)   Most motions, except for procedural motions, such as calling
the previous question, adjournment, and the like, are debatable. Debate may
continue as long as Council members wish to discuss an item, subject to any
motion for previous question, which ends debate. Absent a successful motion
for previous question, debate will end if the presiding officer solicits
further comments and none are forthcoming.



   (B)   Some motions are not debatable. The presiding officer should
immediately call for a vote of the Council, without debate on the following:



      (1)   Motion to adjourn. This motion, if passed, requires the
Council to immediately adjourn to its next regularly scheduled meeting. This
motion requires a simple majority vote.



      (2)   Motion to end debate or the “previous question.” The
most common form of this motion is to say: “I move the previous
question,” or “I move the question,” or “I call for the question.”
When a Council member makes such a motion, the Council member is really
saying, “I’ve had enough debate. Let’s get on with the vote.” The
motion requires a second. If the motion carries by two-thirds majority of
those Council members present, all further debate is concluded, and the
question put in this order: first upon the amendments pending and then upon
the main proposition before the Council.



      (3)   Motion to limit debate. An alternative to the previous
question is a motion to limit debate, which includes, by its stated terms, a
time limit. For example: “I move we limit debate on this agenda item to 15
minutes.” The motion to limit debate requires a two-thirds vote of the
Council.



      (4)   Motion objecting to consideration. A similar motion is a
motion objecting to consideration of an item. This motion is not debatable
and, if passed, precludes the Council from even considering an item on the
agenda. It also requires a two-thirds vote.



      (5)   Motion to lay on the table. A motion to lay a question
upon the table is not debatable.



      (6)   Motion to postpone to a date certain. A motion to
postpone to a date certain is not debatable (except for discussion of the
specific date).



      (7)   Motion to refer to committee. This motion directs that
the item under consideration be sent to a committee for further analysis and
recommendations.



      (8)   Motion to fix the time to adjourn. This motion, if
passed, requires the Council to adjourn the meeting at the specific time set
in the motion. For example, the motion might be: “I move we adjourn this
meeting at midnight.” It requires a simple majority vote.



      (9)   Motion to recess. This motion, if passed, requires the
Council to immediately take a recess. Normally, the presiding officer
determines the length of the recess, which may range from a few minutes to an
hour. It requires a simple majority vote.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.18  MAJORITY AND SUPER-MAJORITY VOTES.



   In addition to the specific rules for passage of motions, resolutions
and ordinances as set by state law, there are procedural exceptions to the
rule of passage by a simple majority. The exceptions occur when the City
Council is taking an action that effectively cuts off the ability of a
minority opinion to take an action or discuss an item. These extraordinary
motions require a two-thirds majority (a super-majority) to pass:



   (A)   Motions to limit debate. Whether a Council member says, “I
move the previous question,” “I move the question,” “I call for the
question,” or “I move to limit debate,” these motions, if successful,
cut off the ability of the minority to discuss an item.



   (B)   Motion to object to the consideration of a question. Normally,
such a motion is unnecessary, because the objectionable item is usually
tabled or defeated. However, when Council members do not wish there to be any
consideration of an item, such a motion is in order. It is not debatable.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.19  MOTION TO RECONSIDER.



   (A)   After a vote is taken, the matter is deemed concluded and is
subject to reconsideration only upon a timely motion. A motion to reconsider
shall only be made by a Council member who originally voted in favor of the
measure (such as, a Council member on the prevailing side). A motion to
reconsider requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass, but there are two
limitations: First, a motion to reconsider may be made at the meeting where
the item was first voted upon. The motion maybe made at any time before
adjournment. A motion to reconsider may also be made in the case of a failed
measure, if made at a subsequent meeting within ten days of the original
measure’s failure by a Council member who voted against the measure.



   (B)   If the motion to reconsider passes, then the original matter
is back before the City Council, and a new original motion is in order.



   (C)   The matter may be discussed and debated as if it were on the
floor for the first time.



   (D)   Once a matter has been duly reconsidered, no further motion to
reconsider the issue can or shall be made without the unanimous consent of
the City Council.



   (E)   No question shall be reconsidered more than once, nor shall a
vote to reconsider be reconsidered. This rule does not prevent substantively
different iterations of the measure from being brought forth at later
meetings of the Council. Further, once a new City Council is seated following
the next regular election, any matter may be revived.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.20  LIMITING DEBATE AND DISCUSSION.



   (A)   Debate and discussion should be focused, but free and open. At
the same time, the Mayor may limit the time allotted to speakers, including
Council members, in the interest of efficiently and effectively using time.



   (B)   Generally, a Council member will not be interrupted by other
Council members, but may be under the following circumstances:



      (1)   Privilege. The proper interruption would be: “Point of
privilege.” The Mayor would then ask the interrupter to “state your
point.” Appropriate points of privilege relate to anything that would
interfere with the comfort of the meeting participants. For example, the room
may be too hot or too cold, or a blowing fan might interfere with a
person’s ability to hear.



      (2)   Order. The proper interruption would be: “Point of
order.” The Mayor would ask the interrupter to “state your point.”
Appropriate points of order relate to anything that would not be considered
appropriate conduct of the meeting; for example, if the Mayor moved to a vote
on a motion that permits debate without allowing discussion or debate.



      (3)   Appeal. If the Mayor makes a ruling with which a Council
member disagrees, that Council member may appeal the ruling of the Mayor to
the parliamentarian.



      (4)   Call for orders of the day. This is another way of
saying, “Let’s return to the agenda.” If a Council member believes the
Council has drifted from the agenda, such a call may be made. It does not
require a vote, and when the Mayor discovers that the agenda has not been
followed, the Mayor simply reminds the Council to return to the agenda item
properly before them.



      (5)   Withdraw a motion. During debate and discussion of a
motion, the maker of the motion on the floor may, at any time, interrupt a
speaker to withdraw his or her motion from the floor. The motion is
immediately deemed withdrawn, although the Mayor may ask the person who
seconded the motion if he or she wishes to make the motion, and any other
Council member may make the motion, if properly recognized.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.21  ADJOURNMENT.



   When the City Council has finished its business, the Mayor may declare
the meeting adjourned.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.22  MINUTES.



   (A)   Minutes of all proceedings of the City Council shall be kept
by the City Clerk, or designee, and shall be entered in the official record
of the Council. Minutes of the proceedings shall be open to public
inspection, except those of closed sessions. Minutes shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within 15 days of the Council meeting, as
required by the Iowa Code. City Council policy does not require that minutes
be recorded verbatim. Minutes record the essence of decisions made and of
actions taken. Minutes shall show the date, time and place of the meeting,
Council members present, action taken, the results of each vote taken, and
information sufficient to indicate the vote of each Council member present.



   (B)   Minutes of meetings and closed session recordings are retained
as required by state law. Minutes of all meetings must be prepared by the
City Clerk, or the City Clerk’s designee, secretary of the board, committee
or commission, or that body’s staff liaison. A copy of all such minutes
must be filed with the City Clerk’s office. Upon approval by the board,
committee or commission, written minutes constitute the official record of
its activities. Personal notes or recordings made by the City Clerk for
personal reference and convenience in preparing minutes shall not be
considered part of the record and need not be preserved.



   (C)   Additions and corrections to the minutes may be made only in
public meetings, with the approval of the Council, and not by private request
of individual Council members.



   (D)   Minutes of boards, committees and commissions are available on
the city’s website for viewing by the City Council and general public.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.23  CREATION OF COMMITTEES, BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.



   Please refer to the Board and Commission Manual for more information.
Any resident of the city may be considered a candidate for appointment to
boards, committees and commissions. Applicants complete an application form
stating their interests and background information. Appointments on boards,
committees or commissions are announced by the Mayor at regular City Council
meetings. Applications for these appointive positions are available at the
City Clerk’s office and on the city’s website. The completed applications
are reviewed by the Mayor, who recommends appointees to the Council. Final
appointment is made by an affirmative vote of a majority of the City Council.



   (A)   Purpose of committees, boards and commissions.



      (1)   As permitted by the Iowa Code and the code of
ordinances, the Mayor and/or the City Council may create committees, boards
and commissions to assist with such public duties as the Council may specify.
All Council members, the Mayor, City Administrator and City Attorney are
welcome to attend any meeting of a committee, board or commission. Notice of
committee, board and commission meetings will be given to the entire Council
and the Mayor and posted for the public.



      (2)   Any special or ad-hoc committee will be formally
approved by the City Council. When a board, committee or commission is
established by the City Council, the specific duties of the group are set
forth in the ordinance or resolution which created it. An advisory body is
limited to consideration of those matters specifically assigned to it. If a
commission, board or committee determines its activities should be expanded
beyond its existing authority, the commission, board or committee should
formally request specific authorization from the City Council to consider the
additional matters and to formulate recommendations accordingly.



      (3)   Special committees shall report their findings and
recommendations in writing. All recommendations shall be approved by a
majority of the committee before presentation to the City Council as a whole,
though a minority report and recommendation may likewise be made, and the
Council shall consider both reports. Committees will make reports to the City
Council as requested by the Council. All committee recommendations, decisions
or proposed actions shall be subject to the final approval and adoption of
the City Council. Upon submission of a final report to the City Council, the
special or ad-hoc committee shall dissolve, unless tasked with additional
work by the Council.



      (4)   Special committees of the City Council shall be
empowered to require the attendance of witnesses, and for that purpose, the
chairperson of such committee is authorized to issue subpoenas. Subpoenas
shall be provided to the Chief of Police, who shall immediately cause service
of the same on the summoned individuals, in the usual manner required by law.



   (B)   Membership and selections.  Membership and selection of
members shall be as provided by the Mayor and the City Council if not
specified by the Code of Iowa or the code of ordinances. No committee so
appointed shall have powers other than advisory to the City Council or the
City Administrator, except as otherwise specified by the code of ordinances
or the Code of Iowa. Members of boards, committees and commissions should be
independent of the City Council, or other boards, committees and commissions,
and of other governmental units, so they may exercise unbiased judgment in
addressing the tasks and issues before them.



   (C)   Gender balance.  In 2009, the Iowa Legislature passed a law
requiring appointive boards and commissions to be gender balanced by 2012, or
as close as possible for boards and commissions with an uneven number of
members. Only after making a good faith effort for 90 days to find sufficient
volunteers to create gender balance may the city proceed to fill positions in
a manner which does not evenly balance boards and commissions.



   (D)   Ineligible appointments.  The following persons shall not be
eligible for appointments to standing boards, committees or commissions of
the city:



      (1)   Spouse, child, mother, father, mother-in-law,
father-in-law, brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepmother,
stepfather, stepchild, aunt or uncle of a current City Council member; or



      (2)   A current member of a comparable county board, committee
or commission, unless dual or joint memberships are provided for in the
ordinance, resolution or statute, which creates the board, committee or
commission to which appointment is being made.



   (E)   Council and commission effectiveness.  The City Council and
all appointed advisory boards, committees and commissions are policy-oriented
groups. The advisory groups operate as satellite units, which focus on
particular concerns, issues or problems in the community. When an advisory
board, committee or commission has an item on a City Council meeting agenda,
a representative from that body shall be present at the City Council meeting.
Similarly, when a member of any board, committee or commission addresses the
City Council at a public meeting, he or she should always clearly state
whether he or she is speaking on behalf of the advisory group or as an
individual.



   (F)   Interactions with City Council; procedural guidelines.  The
City Council considers input and recommendations from a variety of sources in
its decision-making process. Therefore, the Council may not always follow the
specific recommendations of any one particular board, committee or commission
in adopting policy or procedure. Once the Council has established its
position, members of advisory groups may continue to have reservations or
individual objections. As representatives of the larger group, however,
members should remember they are expected to act in a manner consistent with
the established policy and/or program as approved by the City Council.



   (G)   Council policy on legislative issues. 



      (1)   The City Council is ultimately responsible for
establishing city policy and determines the public position of the city on
legislative matters. Therefore, commissions, boards or committees shall not
issue public statements on legislation pending before the City Council,
unless said statements are reviewed and approved by the Council.



      (2)   This policy is not intended to prevent advisory groups
from carrying out their normal functions publicly and openly; rather, its
purpose is to establish that boards, committees and commissions do not issue
policy statements or take public positions which fall within the purview of
the City Council.



   (H)   Submitting a formal request for consideration; procedure.  In
the event a board, committee or commission wishes to request the City Council
endorse or approve a particular position or idea formulated by the board,
committee or commission, said request should first be reflected in the
minutes of the meeting of the board, committee or commission at which the
action was approved. Following such action, the board, committee or
commission’s secretary or staff liaison should submit a written request to
the City Council, with a copy to the City Administrator’s office for
inclusion on the agenda of an upcoming Council committee or City Council
meeting. In the interim, copies of the request will be made available to all
Council members. The communication should include the degree of urgency and a
specific statement of the action requested.



   (I)   Relations with the public.  Council members and members of
appointed boards, committees or commissions are encouraged to maintain
awareness of public opinion. Citizen input should be welcomed and heard at
meetings, and members should be considerate of all interests, attitudes and
differences of opinion. Members should be vigilant about maintaining not only
the appearance, but also the principle of impartiality.



   (J)   Conflicts of interest.



      (1)   To determine whether an applicant to a board, commission
or committee has a conflict of interest, applicants should review I.A.C. Chs.
362.5, 362.6 and 403A. Assistance is available from the City Attorney’s
office if applicants have questions about this matter.



      (2)   In the event a City Council member determines that he or
she has a direct, definite (demonstrable) conflict of interest regarding an
issue before the Council, that conflict should be clearly stated at the
beginning of Council deliberations. Council members should consult the City
Attorney, or private counsel of their own choosing, prior to deliberating or
voting on a matter on which the Council member believes he or she may have a
conflict of interest. The matter of what constitutes a “conflict of
interest” is often misunderstood and misstated. People elected to public
office are frequently motivated to seek office because of their personal
interest in certain issues. The mere fact that their lives may generally be
affected, either positively or negatively, by a decision of the City Council
does not, by itself, create a conflict of interest. Rather, a legally
significant conflict of interest stems from a conflict between a direct,
definite and demonstrable personal interest of the Council member
(particularly pecuniary, business or familial) and the judgment the Council
member must exercise in the matter to be decided. Whether a conflict of
interest exists can only be determined by applying the individual facts to
the law. Again, Council members should consult legal counsel if in doubt
about a conflict of interest issue.



      (3)   Another matter arises from time to time which may create
the appearance of a conflict of interest. Elected officials are frequently
solicited to join such organizations as the Chamber of Commerce, Marshall
Economic Development and the like. Participation in these organizations
results in an exchange of valuable information and views. Nevertheless, when
such an organization takes a position in favor of or in resistance to a
proposal pending before the City Council, at the very least the appearance of
a conflict of interest exists. It may appear to the layperson that membership
in the organization involved would create an irreconcilable conflict of
interest. A case might be made that a City Council member has a conflict of
interest while he or she is a member of an organization, if that organization
appears before the City Council and takes an official position on an issue.
Under such circumstances, it may be advisable for elected officials to
abstain from voting on that issue. Again, consultation with legal counsel is
advised.



      (4)   City officers or employees are restricted by I.A.C. §
362.5 with regard to direct or indirect benefits they may receive from any
contract performed for the city. That code section provides as follows: “A
city officer or employee shall not have an interest, direct or indirect, in
any contract or job of work, or material, or the profits thereof, or services
to be furnished or performed for the officers or employees of the city. A
contract entered into in violation of this section is void.”



   (K)   Gifts.



      (1)   The state covers restrictions of gifts in I.A.C. Ch.
68B. Any questions regarding the acceptance of gifts should be directed to
the City Attorney.



      (2)   The City Council feels it is important to recognize
special achievements among its citizens and employees. For that reason, the
Council has authorized the purchase of plaques, certificates and memorabilia
for the purpose of distinguishing special service. City staff is authorized
to purchase such materials as necessary to carry out this policy.



   (L)   Communications between staff, City Council and advisory groups.



      (1)   The City Hall administrative staff report to the City
Administrator and it is the City Administrator’s responsibility to direct
and allocate staff time. Similarly, City Council members and board, committee
and commission members schedule their meetings so city staff may be available
to carry out day-to-day business. The City Administrator will assign staff
liaisons to assist boards, committees and commissions as necessary. Boards,
committees and commissions meet regularly and, as a group, present their
issues and concerns to the City Council through reports and recommendations.



      (2)   Advisory groups will consider the recommendations and
proposals of the City Administrator and city staff. If the board, committee
or commission is not in agreement with the recommendations of the city staff,
the City Administrator should describe any difference of opinion in writing
to the City Council. Any differences of opinion may be discussed at the
Council meeting.



   (M)   Removal of members of boards and commissions.  If the Mayor
or the City Council wishes to remove an appointee, they shall follow the
procedures required by state law or city code.



   (N)   Abolishment of a board or commission.  The abolishment or
modification of a board or commission shall be done in accordance with
applicable state law or city code.



(Res. 2017-287, passed 10-9-2017)



§ 35.24  FISCAL MATTERS.



   (A)   The financial plan for the city’s operating revenues and
expenditures plus capital improvements is prepared according to state law and
specific guidelines provided by the City Administrator.



   (B)   Departments develop capital projects deemed necessary
according to requests from the City Council, boards, committees or
commissions, the public, or the departments themselves. Any funds to be spent
by boards, committees or commissions are budgeted in the financial plan of
the department, which works with each respective body. Typically, a board,
committee or commission that oversees operations of a department (such as the
Library Board of Trustees or Water Works) will review and approve its
financial plan before it is submitted to the City Administrator.



   (C)   The City Council will hold work sessions to review and
finalize the entire financial plan. In accordance with state regulations, the
proposed one-year budget is published in the local newspaper in general
circulation, prior to a public hearing. The City Council simultaneously holds
a public hearing on the entire financial plan and one-year budget and adopts
them at the same time. The one-year budget is required by the state and must
be adopted by March 15 of each year.



   (D)   For purchasing procedures for the city, see the city’s
purchasing policy.

§ 35.25  PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS.



   (A)   Generally.



      (1)   One of the goals of the City Council rules is to create
an atmosphere of efficiency, fairness and maximum participation. It is the
responsibility of the Mayor, the Council members, city staff and members of
the public to maintain common courtesy and decorum throughout any meeting.



      (2)   Members of the public have the right to attend City
Council meetings, subject to the need to maintain order and space limitations.



      (3)   The City Council meeting space will, to the extent
possible, be arranged so that all interested persons can observe the meeting
and hear all Council discussions and votes.



      (4)   The Mayor, Council members, city staff and members of
the public should speak one at a time in a civil and courteous manner so as
to be heard by all persons in attendance.



      (5)   All cell phones or other communication devices should be
silenced during City Council meetings. No one should take a voice phone call
during a Council meeting without first leaving the Council chambers and
closing the chamber doors.



   (B)   Public participation.



      (1)   All persons attending are asked to observe the following

multi-unit complex. The owner shall pay a single assessment amount for each
such individual living unit. MULTIPLE-FAMILY UNITS are defined as dwellings
that are designed for occupancy by more than one family or group of
individuals. The number of multiple units shall be measured by the number of
families or individual groups which may be housed in such a structure and not

rely upon current data or the records of the housing and inspection officials
in the city to determine the number of individual family units in any
multiple-family unit complex.

subject to a separate assessment, whether occupied or unoccupied.



(2013 Code, § 28-22)

§ 52.051  DISPOSAL FEE.



   When wastes are disposed of at the city treatment facilities, a
treatment and disposal fee shall be set per unit of volume of hauled waste.
This fee shall be equal to the cost of treatment and disposal.



   (A)   Septage waste. 



      (1)   The fee shall be a minimum charge of $0.118 per gallon
will be placed on all septage wastes collected.



      (2)   All rates are based on and charged for a full truckload
of waste, unless the collection vehicle has a calibrated electronic volume
meter approved by the city’s Water Pollution Control Department. Vehicles
with an electronic volume meter shall either be charged by the gallon shown
on the meter, plus a $10 meter reading fee per load or a full tank load
volume fee.



   (B)   Grease trap wastes. 



      (1)   The fee shall be a minimum charge of $0.135 per gallon
will be placed on all grease trap wastes collected from within the city and
two times the rate or $0.270 per gallon for disposal and treatment of grease
trap wastes collected outside the city.



      (2)   All rates are based on and charged for a full truckload
of waste, unless the collection vehicle has a calibrated electronic volume
meter approved by the city’s Water Pollution Control Department. Vehicles
with an electronic volume meter shall either be charged by the gallon shown
on the meter, plus a $10 meter reading fee per load or a full tank load
volume fee.



      (2)   If grease trap waste is co-mingled with septage, the
full load or metered load will be charged at the higher rate for grease trap
waste.



   (C)   Mudpit facility registration. Any owner of a mudpit wishing to
dispose of the mudpit waste at the city mudpit waste disposal facility shall
pay a registration fee of $100 per calendar year and shall provide cleaning
of the pit at least once per year.



   (D)   Mudpit waste. A minimum charge of $50 per vehicle load will be
placed on all mudpit wastes collected from within the city and an additional
$25 per cubic yard in excess of two yards per vehicle load. Mudpit wastes
shall not be accepted from outside the city limits.



   (E)   Other wastes. The Water Pollution Control Plant Superintendant
may accept other large volumes of trucked waste, if he or she feels the
treatment plant can handle the waste loading. The charge for such waste would
be twice the current rate charged per this chapter or as set by Council
resolution, but at no time less than $0.03 per gallon. The trucked waste
discharger is responsible for all costs associated with the sampling and
testing of the waste as required by the Director.

wastewater system that will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;



      (2)   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal wastewater system that will pass through the system, inadequately
treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;



      (3)   Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim
wastewaters and sludges from the system; and



      (4)   Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the
municipal wastewater system.



   (C)   This subchapter provides for the regulation of direct and
indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance
of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customer’s
capacity will not be preempted and provides for the setting of fees for the
equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established in
this subchapter.



   (D)   This subchapter shall apply to the city and to persons outside
the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the POTW.
Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the Director of the city’s
POTW shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this
subchapter.

substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In
determining whether these are substantially independent factors such as the
extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant and
the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of
activity as the existing source should be considered.



            2.   Construction on a site at which an existing
source is located results in a modification rather than a NEW SOURCE if the
construction does not create a new building, structure, facility or
installation meeting the criteria of divisions (a)1.a. or (a)1.b. above, but
otherwise alters, replaces or adds to existing process or production
equipment.

for the purchase of facilities or equipment that is intended to be used in
its operation within a reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts
which can be terminated or modified without substantial loss and contracts
for feasibility, engineering and design studies do not constitute a
contractual obligation under this definition.



      PASS THROUGH. A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the
United States in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction
with a discharge from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any
requirement of the city’s NPDES permit, including an increase in the
magnitude or duration of a violation.



      PERSON. Any individual, partnership, co-partnership, firm,
company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate,

pollutants, the elimination of pollutants or the alteration of the nature of
pollutants or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater to a less harmful state prior to or in lieu of discharging or
otherwise introducing such pollutants into a POTW. The reduction or
alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or biological processes or
process changes by other means, except as prohibited by 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(d).



      PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS. Any substantive or procedural
requirement related to pretreatment, other than a national pretreatment
standard imposed on an industrial user.



      PUBLICLY-OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW). A treatment works as
defined by § 212 of the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1292) that is owned in this
instance by the city. This definition includes any sewers that convey
wastewater to the POTW treatment plant, but does not include pipes, sewers or
other conveyances not connected to a facility providing treatment. For the
purposes of this subchapter, the acronym POTW shall also include any sewers
that convey wastewaters to the POTW from persons outside the city who are, by
contract or agreement with the city, users of the city’s POTW.



      SHALL. The act referred to is mandatory; MAY is permissive.



      SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USER or MAJOR CONTRIBUTING INDUSTRIES.



         (a)   Applies to the following:



            1.   Industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards; and



            2.   Any other industrial user that:



               a.   Discharges an average of 25,000 gpd or
more of process wastewater;



               b.   Contributes a process waste stream
which makes up 5% or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic
capacity of the treatment plant; or



               c.   Is designated as significant by the
city on the basis that the industrial user has a reasonable potential for
adversely affecting the POTW’s operation or for violating any pretreatment
standard or requirement.



         (b)   The control authority may decide to remove any
non-categorical industrial user from the list of SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS
if the industrial facility has no reasonable potential to violate any
pretreatment standards (general and specific prohibitions or local limits).
The approval authority may choose to review deletions and/or require
additional facilities to be listed.



         (c)   The control authority may reduce oversight of
certain industrial users that may be reclassified as nonsignificant
categorical industrial users (NCSIUs) (40 C.F.R. §§ 403.3(v)(2), 
403.8(f)(2)(v) and 403.12(e)(3)(i)). Previously, all IUs falling under a
federal-listed category were designated as categorical industrial users
(CIUs), no matter the size of the operations. The amendment creates two
additional classifications for CIUs:



            1.   Non-significant CIU: CIUs that consistently
comply with applicable pretreatment standards consistently discharge less
than 100 gpd of categorical wastewater, and never discharge any untreated
concentrated wastewater may be classified as non-significant CIU. This
classification reduces the monitoring requirements for an industry and does
not require that the facility have a pretreatment permit. However, they must
continue to comply with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements
and provide annual certification of compliance.



            2.   Middle tier CIU: CIUs which are:<0.01% of
POTW’s design dry weather hydraulic capacity or 5,000 gpd, whichever is
smaller (measured by continuous effluent flow monitoring) unless the CIU is a
batch discharger; 0.015 of POTW’s design dry weather treatment capacity;
and <0.01% of the maximum allowable headworks loading (MAIL) for any local
limits. To be eligible for classification as a middle tier CIU, the CIU must
not have been in SNC for any time in the previous two years and the daily
flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels cannot vary significantly
whereby reduced reporting would not be representative of operating
conditions. Adoption of these classifications allows for reduced monitoring
and regulatory burden for CIUs with very low flows and potential to impact
the POTW.



      SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE.



         (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits,
defined as those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for
the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any

§ 52.073  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES (SLUG LOADS); PLANS.



   (A)   (1)   Generally. Each user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this subchapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or user’s own
cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures
to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and
shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility and each
user shall verify the status of the slug control plan for any renewal cycle.
No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of
the ordinance from which this subchapter derives shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures
have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this subchapter. If an accidental discharge (slug load)
occurs, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and
notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of
the discharge, the type of waste, the concentration and volume and corrective
actions.



      (2)   Written notice. Within five days following an accidental
discharge, the user shall submit to the Director a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. No such notification shall
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to
person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the use of any fines,
civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this subchapter or
other applicable law.



      (3)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently
posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising
employees whom to call if a slug or accidental discharge occurs. Employers
shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.



(2013 Code, § 28-84)



   (B)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the Director may require
any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug
control plan. At least once every two years, the Director shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs a plan. Any industrial user
required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/control slug plan
shall submit a plan that addresses, at a minimum, the following:



      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including
non-routine batch discharges;



      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;



      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any
accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any
discharge that would violate any of the prohibited discharges in § 52.067 of
this chapter;



      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental
or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants including solvents and/or measures
and equipment for emergency response



      (5)   Industrial users are required to notify the Director
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.

      (5)   Compliance schedules;



      (6)   Requirements for submission of technical reports or
discharge reports (see § 52.077 of this chapter) and including monthly
monitoring reports;



      (7)   Requirements for maintaining and retaining plant records
relating to wastewater discharge as specified by the city and affording city
access thereto. Industrial users must keep records of monitoring activities
and results for a minimum of three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this
subchapter or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the Director and/or approval authority;



      (8)   Requirements for notification of the city of any new
introduction of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the
volume or character of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the
wastewater treatment system;



      (9)   Requirements for notification of slug discharges as per
§ 52.073(A) of this chapter; and



      (10)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to
ensure compliance with this subchapter.



   (E)   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed three years. A permit may be issued for a period less
than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific day. The user shall
apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of
the user’s existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be
subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit as
limitations or requirements, as identified in §§ 52.067 through 52.073 of
this chapter, are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be
informed of any proposed changes in his or her permit at least 30 days prior
to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the
permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.



   (F)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall
not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises or a new or changed operation without the approval of the city. Any
succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of
the existing permit.



   (G)   Report of changed conditions.



      (1)   Each industrial user is required to notify the Director
of any planned significant changes to the industrial user’s operations or
system that might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at
least 30 days before the change in accordance with the following.



         (a)   The Director may require the industrial user to
submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under division (B) above.



         (b)   The Director may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under division (A) above or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit under division (C) above.



      (2)   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed
conditions until and unless the Director has responded to the industrial
user’s notice.



      (3)   For purposes of this division (G), flow increases of 10%
or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be
deemed significant.



(2013 Code, § 28-88)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.077  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEE.



   (A)   General pretreatment regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 403.12 set
forth five basic reporting requirements that apply to industrial users
subject to specific categorical pretreatment standards. Categorical
industrial users must comply with these federal reporting requirements, even
if the control authority has determined that the local limit requirement is
more stringent than the categorical standard. These requirements are as
follows.



      (1)   Baseline monitoring report (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)). A
baseline monitoring report is required, including a compliance schedule, when
necessary, for meeting categorical standards (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(c)). Within
either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment
standard or the final administrative decision on a category determination
under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing significant
industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and
currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be
required to submit to the Director a report which contains the information
listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)1-7. At least 90 days prior to commencement
of their discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall be
required to submit to the Director a report which contains the information
listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)1-7. A new source shall also be required to
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.



      (2)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment
standard deadline (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(d)). Within 90 days following the date
for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case
of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements
shall submit to the Director a report indicating the nature and concentration
of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are
limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and
maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility, which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified
by a qualified professional.



      (3)   Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment
standards. (See § 52.076 of this chapter.) The Director may impose mass
limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by division
(A)(1) above shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the
Director of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in
the applicable pretreatment standards.



      (4)   Periodic report on continued compliance (40 C.F.R. §
403.12(e)). Categorical and non- categorical industrial users are required to
report on their regulated waste discharges to the control authority at least
semiannually. The regulations (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e)(1)) state that the
reports are to contain information indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the effluent that are limited by such categorical pretreatment
standards. For some categorical TTO standards, the categorical regulation
provides for the use of a certification as a substitute for sampling and
analysis results. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured
or estimated average daily flows for the reporting period. If the city
performs all of the monitoring and sampling requirements of the industrial
user’s permit every six months, the city will send all permitted industrial
users a standard six-month compliance form for the industrial user to certify
compliance.



      (5)   Signatory requirements. All wastewater discharge permit
applications and industrial user reports must contain the following
certification statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user: “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance
with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine for knowing violations.”



      (6)   Notice of slug loading (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(f)). (See §
52.073(A) of this chapter.) All industrial users must notify the control
authority immediately of any slug loading. SLUG LOADING is defined as any
pollutant, including biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), released in a discharge
at a flow rate or concentration which will cause interference with the
operation of the treatment works.



      (7)   Notification of discharge of hazardous waste. Any
industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include
the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the
Environmental Protection Agency hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more
than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste
stream discharged during that calendar month; and an estimation of the mass
of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this division (A)(7)
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under § 52.076 of this
chapter. The notification requirement in this division (A)(7) does not apply
to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements.



   (B)   (1)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of
division (A) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.



      (2)   If any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identify
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or list any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the
Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. For any
notification made under this division (B), the industrial user shall certify
that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous
wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.



(2013 Code, § 28-89)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993; Ord. 14970, passed
11-27-2017)



§ 52.078  ANALYSES.



   All analyses required under this subchapter shall be performed in
accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to §
304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments. Where
40 C.F.R. part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for
the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Environmental Protection
Agency publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of
Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments
thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the
Administrator.



(2013 Code, § 28-90)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.079  MONITORING FACILITIES.



   (A)   The city may require an industrial user of the POTW to provide
and operate, at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the user’s premises, but the city may, when such a location
would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility
to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that
landscaping or parked vehicles will not obstruct it.



   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples analysis. The
facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.



   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
city’s requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the city.



(2013 Code, § 28-91)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.080  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.



   (A)   The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this subchapter is being met and all requirements are
being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access
at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination/copying or in the performance of
any of their duties. The city, approval authority and Environmental
Protection Agency shall have the right to set up on the user’s property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance
monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in
force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry
into the premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its
security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the city, approval authority and Environmental Protection
Agency will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities. Sampling of an industrial
user’s wastewater shall be required at least semiannually (once every six
months). The POTW may choose to monitor in lieu of requiring the industrial
user to perform the self-monitoring. If sampling conducted by the industrial
user indicates a violation, the user must repeat the sampling and submit
analytical results within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. If
the industrial user performed the initial sampling, the user must notify the
POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation in addition to
performing the follow-up sampling and analysis. Industrial users that are
identified as “significant” are required to report all monitoring results
to the POTW.



   (B)   In cases of violation where the POTW has assumed
responsibility for sampling in lieu of the industrial user, the POTW must
repeat the sampling and analysis. An exception of that requirement is made if
the POTW performs the sampling at the facility at a frequency of at least
once a month or if the POTW performs sampling at the industrial user between
the time of the initial sampling and the receipt of the results of that
sampling.



   (C)   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow-proportional composited sampling techniques, unless the POTW authorized
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling. Where the POTW
authorizes time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling, the samples
must be representative of the discharge, and the justification for the
decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the IU’s
file for that facility or facilities. When grab samples are determined to be
applicable for representative sampling under certain circumstances, the POTW
shall determine and document the number of grab samples necessary to assess
and assure compliance with applicable limits.



(2013 Code, § 28-92)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993; Ord. 14969, passed
9-25-2017)



§ 52.081  PRETREATMENT.



   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with all federal
categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified
by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review
and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this subchapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation
shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user’s
initiation of the changes.



(2013 Code, § 28-93)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.082  RECORDKEEPING.



   Industrial users shall retain and make available for inspection and
copying all records and information required to be retained under this
subchapter. These records shall remain available for a period of at least
three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of
any litigation concerning compliance with this subchapter or where the
industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period
by the Director and/or approval authority.



(2013 Code, § 28-94)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.083  PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE.



   The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the city, a list of the industrial users which, during the
previous 12 months, were in significant non-compliance with any standard or
requirement of this subchapter. (See § 52.066 of this chapter, defining the
term “significant non-compliance”.)



(2013 Code, § 28-95)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.084  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge
permits and monitoring programs and from city inspection and sampling
activities pursuant to this subchapter shall be available to the public
without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When
requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of the report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 2.302 will
not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.



(2013 Code, § 28-96)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.085  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Emergency suspensions.



      (1)   Under this subchapter, the Director may immediately
suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever
such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director
may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.



      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director shall
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director shall allow the user
to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless
the termination proceedings set forth in division (B) below are initiated
against the user.



      (3)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Director, prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under divisions (B) and (D) below.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section.



   (B)   Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the following
conditions of this subchapter or applicable state and federal regulation is
subject to having his or her permit revoked in accordance with the procedure
of this section:



      (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his or her discharge;



      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in
operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics;



      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises
for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;



      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit;



      (5)   Supplying any false information or statement,
representation or certification in any application, report, plan or other
document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this subchapter; or



      (6)   Violation of any of the provisions and/or requirements
of this subchapter.



   (C)   Notification of violation; compliance scheduling.



      (1)   Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is
violating this subchapter, wastewater contribution permit or any prohibition,
limitation or requirements contained in this subchapter, the water pollution
control plant shall serve upon such person a written notice stating the
nature of the violation. The notification shall require the industry to reply
to the city in writing, within ten days of notification, the cause for the
violation and the action the industry plans to take to achieve compliance. A
notice of violation to an industry in significant non-compliance shall
require the industry to submit a compliance schedule to the city within 30
days of notification. The Director may require a compliance schedule be
required as part of the notice of violation if any single violation warrants
immediate action. Whenever discharge permit renewals or reports are not
submitted as required, a notice of violation shall be issued requiring
submission within seven days of notification.



      (2)   Any industry found in significant non-compliance of its
discharge permit or any single violation of an industrial permit or
pretreatment ordinance provision deemed significant by the Director shall
within 30 days of notification submit to the city a schedule of compliance to
correct the violation. Any plan for corrective action submitted after
notification shall include a timetable for completion of the required tasks.
The plan must be approved and accepted by the city and will represent an
agreement which will allow any available enforcement procedure to apply. Any
schedule of compliance that exceeds 60 days shall be submitted to the
district courts for purposes of a court order approving the compliance
schedule making it enforceable against each party thereto as a court order.



   (D)   Show cause hearing.



      (1)   The city may order any user who causes or allows an
unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the City
Council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be
held by the City Council regarding the violation, the reasons why the action
is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the user to
show cause before the City Council why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days
before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a
corporation.



      (2)   The City Council shall itself conduct the hearing and
take the evidence.



      (3)   After the City Council has reviewed the evidence, it may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that,
following a specified time period, the sewer service will be discontinued. If
the user certifies that proper modifications have been made to meet discharge
requirements, the sewer disconnect order may be cancelled. Further orders and
directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.



   (E)   Legal action. If any person discharges sewage, industrial
wastes or other wastes into the city’s wastewater disposal system contrary
to the provisions of this subchapter, federal or state pretreatment
requirements, or any order of the city, the City Attorney may commence an
action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the District Court of
the county.



(2013 Code, § 28-97)  (Ord. 14438, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 52.999  PENALTY.



   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which
no specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to § 10.999 of this code
of ordinances.



   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of
§§ 52.020 through 52.031 of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be liable
for any damages done to the sanitary sewer system or the water pollution
control plant and shall be punished by a civil penalty as provided in §
10.999(A) of this code of ordinances. Each day that a violation continues may
be considered a separate violation.



(2013 Code, § 28-53)



   (C)   (1)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates or
resists the enforcement of any provision of §§ 52.045 through 52.051 of
this chapter shall be guilty of a municipal infraction, punishable as
provided in § 10.999(A) of this code of ordinances. Each violation
constitutes a separate offense. Any person, firm or corporation who violates
a provision of §§ 52.045 through 52.051 of this chapter after previously
being found guilty of violating the same provision of §§ 52.045 through
52.051 of this chapter at the same location or at a different location shall
be guilty of a repeat offense.



      (2)   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this division
(C) does not preclude the city from seeking alternative relief, including
injunctive relief, suits for monetary damages or enforcement provisions under
the city’s Industrial Pretreatment Ordinance.



(2013 Code, § 28-69)



   (D)   (1)   Judicial enforcement remedies.



         (a)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a
pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions
of §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits
or orders issued under §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of this chapter or any
other pretreatment requirement, the Director may petition the courts through
the city’s Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement
imposed by §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of this chapter on activities of the
industrial user. Such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief may also be sought by the city. A petition for injunctive relief need
not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.



         (b)   Civil penalties. Civil penalties, including
municipal infractions pursuant to city ordinance (see I.C.A. § 364.22), may
be imposed as follows.



            1.   Any industrial user who violates any
pretreatment standard or requirement, as referred to in 40 C.F.R. § 403.8,
may be punished by a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each day a
violation exists or continues.



            2.   Any user who commits any environmental
violation of I.C.A. Ch. 455B or a violation of a standard established by the
city in consultation with the state’s Department of Natural Resources, or
both, may be punished by a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each
occurrence.



            3.   A person committing an environmental
violation is not subject to a civil penalty, if all of the following
conditions are satisfied:



               a.   The violation results solely from the
person conducting an initial startup, cleaning, repairing, performing
scheduled maintenance, testing or conducting a shutdown of either equipment
causing the violation or the equipment designed to reduce or eliminate the
violation;



               b.   The person notifies the city of the
violation within 24 hours from the time that the violation begins; and



               c.   The violation does not continue in
existence for more than eight hours. The city shall not enforce this division
(D)(1)(b) against a person committing an environmental violation until the
city offers to participate in informal negotiations with the person. If the
person accepts the offer, the city and the person shall participate in good
faith negotiations to resolve issues alleged to be the basis of the violation.



            4.   The Director may recover reasonable
attorney’s fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any
actual damages incurred by the city.



            5.   In determining the amount of civil liability,
the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but
not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and
duration, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any
other factor as justice requires.



            6.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not
be a prerequisite for taking any other action against a user.



            7.   Violation of §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of
this chapter shall, in addition hereto, be a municipal infraction.



         (c)   Criminal prosecution. Any person who violates any
provision of §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of this chapter shall, in addition to
the civil penalties in this division (D), upon conviction, be punished by a
penalty as provided in § 10.999 of this code of ordinances.



         (d)   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly
makes any false statement, representation or certification in any
application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be
maintained pursuant to §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of this chapter or the
wastewater contribution permit or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under §§ 52.065
through 52.085 of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a
penalty as provided in § 10.999 of this code of ordinances.



         (e)   Remedies non-exclusive. The provisions in this
section are not exclusive remedies. Additional remedies shall include, but
not be limited to, injunctive relief, suits for monetary damage and suits for
court orders directing compliance. The city reserves the right to take any,
all or any combination of these actions against a non-compliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with
the city’s enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right
to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against any non-compliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.



(2013 Code, § 28-98)



      (2)   Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.



         (a)   Upset. Upset used as an affirmative defense to a
discharge violation under §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of this chapter shall be
in accordance with the following.



            1.   For the purposes of this division (D)(2), the
term UPSET means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and
temporary non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does
not include non-compliance to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities,
lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation.



            2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative
defense to an action brought for non- compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards if the requirements hereof are met.



            3.   An industrial user who wishes to establish
the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:



               a.   An upset occurred and the industrial
user can identify the cause of the upset;



               b.   The facility was at the time being
operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with
applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and



               c.   The industrial user has submitted the
following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24
hours of becoming aware of the upset; if this information is provided orally,
a written submission must be provided within five days:



                  i.   A description of the indirect
discharge and cause of non-compliance;



                  ii.   The period of non-compliance,
including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time
the non-compliance is expected to continue; and



                  iii.   Steps being taken and/or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.



            4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial
user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of
proof.



            5.   Industrial users will have the opportunity
for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement
action brought for non-compliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



            6.   The industrial user shall control production
of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of
treatment is provided. This division (D)(2)(a)6. applies in the situation
where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment
facility is reduced, lost or fails.



         (b)   General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user
shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it
for non-compliance with the general and specific prohibitions in §§ 52.067
and 52.068 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have
reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:



            1.   A local limit exists for each pollutant
discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly
prior to and during the pass through or interference; or



            2.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did
not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior
discharge when the city WPCP was regularly in compliance with its NPDES
permit and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable
sludge use or disposal requirements.



         (c)   Bypass. Bypass used as an affirmative defense to a
discharge violation under §§ 52.065 through 52.085 of this chapter shall be
in accordance with the following:



            1.   For the purpose of this division (B), the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.



               BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste
streams from any portion of a industrial user’s treatment facility.



               SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE
PROPERTY DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



            2.   An industrial user may allow any bypass to
occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be
violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure
efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of
divisions (D)(2)(c)3. and (D)(2)(c)4. below.



            3.   Notice of bypass shall be submitted as
follows.



               a.   If an industrial user knows in advance
of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW at least
ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.



               b.   An industrial user shall submit oral
notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain: a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times; and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent occurrence of the bypass. The
POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report
has been received within 24 hours.



            4.   Enforcement actions and approval of an
anticipated bypass shall be as follows.



               a.   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may
take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:



                  i.   The bypass was unavoidable to
prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage;



                  ii.   There were no feasible
alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment
facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal
periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate
backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods
of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and



                  iii.   The industrial user submitted
notices as required hereunder.



               b.   The POTW may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(2)(c)4.a. above.

§ 53.006  RATE STRUCTURE AND STORM WATER RATE.



   (A)   Any property, lot, parcel of land, building or premises that
is tributary directly or indirectly to the storm water system of the city,
shall be subject to a rate based upon the quantity of impervious area
situated thereon. This charge is not related to the water and/or sewer
service and does not rely on occupancy of the premises to be in effect. All
properties having impervious area of at least 150 square feet within the
corporate limits of the city will be assigned the rate.



   (B)   A unit of impervious surface area on an average single-family,
residential property or equivalent residential unit (ERU) is the quantity
used for assessing storm water charges. One ERU equals 2,800 square feet of
impervious area for the city.



   (C)   The Storm Water Utility charge is calculated based on the
following method.



      (1)   Single-family residential customers and duplexes with
gross property area less or equal to two acres will be assigned one ERU and
assessed a storm water charge that is equivalent to one ERU unit rate per
month.



      (2)   All other developed properties shall be assigned a
number of ERUs based upon the property’s individually measured impervious
area (in square fee) divided by one ERU, or 2,800 square feet, and rounding
up to the nearest integer. The monthly storm water charge assessed to each of
these properties in the number of ERUs times the ERU unit rate.



      (3)   Storm water charges for new residential customers with
gross property area greater than two acres or non-residential developments
shall be based on field measurements of impervious areas.



   (D)   Actual impervious area measurements shall be maintained by the
city’s Engineering Department for all residential customers with parcels
greater than two acres and non-residential customers to determine their share
of the storm water management costs. In no event shall any owner specified
herein pay less than the rate required for one ERU per month. As part of the
building permit process, property owners shall coordinate with the city’s
Building Inspection and Engineering staff to ensure that, as impervious areas
change on the owner’s property due to construction or demolition, the
Engineering Department maintains up to date records of impervious areas for
use in determining property Storm Water Utility billing.



   (E)   Commencing on 7-1-2017, and continuing thereafter, the monthly
unit rate shall be $4 per equivalent residential unit (ERU).



   (F)   The rates shall become effective on July 1 in each year, with
rates being effective upon publication of the ordinance as required by law.

drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets,
catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or human-made,
within the political boundaries of the city which control and/or convey storm
water and through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from
its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for
purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this
system which:



      (1)   Are located within public streets, rights-of-way and
easements;



      (2)   Are subject to easements of rights-of-entry,
rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate
access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and
facilities; or



      (3)   Are located on public lands to which the city has
adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of systems and
facilities. Operation and maintenance of storm water systems and facilities
which are located on private property or public property not owned by the
city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and
facilities for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of the systems and
facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner.



   (B)   It is the intent of this section to protect the public health,
safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not
to create any special duty or relationship with an individual person or to
any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. The city
expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses
in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers,
employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or
relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created.

is found to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such
reasonable time as allowed by the city, the city may enter upon the property
and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the
actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax
levied against the property. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the
authority of this section, for its designated officers and employees to enter
upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon
reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct
surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance.

month late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any Storm
Water Utility service charge that becomes delinquent; or each storm water
service charge rendered under or pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a
lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or premises that
are tributary directly or indirectly to the storm water system of the city
and, if the same is not paid within 60 days of invoice date, it shall be
certified to the County Treasurer, who shall place a lien on said property as
allowed by law and be collected in the same manner as property taxes.



   (D)   (1)   The Storm Water Utility charges in this chapter shall
constitute a lien upon the premises served by the storm water management and

the City Clerk a list of all Storm Water Utility charges that have remained
unpaid and delinquent for a period of 60 days prior to the end of that
quarter, together with the name of the owner and the legal description of the
property or premises for each separate bill, and this list may be certified
to the County Auditor by the City Clerk for collection in the same manner as
taxes, and when so collected the proceeds shall become a part of the Storm
Water Utility Fund of the city.



      (3)   Failure to send or receive a bill for comprehensive
storm water service charge is not a defense to the collection of the service
charges.



   (E)   Suits for collection shall be commenced by the city in the
state’s District Court for the county. No lien shall be imposed for
delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained from a court of
competent jurisdiction. The city may employ any lawful means to collect funds
owed and is not restricted to filing a lawsuit.



   (F)   The Storm Water Utility service charge may be billed on a

enforcement of this chapter shall be recovered from the responsible party.
The Enforcement Officer shall submit an invoice to the responsible party
reflecting the actual costs and wages and expenses incurred by the city for
the enforcement activities undertaken. Failure to pay charges invoiced under
this chapter within 30 days of billing shall constitute a violation of this
chapter.

§ 54.008  SUSPENSION OF ACCESS TO CITY’S STORM SEWER SYSTEM.



   (A)   Emergency suspension. The Enforcement Officer may, without
prior notice, suspend storm sewer system access to a property when such
emergency suspension is necessary to stop an ongoing or imminent illicit
discharge. If the responsible party fails to immediately comply with an
emergency suspension order, the Enforcement Officer shall take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize the illicit discharge. All costs of
such action shall be recovered from the responsible party for the property
identified as the source of the illicit discharge.



   (B)   Non-emergency suspension. If the Enforcement Officer detects
or is informed of circumstances which could cause an illicit discharge, but
such illicit discharge is not ongoing or imminent, and if the suspension of
storm sewer system access would reasonably be expected to prevent or reduce
the potential illicit discharge, the Enforcement Officer shall notify the
responsible party of the proposed suspension of storm sewer system access and
the time and date of such suspension. Notice to one responsible party for the
property shall be sufficient notice to all. Remediation of the circumstances
shall avoid a violation of this chapter; provided that, no illicit discharge
occurs. In the alternative, the responsible party may request a meeting with
the Enforcement Officer for the purpose of presenting information which the
responsible party believes will show that remediation is unnecessary and, if
the Enforcement Officer finds such information is satisfactory, the
Enforcement Officer may rescind or modify the notice of suspension. If the
Enforcement Officer finds such information unsatisfactory, the Enforcement
Officer shall issue a final written order of suspension including the date
and time of suspension and such order may be appealed as provided in this
chapter. Any physical action to reinstate storm sewer system access to
property subject to such order prior to obtaining a court order of relief
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. An order of suspension shall not
preclude charging the responsible party with a municipal infraction as
provided hereinafter or taking any other enforcement action permitted by law.

such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property below the elevation of the 100-year flood free of trash,
debris, grass clippings or other organic wastes and other obstacles that
would pollute, contaminate or significantly alter the quality or quantity of
water flowing through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function or physical integrity of the watercourse.

defined herein; and



         (f)   Shall include within the SWPPP a signed and dated
certification by the person preparing the SWPPP that the SWPPP complies with
all requirements of this section.



      (2)   The SWPPP shall be modified by a design professional (as
defined herein) as required in General Permit No. 2. Any modification of a
SWPPP shall meet the requirements above.



(2013 Code, § 28-167)



   (C)   (1)   The applicant shall submit a SWPPP for the site,
meeting the requirements established in the Design Standards Manual, to the
City Engineer for review and approval, as follows.

ownership changes, the Enforcement Officer must be notified of the title
transfer within 30 days, except in the case of single-lot sales, which shall
be recorded on the SWPPP. The new owner shall be subject to all terms and
conditions of the erosion control permit. A copy of the notice of transfer
that was sent to the Enforcement Officer shall be included in the SWPPP. For
sites that are part of a larger common plan of development such as a housing
or commercial development project, if a permittee transfers ownership of all
or any part of property subject to an erosion control permit, both the
permittee and transferee shall be responsible for compliance with the
provisions of General Permit No. 2 and the erosion control permit for that
portion of the project which as been transferred including when the
transferred property is less than one acre in area. If the new owner agrees
in writing to be solely responsible for compliance with the provisions of
General Permit No. 2 and the erosion control permit for the property which
has been transferred, then the existing permittee shall be relieved of
responsibility for compliance with General Permit No. 2 and the erosion
control permit for the transferred property, from and after the date the
transfer of responsibility is attached to the SWPPP.

§ 56.001  TITLE.



   This chapter shall be known as the “Marshalltown Post-Construction
Storm Water Management Ordinance” and may be cited as such and will be
referred to herein as “this chapter”.

§ 56.002  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit program administered by the state’s Department of
Natural Resources (IDNR) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of storm water from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4)
(MS4 permit). The city is subject to the program and is required to obtain,
and has obtained, an MS4 permit. The city’s MS4 permit is on file at the
office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection during
regular office hours.



   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to comply with the MS4 permit
requirements and establish a set of water quality and quantity policies
applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the
regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation. The regulation of storm water runoff discharged
from land development and other construction activities in order to control
and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion,
stream channel erosion and non-point source pollution associated with storm
water runoff, is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public
health and safety.

the property owner or representative of the owner.



   (B)   The city may conduct site visits at any time to determine
compliance with the approved Post-Construction Storm Water Management Plan
(PCSWMP). Additionally, the city may request that a property owner verify,
through the preparation of an as-built plan completed by a state licensed
professional engineer or landscape architect, that the PCSWMP facilities
contain appropriate capacities and operational characteristics as originally
designed and approved.



   (C)   In the event that a site is found not to be in compliance with
the PCSWMP, the city will communicate in writing, with the property owner a

probably cause to impound the vehicle in question. The Hearing Officer shall
decide only that either there was probably cause to impound the vehicle and
contents, or there was no probable cause to impound the vehicle and contents.
If the Hearing Officer determines there was probable cause to impound the
vehicle and contents, the registered owner or person having legal entitlement
to possession of the vehicle is responsible for payment of all charges
attributable to the impoundment and storage of the vehicle and the costs of
the administrative hearing. If the Hearing Officer determines there was no
probable cause, the Hearing Officer shall prepare a certificate of no
probable cause and the bond filed or charges paid shall be refunded pursuant
to § 72.072 of this chapter.

recorded by the Hearing Officer. Such tape recording shall serve as the

Hearing Officer shall retain all such tape recordings until the time for
filing a notice of appeal has expired. If a notice of appeal is timely filed,
the Hearing Officer shall retain the tape-recorded record of the
administrative hearing until the appeal has been acted upon by the City
Council.



   (C)   The decision of the Hearing Officer shall in no way affect any
criminal proceeding in connection with the impoundment in question.



   (D)   Criminal charges, if any, may only be challenged in the
appropriate court.

complaint hereunder, it is determined that a person is keeping, sheltering or
harboring a vicious animal in the city which has not been licensed as a
vicious animal under this chapter, or which has been found to be at large
after being deemed vicious, the Police Chief, or his or her designee, or the
Animal Warden, shall order the person keeping, sheltering or harboring the
vicious animal within three days of service of the order to either safely and
permanently place the animal with an organization or group determined by the
Animal Warden to be safe to keep vicious animals or destroy the animal. The
order herein shall be contained in a written notice directed to the person or
persons keeping, sheltering or harboring the vicious animal and shall be
served in the manner of personal service under the Iowa Rules of Civil
Procedure, or by both regular and certified mail and shall be effective upon
placement of the notice in a United States Post Office receptacle. The notice
shall also advise the persons to whom it is directed of their right to appeal
the order by delivering to the City Clerk within three days of the personal
service or five days of the mailing by regular and certified mail, a written
notice of appeal which provides the names and addresses of the owners of the
vicious animal, names the vicious animal and states the grounds upon which
the appeal is based. Within seven days of receiving a notice of appeal
hereunder, the City Clerk shall send by regular mail  to the appellant(s) at
the address provided in the notice of appeal, a written notice of the time,
date and place for the hearing, the name of the Hearing Officer appointed by
the City Administrator to conduct the appeal and the rights of the appellants

Ordinance”.

§ 94.002  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. A plan whereby a set of specific, result-oriented
procedures is established and to which a person commits itself to apply every
good faith effort to achieve. The objective of those procedures is to ensure
equal opportunity in public and private employment, housing, public
accommodation, credit transactions and city contracts.



   BONA FIDE OCCUPATIONAL QUALIFICATION (BFOQ). Discrimination on a
prohibited basis is lawful only if it results from a bona fide occupational
qualification essential to the normal operation of the employer’s business
or enterprise. The BFOQ EXCEPTION will be interpreted narrowly, and the
burden of proving that a prohibited basis is a BFOQ rests upon the party
seeking to rely upon the exception. Customer or employer preference or
historical usage, tradition or custom or stereotyped characterizations will
not merit the exception.



   COMMISSION. The city’s Human Rights Commission.

   COURT. The District Court in and for the county, or any judge or
magistrate of such court if the court is not in session at that time.



   DISABILITY. The physical or mental condition of a person which
constitutes a substantial disability, and the condition of a person with a
positive human immunodeficiency virus test result, a diagnosis of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, a diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome-related complex or any other condition related to acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. The inclusion of a condition related to a positive human
immunodeficiency virus test result in the meaning of DISABILITY under the
provisions of this chapter does not preclude the application of the
provisions of this chapter to conditions resulting from other contagious or
infectious diseases.



   EMPLOYEE. Any person employed by an employer.



   EMPLOYER. The city, or any board, commission, department or agency

corporations, legal representatives, trustees, receivers and the city or any
board, commission, department or agency thereof.

UNFAIR PRACTICES




§ 94.035  UNFAIR PRACTICES IN ACCOMMODATIONS AND SERVICES; EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)   It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any
owner, lessee, sublessee, proprietor, manager or superintendent of any public
accommodation or any agent or employee thereof to:



      (1)   Refuse or deny to any person because of race, creed,

accommodations, advantages, facilities, services or privileges thereof or
otherwise discriminate against any person because of race, creed, color, sex,

      (2)   Advertise, directly or indirectly, or in any other
manner indicate or publicize that the patronage of persons of any particular
race, creed, color, sex, national origin, religion, marital status or
disability is unwelcome, objectionable, not acceptable or not solicited.



   (B)   The provisions of division (A) above shall not apply to the
following:



      (1)   Any bona fide religious institution with respect to any
qualifications the institution may impose based on religion when such

(2013 Code, § 16-21)  (Ord. 14175, passed 2-13-1984)  Penalty, see §
10.999



§ 94.036  UNFAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES; EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)   It shall be unfair or discriminatory practice for any:



      (1)   Person to refuse to hire, accept, register, classify or
refer for employment; to discharge any employee; or to otherwise discriminate
in employment against any applicant for employment or any employee because of
the age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin, marital status or
disability of such applicant or employee, unless based upon the nature of the
occupation. If a person with a disability is qualified to perform a
particular occupation by reason of training or experience, the nature of that
occupation shall not be the basis for exception to the unfair or
discriminating practices prohibited by this division (A);



      (2)   Labor organization or the employees, agents or members
thereof to refuse to admit to membership any applicant, to expel any member
or to otherwise discriminate against any applicant for membership, or any
member in the privileges, rights or benefits of such membership because of
the age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin, religion, marital status
or disability of such applicant or member;



      (3)   Employer, employment agency, labor organization or the
employees, agents or members thereof to directly or indirectly advertise or
in any other manner indicate or publicize that individuals of any particular
age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin, religion, marital status or
disability are unwelcome, objectionable, not acceptable, or not solicited for
employment or membership, unless based upon the nature of the occupation. If
a person with a disability is qualified to perform a particular occupation by
reason of training or experience, the nature of that occupation shall not be
the basis for exception to the unfair or discriminating practices prohibited
by this subsection. An employer, employment agency or their employees,
servants or agents may offer employment or advertise for employment to only
persons with disabilities when other applicants have available to them other
employment compatible with their ability which would not be available to
persons with disabilities because of their disabilities. Any such employment
or offer of employment shall not discriminate among persons with disabilities
on the basis of race, color, creed, sex or national origin; and



      (4)   Person to solicit or require as a condition of
employment of any employee or prospective employee a test for the presence of
the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus or to affect the terms,
conditions or privileges of employment or terminate the employment of any
employee solely as a result of the employee obtaining a test for the presence
of the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus. An agreement between an
employer, employment agency, labor organization or their employees, agents or
members and an employee or prospective employee concerning employment, pay or
benefits to an employee or prospective employee in return for taking a test
for the presence of the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus is
prohibited. The prohibitions of this division (A)(4) do not apply if the
state’s Epidemiologist determines and the Director of Public Health
declares through the utilization of guidelines established by the Centers for
Disease Control of the United States Department of Health and Human Services
that a person with a condition related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome
poses a significant risk of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus
to other persons in a specific occupation.



   (B)   Employment policies relating to pregnancy and childbirth shall
be governed by the following:



      (1)   A written or unwritten employment policy or practice
that excludes from employment an applicant or employee because of the
employee’s pregnancy is a prima facie violation of this chapter;



      (2)   Disabilities caused or contributed to by the
employee’s pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom are,
for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as
such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan
available in connection with employment. Written and unwritten employment
policies and practices involving matters such as the commencement and
duration of leave, the availability of extensions, the accrual of seniority
and other benefits and privileges, reinstatement and payment under any health
or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan, formal or informal,
shall be applied to a disability due to the employee’s pregnancy or giving
birth, on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other
temporary disabilities;



      (3)   Disabilities caused or contributed to by legal abortion
and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary
disabilities and shall be treated as such under any temporary disability or
sick leave plan available in connection with employment. Written and
unwritten employment policies and practices involving matters such as the
commencement and duration of leave, the availability of extensions, the
accrual of seniority and other benefits and privileges, reinstatement and
payment under any temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan, formal
or informal, shall be applied to a disability due to legal abortion on the
same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary
disabilities. The employer may elect to exclude health insurance coverage for
abortion from a plan provided by the employer, except where the life of the
mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or where medical
complications have arisen from an abortion;



      (4)   An employer shall not terminate the employment of a
person disabled by pregnancy because of the employee’s pregnancy; and



      (5)   (a)   Where a leave is not available or a sufficient
leave is not available under any health or temporary disability insurance or
sick leave plan available in connection with employment, the employer of the
pregnant employee shall not refuse to grant to the employee who is disabled
by the pregnancy a leave of absence if the leave of absence is for the period
that the employee is disabled because of the employee’s pregnancy,
childbirth or related medical conditions, or for eight weeks, whichever is
less. However, the employee must provide timely notice of the period of leave
requested, and the employer must approve any change in the period requested
before the change is effective.



         (b)   Before granting the leave of absence, the employer
may require that the employee’s disability resulting from pregnancy be
verified by medical certification stating that the employee is not able to
reasonably perform the duties of employment.



   (C)   (1)   This section shall not prohibit discrimination on the
basis of age if the person subject to the discrimination is under the age of
18 years, unless that person is considered by law to be an adult.



      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a state
or federal program designed to benefit a specific age classification that
serves a bona fide public purpose shall be permissible.



      (3)   This section shall not apply to age discrimination in
bona fide apprenticeship employment programs if the employee is over 45 years
of age.



   (D)   Division (A) above shall not apply to the following:



      (1)   Any employer who regularly employs less than four
individuals. For purposes of this division (D), individuals who are members
of the employer’s family shall not be counted as employees;



      (2)   The employment of individuals for work within the home
of the employer if the employer or members of his or her family reside
therein during such employment;



      (3)   The employment of individuals to render personal service
to the person of the employer or members of his or her family; and



      (4)   (a)   Any bona fide religious institution or its
educational facility, association, corporation or society with respect to any
qualifications for employment based on religion when such qualifications are
related to a bona fide religious purpose.



         (b)   A religious qualification for instructional
personnel or an administrative officer, serving in a supervisory capacity of
a bona fide religious educational facility or religious institution, shall be
presumed to be a bona fide occupational qualification.



   (E)   After a handicapped individual is employed, the employer shall
not be required under this chapter to promote or transfer such handicapped
person to another job or occupation. Any collective bargaining agreement
between an employer and labor organization shall contain this section as a
part of such agreement.



(2013 Code, § 16-22)  (Ord. 14175, passed 2-13-1984)  Penalty, see §
10.999

auctioneers, agents or representatives by power of attorney or appointment,

         (a)   Refuse to sell, rent, lease, assign, sublease,

person because of the race, color, sex, creed, religion, national origin,
marital status, disability or familial status of such person;



         (b)   Discriminate against any person because of the
person’s race, color, sex, creed, religion, national origin, marital
status, disability or familial status in the terms, conditions or privileges
of the sale, rental, lease, assignment or sublease of any real property or
housing accommodation or any part, portion or interest in the real property
of housing accommodation or in the provision of services or facilities in
connection with the real property or housing accommodation. For purposes of
this division (A)(1)(b), the term PERSON means one or more individuals,
corporations, partnerships, associations, labor organizations, legal
representatives, mutual companies, joint stock companies, trusts,
unincorporated organizations, trustees, trustees in cases under U.S.C. Title
11, receivers and fiduciaries;



         (c)   Advertise, directly or indirectly, or in any other
manner indicate or publicize that the purchase, rental, lease, assignment or

guests, visitors, relatives or in any similar capacity.

person to sell or rent a dwelling by representations regarding the entry or
prospective entry into a neighborhood of a person of a particular race,
color, creed, sex, religion, national origin, disability or familial status.



      (3)   A person shall not represent to a person of a particular
race, color, creed, sex, religion, national origin, disability or familial
status that a dwelling is not available for inspection, sale or rental when

      (5)   A person shall not discriminate against another person
in the terms, conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling or in

because of a disability of any of the following persons:



         (a)   The person;

DISCRIMINATION includes any of the following circumstances:



         (a)   A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person
with a disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or
to be occupied by the person if the modifications are necessary to afford the

condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear
excepted;



         (b)   A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in

         (c)   In connection with the design and construction of
covered multi-family dwellings for first occupancy after 1-1-1992, a failure
to design and construct those dwellings in a manner that meets the following
requirements:

dwellings are readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities;



            2.   All doors designed to allow passage into and
within all premises within the dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow
passage by persons with disabilities in wheelchairs; and

following features of adaptive design:



               a.   An accessible route into and through
the dwelling;



               b.   Light switches, electrical outlets,

               c.   Reinforcements in bathroom walls to
allow later installation of grab bars; and



               d.   Usable kitchens and bathrooms so that a
person in a wheelchair can maneuver about the space.



         (d)   Compliance with the appropriate requirements of
the American National Standard for buildings and facilities providing

“ANSI A 117.1”, satisfies the requirements of division (A)(6)(c) above.



      (7)   Nothing in this division (A) requires that a dwelling be
made available to a person whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to
the health or safety of other persons or whose tenancy would result in
substantial physical damage to the property of others.



      (8)   A person whose business includes engaging in residential
real estate related transactions shall not discriminate against a person in

financial assistance to purchase, construct, improve, repair or maintain a
dwelling, or to secure residential real estate; and/or



         (b)   To sell, broker or appraise residential real
estate.



      (9)   A person shall not deny another person access to, or
membership or participation in a multiple-listing service, real estate
brokers’ organization or other service, organization or facility relating
to the business of selling or renting dwellings, or discriminate against a
person in terms or conditions of access, membership or participation in such
organization because of race, color, creed, sex, religion, national origin,
disability or familial status.



   (B)   Division (A) above shall not apply to the following:



      (1)   Any bona fide religious institution with respect to any
qualifications it may impose based on religion, when such qualifications are
related to a bona fide religious purpose;

§ 94.038  AIDING OR ABETTING UNFAIR PRACTICES.



   It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any person to:



   (A)   Intentionally aid, abet, compel or coerce another person to
engage in any of the practices declared unfair or discriminatory by this
chapter; or



   (B)   Discriminate against another person in any of the rights
protected against discrimination by this chapter because such person has
lawfully opposed any practice forbidden under this chapter; obeys the
provisions of this chapter; or has filed a complaint, testified or assisted
in any proceeding under this chapter. An employer, employment agency or their
employees or servants may offer employment or advertise for employment to
only a person with disability, when other applicants have available to them
other employment compatible with their ability which would not be available
to a person with a disability because of their disability. Any such
employment or offer of employment shall not discriminate among the disabled
on the basis of race, color, creed, sex or national origin.

§ 94.039  UNFAIR CREDIT PRACTICES.



   (A)   It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for any:



      (1)   Creditor to refuse to enter into a consumer credit
transaction or impose finance charges or other terms or conditions more
onerous than those regularly extended by that creditor to consumers of
similar economic backgrounds because of age, color, creed, national origin,
race, religion, marital status, sex, physical disability or familial status;



      (2)   Person authorized or licensed to do business in this
state pursuant to I.C.A. Ch. 524, 533, 534, 536 or 536A to refuse to loan or
extend credit or to impose terms or conditions more onerous than those
regularly extended to persons of similar economic backgrounds because of age,
color, creed, national origin, race, religion, marital status, sex, physical
disability or familial status; and/or



      (3)   Creditor to refuse to offer credit life or health and
accident insurance because of color, creed, national origin, race, religion,
marital status, age, physical disability, sex or familial status. Refusal by
a creditor to offer credit life or health and accident insurance based upon
the age or physical disability of the consumer shall not be an unfair or
discriminatory practice if such denial is based solely upon bona fide
underwriting considerations not prohibited hereby.



   (B)   The provisions of this section shall not be construed by
negative implication or otherwise to narrow or restrict any other provisions
of this chapter.

§ 94.040  SEX OR AGE PROVISIONS INAPPLICABLE TO RETIREMENT PLANS.



   (A)   The provisions of this chapter relating to discrimination
because of sex or age shall not be construed to apply to any retirement plan
or benefit system of any employer unless such plan or system is a mere
subterfuge adopted for the purpose of evading the provisions of this chapter.
However, a retirement plan or benefit system shall not require the
involuntary retirement of a person under the age of 70 because of that
person’s age. This division (A) does not prohibit the involuntary
retirement of a person who has attained the age of 65 and has for the two
prior years been employed in a bona fide executive or high policy-making
position and who is entitled to an immediate, non-forfeitable annual
retirement benefit from a pension, profit-sharing savings or deferred
compensation plan of the employer which equals $27,000. This retirement
benefit test may be adjusted according to the regulations prescribed by the
United States Secretary of Labor, pursuant to Pub. Law No. 95-256, § 3.



   (B)   A health insurance program provided by an employer may exclude
coverage of abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered
if the fetus were carried to term or where medical complications have arisen
from an abortion.



   (C)   An employee welfare plan may provide life, disability or
health insurance benefits that vary by age based on actuarial differences if
the employer contributes equally for all the participating employees or may
provide for employer contributions differing by age if the benefits for all
the participating employees do not vary by age.

   It shall be unfair or discriminatory practice for any person to
discharge, harass, penalize or otherwise retaliate against an individual
because of that individual’s attempts to secure compliance with this
chapter of the remedies provided herein. It shall be an unfair or
discriminatory practice for any person to discharge, harass, penalize or
otherwise retaliate with respect to employment, housing, public
accommodations or financial practices against any individual because of that
individual’s association with persons of a particular race, religion,
creed, national origin, marital status or sex.

   (A)   Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a discriminatory or
unfair practice within the city may, by himself or herself or his or her
attorney, make, sign and file a verified written charge of discriminatory
practice. The Human Rights Commission, a member of the Commission, the City
Attorney, the State Civil Rights Commission, any place of public
accommodation, employer, labor organization or other person who has any
employees or members who refuse or threaten to refuse to comply with the
provisions of this chapter may in like manner make, sign and file such charge.



   (B)   A verified copy of a complaint filed with the state’s Civil
Rights Commission, as provided by state law, shall be a sufficient charge for
the purpose of this subchapter, if it alleges either in the text thereof or
in accompanying statements that the alleged discriminatory practices occurred
within the city.



   (C)   Charges may be filed with the Commission Chairperson, the
Director or the Secretary of the Commission.



   (D)   Any complaint filed under this chapter shall be filed within
180 days after the most recent act constituting the alleged discriminatory or
unfair practice.

   (A)   Within five days after the filing of a charge under this
subchapter, the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission or, in his or her
absence or failure to act, the Vice-Chairperson or other member designated by
the Commission shall designate an investigating committee of three, composed
of one Commissioner and two other qualified persons, who may be from the
Commission staff. The vote of the majority of the investigating committee
shall determine all questions coming within its function.



   (B)   The investigating committee shall first determine whether
probable cause exists to believe that the person charged in the complaint has
committed an unfair or discriminatory practice within the meaning of this
chapter. It shall take the sworn testimony of the complainant and such other
evidence as it deems relevant, and the Chairperson of the investigating
committee shall have authority to administer the oath to witnesses.

   (A)   If the investigating committee shall find no probable cause to
believe that the person charged has committed an unfair or discriminatory
practice, it shall report the finding to the Human Rights Commission and
shall notify the complainant in writing by registered or certified mail.



   (B)   If the complainant fails to object to such findings within ten
days after delivery of such written notice, the Commission shall close the
case. The Secretary of the Commission shall report such fact to the state’s
Civil Rights Commission.



   (C)   If the complainant objects in writing to such findings within
ten days after delivery of such written notice, the Commission shall hear his
or her evidence in an executive session. If the Commission finds no probable
cause to believe that the person charged has committed an unfair or
discriminatory practice, it shall declare the case closed. If the Commission
finds probable cause to exist, it shall take further proceedings as are
provided.

   (A)   If the investigating committee shall find probable cause to
believe that the person charged has committed an unfair or discriminatory
practice, it shall report the finding to the Human Rights Commission.



   (B)   If the Commission shall find, on the report of the
investigating committee or on its own investigation, probable cause to
believe that the person charged has committed an unfair or discriminatory
practice as defined by this chapter, it shall direct an appropriate person to
attempt to conciliate the matter, and it shall issue and cause to be served
upon such person charged a notice stating the charges against such person and
requesting the cooperation of the person charged in conciliation. Service of
the notice may be by registered or certified mail or by any means provided
for the service of original notices in civil actions.



   (C)   The Commission shall notify the state’s Civil Rights
Commission whenever a finding of probable cause or no probable cause has been
made with respect to any case within its jurisdiction or whenever such case
is otherwise closed.

to notify the state’s Civil Rights Commission of any matter, it shall be
the duty of the Secretary of the Commission to transmit such notice or
information in writing within five days after the event giving rise to the
duty to give notice or information.



   (E)   All filing on charges, complaints or hearings may be filed and
held as provided by the state’s Civil Rights Act of 1965, as amended,

§ 94.059  CONCILIATION PROCEEDINGS.



   (A)   If the person directed to conciliate under provisions of this
chapter succeeds in conciliation, the person shall report to the Human Rights
Commission and shall submit a proposed written conciliation agreement. The
conciliation agreement shall be effective only if approved by the person
charged and by the Commission. The complainant shall have an opportunity to
be heard as to the terms of the conciliation agreement, but the Commission
may act without his or her approval.



   (B)   If the Commission accepts the conciliation agreement, it shall
close the case, subject to whatever continuing supervision of the charged
party is provided in the agreement, and shall communicate the terms of the
agreement to the state’s Civil Rights Commission.



   (C)   If the Commission rejects the conciliation agreement, it may
either direct that further attempts at conciliation be made or it may file
its complaint of the discriminatory practice charged and proceed as provided.
It shall notify the state’s Civil Rights Commission of the rejection of the
proposed agreement and of the action taken.

   If, after attempts to conciliate as provided in this subchapter, the
person directed to conciliate shall find that the person is unable to
conciliate the matter, the person shall report the finding in writing to the
Human Rights Commission. If the Commission determines the charge to be well
founded, it may then file its complaint of the discriminatory practice
charged. If the Commission determines the charge not to be well founded, it
shall declare the case closed and shall so notify the parties. In either
event, the Commission or its Director shall notify the state’s Civil Rights
Commission of the failure of conciliation efforts and of the action taken.

   (A)   Upon filing the complaint as provided in this subchapter, the
Human Rights Commission shall issue and cause to be served on the person
charged a notice, containing a copy of the complaint and stating the time and
place of hearing on the complaint. The hearing shall be held not less than
ten days after the issuance of the notice, in a building open to the public

witnesses who appear.



   (C)   The Commission shall have the power to reasonably and fairly
amend the complaint, and the party charged shall have the power to reasonably
and fairly amend his or her answer at any time before a final order is
entered in the case.



   (D)   The City Attorney or an attorney designated by him or her
shall conduct the case on behalf of the Commission. If the City Attorney is
unable to conduct the case because of conflict of interest or otherwise, the
City Council may appoint a special attorney to conduct the case on behalf of
the Commission. The complainant may introduce further evidence to support the
claims alleged in his or her charge, either in person or by attorney. No
member of the investigating committee shall participate in the deliberations
of the Commission on the case, except as a witness.



   (E)   If the person charged shall fail to file an answer to the
complaint or shall fail to appear in person or by attorney at the hearing,
the Commission shall proceed to consider the testimony offered and shall base
its decision thereon.



   (F)   The evidence shall be taken under oath and the Commission
Chairperson, or other member of the Commission, acting as presiding officer
in the conduct of such public hearing is authorized to administer the oath to
witnesses. The Commission shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence
prevailing in courts of law or equity, but the rights of cross-examination
shall be preserved.

   (A)   If, upon the preponderance of the testimony taken, the Human
Rights Commission shall be of the opinion that any person charged in the
complaint filed under this subchapter has engaged in or is engaging in the
unfair or discriminatory practice complained of, the Commission shall state
its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an
order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair or
discriminatory practice and to take such affirmative action, including, but
not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or
without back pay; the referring of applicants for employment by any
respondent employment agency; the admittance or restoration to membership by
any respondent labor organization; the admission to or continuation in
enrollment in an apprenticeship program, on-the-job training program; the
posting of notices; the reinstatement of any offer to sell, rent or lease
property; the placing of the complainant on a waiting list as of the date of
the unfair or discriminatory practice complained of; and to show property
being offered for sale, rental or lease, as is required to remedy the unfair
or discriminatory practice complained of.



   (B)   If, on the preponderance of the testimony taken, the
Commission shall find that the person charged in the complaint has not
engaged in the unfair or discriminatory practice complained of, the
Commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be
served on the complainant and on the party charged an order dismissing the
complaint.

§ 94.063  JUDICIAL REVIEW.



   (A)   Any complainant or respondent claiming to be aggrieved by a
final order of the Human Rights Commission made under this subchapter,
including a refusal to issue an order, may obtain judicial review thereof,
and the Commission may obtain an order of court for the enforcement of
Commission orders in a proceeding as provided in this section.



   (B)   An enforcement proceeding brought by the Commission shall be
brought in the District Court in the county in which the alleged
discriminatory or unfair practice which is the subject of the Commission’s
order was committed, or the county in which any respondent required in the
order to cease or desist from a discriminatory or unfair practice or to take
other affirmative action resides or transacts business.



   (C)   Such an enforcement proceeding shall be initiated by the
filing of a petition in such Court and the service of a copy thereof upon the
respondent. Thereupon, the Commission shall file with the Court a transcript
of the record of the hearing before it. The Court shall have the power to
grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper,
and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth
in such transcript an order enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so
modified, or setting aside the order of the Commission, in whole or in part.



   (D)   An objection that has not been urged before the Commission
shall not be considered by the Court in an enforcement proceeding, unless the
failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of
extraordinary circumstances.



   (E)   If no proceeding to obtain judicial review is instituted
within 30 days from the service of an order of the Commission under this
section, the Commission may obtain an order of the Court for the enforcement
of such order upon showing that respondent is subject to the jurisdiction of
the Commission and resides or transacts business within the county in which
the petition for enforcement is brought.



   (F)   An aggrieved party of record may obtain judicial review by
filing a petition for judicial review in county’s District Court, within 30
days after the Commission has issued or refused to issue a final order.



   (G)   (1)   The petition shall name the Commission as a
respondent and shall contain a concise statement of the following:



         (a)   The nature of the Commission action that is the
subject of the petition;



         (b)   The particular action appealed from;



         (c)   The grounds on which relief is sought; and



         (d)   The relief sought.



      (2)   Service of the petition shall be made as required in
I.C.A. § 17A.19.



   (H)   Where a party files a petition for judicial review, the
Commission shall file with the Court a transcript of the record of the
hearing before it.



   (I)   The court shall not itself hear further evidence with respect
to issues of fact; however, the Court may remand the case to the Commission
for the taking of further evidence upon application by any party, a showing
of materiality and that there was good cause for failing to present such
evidence before the Commission in the original proceeding. The Commission may
modify its findings and decision by reason of additional evidence and shall
file that evidence and any modifications, new findings or decision with the
court and mail copies to all parties.



   (J)   The court may affirm the Commission’s action or remand to
the Commission for further proceedings. The court shall reverse, modify or
grant any other appropriate relief if substantial rights of the petitioner
have been prejudiced because the Commission action is:



      (1)   In violation of constitutional, or statutory law, or the
provisions of this chapter;



      (2)   In excess of the Commission’s authority;



      (3)   In violation of any Commission rule;



      (4)   Unsupported by substantial evidence;



      (5)   Unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious or an abuse of
discretion; or



      (6)   Affected by any other error of law.



   (K)   Appeal from the District Court may be taken as in other civil
cases, although the appeal may be taken regardless of the amount involved.

   (A)   A person claiming to be aggrieved by an unfair or
discriminatory practice must initially seek an administrative relief by
filing a complaint with the Human Rights Commission in accordance with this
chapter. A complainant, after the proper filing of a complaint with the
Commission, may subsequently commence an action for relief in the District
Court if all of the following conditions have been satisfied:



      (1)   The complainant has timely filed the complaint with the
Commission as provided in this chapter; and



      (2)   The complaint has been on file with the Commission for
at least 120 days and the Commission has issued a release to the complainant
pursuant to division (B) below.



   (B)   Upon a request by the complainant, and after the expiration of
120 days from the timely filing of a complaint with the Commission, the
Commission shall issue to the complainant a release stating that the
complainant has a right to commence an action in the District Court. A
release under this division (B) shall not be issued if a finding of no
probable cause has been made on the complaint or a conciliation agreement has
been executed or the Commission has served notice of hearing upon the
respondent pursuant to this chapter or the complaint is closed as an
administrative closure and two years have elapsed since the issuance date of
the closure.



   (C)   An action authorized under this section is barred unless
commenced within 90 days after issuance by the Commission of a release under
division (B) above or within one year after the filing of the complaint,
whichever occurs first. If a complainant obtains a release from the
Commission under division (B) above, the Commission shall be barred from
further action on that complaint.

license holder either personally or by ordinary mail addressed to the last
known address of the permit or license holder with sufficient postage

calls to the location of a party, gathering or event in order to disperse
uncooperative participants, which constitutes a drain of manpower and
resources, often depriving other areas of the city of necessary levels of
police protection.

safety of the police officers and to the public in general and constitutes a
public nuisance.

harmful to the health, safety and welfare of the community and imposing both

exceed ten years. The grantor shall award a non-exclusive franchise to
construct, erect, operate and maintain in, upon, along, across, above, over
and under the streets, alleys, public ways and public places laid out or
dedicated and all extensions thereof and additions thereto in the city poles,

§ 114.045  UNDERGROUND AND ABOVEGROUND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Pole agreements. Under this chapter, the grantee may lease,
rent or in any other manner by mutual agreement obtain the use of towers,
poles, lines, cables and other equipment and facilities from utility
companies operating within the city and use towers, poles, lines, cables and
other equipment and facilities for the system. When and where practicable,
the poles used by the grantee’s distribution system shall be those erected
and maintained by such utility companies operating within the city; provided,
mutually satisfactory rental agreements can be reached. It is the grantor’s
desire that all holders of public franchises in the city cooperate with the
grantee and allow the grantee the use of their poles and pole line facilities
whenever possible so that the number of new or additional poles installed in
the city may be minimized.



   (B)   Grantee’s poles. The grantee shall have the right to erect,
install and maintain its own towers, poles, guys, anchors, underground
conduits and manholes as may be necessary for the proper construction and
maintenance of the antenna site, head-end and distribution system; providing
that, the grantee has at the work site the necessary grantor permit or copy
thereof, for scheduled work, obtained in advance from the appropriate
department of the grantor.



   (C)   Rent of grantee’s poles. The grantee shall have the right to
establish terms, conditions and specifications governing the form, type,
size, quantity and location of equipment of others on its poles and shall
have the further right to charge a fair rental for attachment space occupied
by the equipment and plant of others. The grantor shall pay any costs
incurred by the grantee in providing space for the grantor’s attachments,
including any necessary rearrangements of the grantee’s equipment and plant
to provide room for the grantor’s attachments. Upon expiration, termination
or revocation of a franchise or if a grantee wishes to dispose of any of its
poles, conduit or manholes being used by the grantor, the grantor shall have
the option to purchase them in place for their fair market value.



   (D)   Underground facilities. In those areas of the city where
transmission or distribution facilities of both telephone and power companies
are underground or may be placed underground, the grantee shall likewise
construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution
facilities underground to the maximum extent the then-existing technology
permits, in accordance with the most recent National Electrical Code and its
successor document, as well as in conformance with all applicable state and
municipal ordinances and codes. If and when necessary, amplifiers and/or
transformers in the grantee’s transmission and distribution lines shall be
in appropriate housings on the surface of the ground. The grantee shall
obtain a permit from the grantor for such underground and construction of all
work required or pursuant to this section. Even when not required,
underground installation is preferable to the placing of additional poles.



   (E)   Compliance to codes.



      (1)   All transmission and distribution structures, lines and
equipment erected by the grantee in the city shall be located so as not to
endanger or interfere with the normal use of streets, alleys or other public
ways and places so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or
reasonable convenience of the general public and adjoining property owners
and so as not to interfere with existing public utility installations and so
as to comply with the most recent National Electrical Code, as amended, as
well as in conformance with all applicable state and municipal ordinances and
codes of general applicability.



      (2)   If any disturbance occurs by the grantee or its
equipment of pavement, sidewalks, driveway, lawn or other surfacing, the
grantee shall, at its expense and in the manner required by ordinance,
promptly replace and restore all such surfacing as near as reasonably
possible to its prior condition.



      (3)   The construction, installation, operation, maintenance
and/or removal of the cable communications system shall meet all of the
following safety, construction and technical specifications and codes and
standards:

regulations (OSHA);



         (b)   National Electrical Code;

requirements, including Federal Communications Commission rules and

restrictions as they exist or may be amended; and



         (f)   This code of ordinances.

poles, conduits or other fixtures aboveground or belowground where the poles,
conduits or other fixtures shall interfere with any prior placement of gas,
electric, telephone fixtures, water hydrants or other utilities, and all such
poles, conduits or other fixtures aboveground or belowground shall be so
placed as to comply with all the requirements of the grantor.



   (G)   Moving permits. The grantee shall, on request of any person
holding a moving permit issued by the grantor, temporarily move its wires or
fixtures to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary

grantee shall be given not less than 15 working days’ advance notice to
arrange for such temporary changes.



   (H)   Authority to trim trees. The grantee shall have the authority
to trim trees or other natural growth overhanging any of its cable system in
the street or alley right-of-way so as to prevent branches from coming in
contact with the grantee’s wires, cables or other equipment. The grantee
shall reasonably compensate the franchising authority or property owner for
any damages caused by such trimming or shall, in its sole discretion, and at
its own cost and expense, reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a
result of any construction of the cable system undertaken by grantee. Such
replacement shall satisfy any and all obligations the grantee may have to the
franchising authority pursuant to the terms of this section.



   (I)   Service area. The grantee shall design and construct the cable
system in such a manner as to pass by and provide adequate tap-off facilities
for every single-family dwelling, apartment, school and city building located
within the city limits based upon the corporate boundaries at the time of the
granting of the franchise; provided that, such locations meet the density
requirements pursuant to § 114.046 of this chapter, pertaining to extension
of service.

within two months of installation, weather permitting.

without the prior written consent of the franchising authority.



      (2)   Such consent as required by the franchising authority
shall be given or denied no later than 120 days following any request and
shall not be unreasonably withheld.



      (3)   Prior consent shall not be required when transferring

hypothecation or assignment of any rights, title or interest of the grantee
in the cable system in order to secure indebtedness.



   (B)   If the grantee sells or otherwise transfers ownership in the
cable system, such sale or transfer shall conform to § 617 of the Cable Act.
For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change,
transfer or acquisition of control, the franchising authority may inquire
into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee
shall assist the franchising authority in any such inquiry. In seeking the
grantee’s consent to any change in ownership or control, the transferee
shall have the responsibility to:



      (1)   Show to the satisfaction of the franchising authority
whether the proposed purchaser, transferee or assignee (referred to as the
“proposed transferee”) which, in the case of a corporation, shall include
all directors and all persons having a legal or equitable interest of 50% or
more of the voting stock, has:



         (a)   Ever been convicted or held liable for acts

or misrepresentation entered against it, her, him or them by any court of
competent jurisdiction; or



         (c)   Pending any legal claim, lawsuit or administrative
proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system. The franchising
authority retains the right to withhold approval of the transfer until the
transferee has provided the information required in this division (B)(1).



      (2)   Establish, to the satisfaction of the franchising
authority, the financial solvency of the proposed transferee by submitting
all current financial data for the proposed transferee which the grantee was
required to submit in its franchise application, and such other data as the
franchising authority may request, where such shall be audited, certified and
qualified by a certified public accountant; and



      (3)   Establish to the satisfaction of the franchising
authority any technical capability of the proposed transferee is such as
shall enable it to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining
term of the franchise under the existing franchise terms.



   (C)   (1)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction
and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the
franchising authority that the financial institution or its designee, as
approved in writing by the franchising authority, shall take control and
operate the cable system if the grantee defaults in its financial obligations.



      (2)   Further, such financial institution shall also submit a
plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance
with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution
exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not
exercise control over the cable system for a period exceeding one year,
unless extended by the franchising authority at its discretion, but, during
such period of time, it shall have the right to petition the franchising
authority to transfer the franchise to another grantee.



      (3)   Except insofar as the enforceability of this division
(C) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and
further subject to applicable federal, state or local law, if the franchising
authority finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial
and technical qualities of the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the
franchising authority shall transfer and assign the right and obligations of
such franchise as in the public interest.



   (D)   The consent or approval of the franchising authority to any
transfer by the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the
rights of the franchising authority in and to the streets, and any transfer
shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any
franchise.



   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be
approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the
franchise agreement.



   (F)   The franchising authority may approve the transfer or deny the
transfer pursuant to § 617 of the Cable Act.



   (G)   When the grantor approves a transfer under this section, the

test, analyze and report on the performance of the cable system. The grantor

opportunity to be present during such tests. If such testing demonstrates
that the grantee has substantially complied with such material provisions of

non-disruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with
the terms of this chapter. Such records shall include, but shall not be
limited to, any public records required to be kept by the grantee pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter, the
grantee shall not be required to disclose information that it reasonably
deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature under state and federal
rules of evidence. The franchising authority agrees to treat any information
disclosed by the grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to
employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know or in
order to enforce the provisions of this chapter. The grantee shall not be
required to provide subscriber information in violation of § 631 of the

sessions shall be open to the public, and notice thereof shall be published

be discussed. The review sessions may be canceled by mutual agreement of the

§ 131.001  THEFT.



   A person commits theft, which is prohibited, when the person does any
of the following:



   (A)   Takes possession or control of the property of another or
property in the possession of another, with the intent to deprive the other
thereof;



   (B)   Misappropriates property which the person has in trust or
property of another which the person has in the person’s possession or
control, whether such possession or control is lawful or unlawful, by using
or disposing of it in a manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the
trust or of the owner’s rights in such property, or conceals found property
or appropriates such property to the person’s own use, when the owner of
such property is known to the person. Failure by a bailee or lessee of
personal property to return the property within 72 hours after a time
specified in a written agreement of lease or bailment shall be evidence of
misappropriation;



   (C)   Obtains the labor or services of another or a transfer of
possession, control or ownership of the property of another or the beneficial
use of property of another, by deception. Where compensation for goods and
services is ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or
the rendering of such services, the refusal to pay or leaving the premises
without payment or offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner or
operator the right to pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an
inference that the goods or services were obtained by deception;



   (D)   Exercises control over stolen property, knowing such property
to have been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property
has been stolen, unless the person’s purpose is to promptly restore it to
the owner or to deliver it to an appropriate public officer. The fact that
the person is found in possession of property which has been stolen from two
or more persons on separate occasions or that the person is a dealer or other
person familiar with the value of such property and has acquired it for a
consideration which is far below its reasonable value shall be evidence from
which the court or jury may infer that the person knew or believed that the
property had been stolen;



   (E)   Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which
someone else has a security interest, with intent to defraud the secured
party;



   (F)   Makes, utters, draws, delivers or gives any check, share
draft, draft or written order on any bank, credit union, person or
corporation and obtains property, the use of property, including rental
property, or service in exchange for such instrument, if the person knows
that such check, share draft, draft or written order will not be paid when
presented. Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because
of insufficient funds, and the maker has not paid the holder of the
instrument the amount due thereon within ten days of the maker’s receipt of
notice from the holder that payment has been refused by the drawee, the court
or jury may infer from such facts that the maker knew that the instrument
would not be paid on presentation. Notice of refusal of payment shall be by
certified mail or by personal service in the manner prescribed for serving
original notices. Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment
because the maker has no account with the drawee, the court or jury may infer
from such fact that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on
presentation; and/or



   (G)   Obtains gas, electricity or water from a public utility or
obtains cable television or telephone service from an unauthorized connection
to the supply or service line or by intentionally altering, adjusting,
removing or tampering with the metering or service device so as to cause
inaccurate readings.

   It shall be unlawful to do or commit any of the following acts within
the city limits:



   (A)   Willfully attempt to tamper with or tamper with any motor
vehicle, or break or remove any part or parts of or from a motor vehicle
without the consent of the owner;



   (B)   Climb upon or enter into any motor vehicle whether it is in
motion or at rest and pilfer its contents or remove items of personal
property therefrom;



   (C)   Climb upon or enter into any motor vehicle without the consent
of the owner and commit any malicious mischief thereon whether it is in
action or at rest; and/or



   (D)   Climb upon or enter into any motor vehicle without the
owner’s consent, whether it is in action or at rest, and manipulate any of
the levers, starting mechanism, brakes or other mechanism or device of the
motor vehicle.

equipment, as defined in I.C.A. § 702.22, or unpurchased property of a store
or other mercantile establishment, either on the premises or outside the
premises, is material evidence of intent to deprive the owner, and the
finding of library materials or equipment or unpurchased property concealed
upon the person or among the belongings of the person is material evidence of
intent to deprive and, if the person conceals or causes to be concealed
library materials or equipment or unpurchased property, upon the person or
among the belongings of another, the finding of the concealed materials,
equipment or property is also material evidence of intent to deprive on the
part of the person concealing the library materials, equipment or goods.



   (B)   The fact that a person fails to return library materials for
two months or more after the date the person agreed to return the library
materials or fails to return library equipment for one month or more after
the date the person agreed to return the library equipment is evidence of
intent to deprive the owner, provided a reasonable attempt, including the
mailing by restricted certified mail of notice that such material or
equipment is overdue and criminal actions will be taken, has been made to
reclaim the materials or equipment. Notices stating the provisions of this
section and I.C.A. § 808.12 with regard to library materials or equipment
shall be posted in clear public view: in all public libraries; in all
libraries of educational, historical or charitable institutions,
organizations or societies; in all museums; and in all repositories of public
records.



   (C)   After the expiration of three days following the due date, the
owner of borrowed library equipment may request the assistance of a dispute
resolution center, mediation center or appropriate law enforcement agency in
recovering the equipment from the borrower.



   (D)   The owner of library equipment may require deposits by
borrowers and, for late returns, the owner may impose graduated penalties of
up to 25% of the value of the equipment, based upon the lateness of the
return.



   (E)   For lost library materials or equipment, arrangements may be
made to make a monetary settlement.

intergovernmental agency, if so designated by the Building Official) a
certificated of insurance, written by a company authorized to transact
business in the State of Iowa, in limits of not less than $500,000.00

and effect. It is the intent and purpose of said certificate of insurance to

with which the principal is associated. Homeowners working on their principal
residence shall be exempt from filing said certificate.

extinguishing systems and any other permanent equipment. Valuations shall be
established using square foot values with regional modifiers for the use and

The latest published valuations established by the International Code Council
are hereby adopted and shall be annually revised to incorporate newly
published values. The Building Official shall correct the determination of
value of any work for which a permit is issued, if such valuation appears to
be in error or misstated. If the permit or plan  review fees are reduced as
a result of such correction, a refund may be issued to the applicant. If such

         (b)   The dwelling unit is not in conformance at the end
of the period specified by the inspector in the written agreement. However,
the Inspector may extend the time specified in the agreement if, through no
fault of the owner and despite good faith efforts to comply, the work has
been delayed; or



         (c)   The Housing Inspector knows that the dwelling unit
is in violation of Ch. 156 of this code of ordinances. This division (G)(7)
shall not be construed to require the Housing Inspector to be knowledgeable

the Housing Inspector shall notify the operator and the occupants in writing.

   (B)   If the occupant does not abate the non-compliance within a
time set by the Housing Inspector, the Inspector may proceed against the
occupant and, if the non-compliance is substantial, shall require abatement
by the operator within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days, unless the
owner enters into a written agreement for additional time for abatement. The
operator may assess the reasonable cost thereof to the occupant plus the
costs of additional inspection.

person may ask the Housing Inspector to find that an emergency does exist
that constitutes a substantial hazard to the occupant’s health and safety.



   (B)   If the Housing Inspector finds that such an emergency exists
and that the owner or operator will not or cannot within a reasonable time
abate the emergency and that the emergency can be readily abated, the Housing
Inspector shall cause abatement and shall notify the owner by certified mail
of the actions taken, the cost to be assessed, and the owner’s right to
appeal under § 152.008(C) of this chapter.

§ 152.026  POLICY OF CITY.



   It is the declared public policy of the city that the preservation of
habitable housing stock, and of deteriorated housing stock which, upon
economically feasible rehabilitation, can again become habitable, is a matter
of the most serious public interest, and that the expenditure of public funds
toward the acquisition of abandoned and deteriorated housing stock, toward
its preservation and ultimate residential use by residents of the city, shall
be an expenditure for a valid public purpose.



(2013 Code, § 15.5-44)  (Ord. 14437, passed 8-23-1993)



§ 152.027  ABANDONED HOUSES; ACQUISITION FOR REHABILITATION.



   (A)   Deemed public nuisance.



      (1)   A residential dwelling structure which has been
determined to be by court decree in violation of the city’s Housing
Maintenance and Occupancy Code and such violations have not been cured for a
period of over six consecutive months, shall be deemed a public nuisance,
unless:



         (a)   The owner, or a person acting on behalf of or at
the direction of the owner of the structure is actively engaged in the
correction of such code violations and has made substantial progress and can
be completed within 30 days after the expiration of the six-month period; or



         (b)   The structure is the subject of legal proceedings
other than code enforcement proceedings that make the structure legally
unavailable for either rehabilitation or habitation during all or any part of
such period.



      (2)   The fact that a city building permit of any type has
been issued, either before or during the 30-day notice period identified in
division (A) above for repair or reconstruction of, or installation of
equipment or materials in, such a structure shall not of itself be evidence
of active engagement in the correction of code violations.



   (B)   Notice of acquisition or demolition. Upon application or upon
its own motion, the City Council may cause notice to be given to the holder
or holders of record title to any such structure by certified mail, return
receipt requested, advising such owner or owners, that:



      (1)   If it is economically feasible to repair such structure,
then under the conditions set forth in division (A) above, the city may
acquire such structure for resale by open public bidding to a purchaser who
shall agree, as a condition of its purchase, to rehabilitate such structure
and correct such code violations as exist at the time of purchase, within a
determined reasonable period of time, for rehabitation as a residential
dwelling structure; or



      (2)   If it is not economically feasible to repair such
structure, then the city shall take action to ensure the demolition of the
structure and the leveling of the lot or parcel upon which it is situated.



   (C)   Repair and rehabilitation not to exceed fair market value. For
purposes of this subchapter, a property shall be deemed not to be
economically feasible to repair and rehabilitate if, in the opinion of the
City Council, as advised by persons expert in the construction, repair and
appraisal of residential structures, the cost of reasonable repair and
rehabilitation of the structure, when added to the value of the property at
the time of the Council’s determination, together exceed the fair market
value to which the property would attain upon completion of such reasonable
repair and rehabilitation.



   (D)   Manner of acquisition. If, upon having given notice to the
holder or holders of record title to such structure as set forth in division
(B) above, such holder or holders do not commence active repair and
rehabilitation of such structure within 30 days of such mailing, and continue
without delay in such active repair and rehabilitation until code violations
have been corrected, then the City Council may direct the City Manager to
obtain an appraisal of the fair market value of such property and to commence
negotiations for its acquisition from such holder or holders and, if the city
fails in such direct negotiations to acquire record title to such property,
the City Council may direct the commencement of eminent domain proceedings
toward the acquisition of such record title, for resale of such property
within a reasonable period of time, and upon conditions which require prompt
rehabilitation and correction of code violations and its use as a residential
dwelling structure, in any case where early resale, repair, rehabilitation
and rehabitation appear likely of accomplishment.

FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICTS




§ 156.395  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The legislature of the state has delegated the responsibility to cities
to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health
and the general welfare.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.396  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of
the community.



   (B)   These losses, hazards and related adverse effects are caused
by:



      (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable
to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being
inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood; and



      (2)   The cumulative effect of floodplain construction on
flood flows, which causes increases in flood heights and flood water
velocities.



   (C)   (1)   This subchapter relies upon engineering methodology
for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards
established by the state’s Department of Natural Resources.



      (2)   This methodology consists of a series of interrelated
steps including:



         (a)   Determination of flood magnitudes and the
corresponding flood frequencies by statistical and engineering calculations
which permits a consideration of such flood factors as expected frequency of
occurrence, area inundated and depth of inundation;



         (b)   Calculation of water surface profiles based upon
hydraulic engineering analysis of capability of the stream channel and
overbank areas to convey flood flows; and



         (c)   Computation and delineation of a floodway, an area
which must be reserved (no obstructions) for conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be substantially increased by
future encroachment on the floodplain.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.397  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare by minimizing those flood losses described in §
156.396 of this chapter with provisions designed to:



   (A)   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood
flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased
substantially;



   (B)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in
flood heights or velocities;



   (C)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public
utilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction;



   (D)   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard; and



   (E)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in
the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood
Insurance Program.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.398  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   BASEMENT. Any enclosed area of a building which has its floor or lowest
level below ground level (subgrade) on all sides. Also see LOWEST FLOOR.



   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.



   FACTORY-BUILT HOME. Any structure, designed for residential use, which
is wholly or in substantial part, made, fabricated, formed or assembled in
manufacturing facilities for installation or assembly and installation on a
building site. For the purpose of this subchapter, FACTORY-BUILT HOMES
include mobile homes, manufactured homes and modular homes.



   FACTORY-BUILT HOME PARK. A parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided
into two or more factory-built home lots for rent or sale.



   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas resulting from the overflow of streams
or rivers from the unusual and rapid runoff of surface waters from any source.



   FLOOD ELEVATION. The elevation flood waters would reach at a particular
site during the occurrence of a specific flood. For instance, the 100-YEAR
FLOOD ELEVATION is that elevation of flood waters related to the occurrence
of the 100-year flood.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP. The official map prepared as part of (but
published separately from) the Flood Insurance Study which delineates both
the flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.



   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. A study initiated, funded and published by the
Federal Insurance Administration for the purpose of evaluating in detail the
existence and severity of flood hazards, providing the city with the
necessary information for adopting a floodplain management program and
establishing actuarial flood insurance rates.



   FLOODPLAIN. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water as a
result of a flood.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. An overall program of corrective and preventive
measures for reducing flood damages and promoting the wise use of
floodplains, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans,
flood control works, flood-proofing and floodplain management regulations.



   FLOOD-PROOFING. Any combination of structural or non-structural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures, including utility and
sanitary facilities which will reduce or eliminate flood damage to such
structures.



   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel, which are reasonably required to carry and
discharge flood waters or flood flows so that confinement of flood flows to
the floodway area will not result in substantially higher flood levels and
flow velocities.



   FLOODWAY FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain, other than the
floodway, which can be filled, leveed or otherwise obstructed without causing
substantially higher flood levels or flow velocities.



   LOWEST FLOOR.



      (1)   The floor of the lowest enclosed area in a building
including a basement, except when all the following criteria are met:



         (a)   The enclosed area is designed to flood to equalize
hydrostatic pressure during flood events;



         (b)   The enclosed area is unfinished (not carpeted,
drywalled and the like) and used solely for low damage potential uses such as
building access, parking or storage;



         (c)   Machinery and service facilities (e.g., hot water
heater, furnace, electrical service) contained in the enclosed area are
located at least one foot above the 100-year flood level; and



         (d)   The enclosed area is not a “basement”, as
defined in this section.



      (2)   In cases where the lowest enclosed area satisfies the
criteria in divisions (1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(c) and (1)(d) above, the LOWEST
FLOOR is the floor of the next highest enclosed area that does not satisfy
the criteria above.

structures or development for which the start of construction commenced on or
after the effective date of this chapter.



   ONE HUNDRED (100-) YEAR FLOOD. A flood, the magnitude of which has a 1%
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year or which, on the
average, will be equaled or exceeded at least once every 100 years.



   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires
more or less permanent location on the ground or attached to something having
a permanent location on the ground, including, but without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, advertising signs, billboards, back stops for
tennis courts and pergolas.



   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition

damage occurred.



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.



      (1)   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed.



      (2)   Any addition which increases the original floor area of

elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one
foot above the 100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers) may be allowed, subject to favorable consideration
by the Board of Adjustment and issuance of a special use permit, where
existing topography, street grades or other factors preclude elevating by
fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the
structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated with
flooding. All new residential buildings shall be provided with a means of
access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.



      (3)   Non-residential buildings. All new or substantially
improved non-residential buildings shall have the first floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level, or
together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood-proofed to
such a level. When flood- proofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the state shall certify that the flood-proofing methods used
are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and
uplift forces and other factors associated with the 100-year flood, and that
the structure, below the 100-year flood level, is water-tight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to National
Geodetic Vertical Datum) to which any structures are flood-proofed shall be
maintained by the Zoning Administrator.



      (4)   New and improved structures. All new and substantially
improved structures:



         (a)   Fully enclosed areas below the “lowest floor”
(not including basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or
exceed the following minimum criteria.



            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.



            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot above grade.



            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the
automatic entry and exit of flood waters.



         (b)   New and substantially improved structures must be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.



         (c)   New and substantially improved structures must be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.



      (5)   Factory-built homes.



         (a)   Factory-built homes including those placed in
existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse or lateral movement.



         (b)   Factory-built homes including those placed in
existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum
of one foot above the 100-year flood level.



      (6)   Utility and sanitary systems.



         (a)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the system as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater
treatment facilities shall be provided with a level of flood protection equal
to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.



         (b)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.



         (c)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system. Water supply treatment facilities shall be provided with a level of
protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood
elevation.



         (d)   Utilities such as gas and electrical systems shall
be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the
system and the risk associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.



      (7)   Flammable materials and the like. Storage of materials
and equipment that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the
100-year flood level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly
elevated, or:



         (a)   Not be subject to major flood damage and be
anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters; or



         (b)   Be readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.



      (8)   Flood control structural works. Flood control structural
works such as levees, flood walls and the like shall provide, at a minimum,
protection from a 100-year flood with a minimum of three feet of design
freeboard and shall provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition,
structural flood control works shall be approved by the state’s Department
of Natural Resources.



      (9)   Affect. No use shall affect the capacity or conveyance
of the channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage
ditch or other drainage facility or system.



      (10)   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built
home parks and subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize
flood damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
flood damage. Development associated with subdivision proposals shall meet
the applicable performance standards. Subdivision proposals intended for
residential development shall provide all lots with a means of vehicular
access that will remain dry during occurrence of the 100-year flood.



      (11)   Detached structures. The exemption of detached garages,
sheds and similar structures from the 100-year flood elevation requirements
may result in increased premium rates for insurance coverage of the structure
and contents, however, said detached garages, sheds and similar accessory
type structures are exempt from the 100-year flood elevation requirements
when:



         (a)   The structure shall not be used for human
habitation;

not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this subchapter will result in
unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable
standards.



      (1)   No variance shall be granted for any development within
the Floodway Overlay District which would result in any increase in the
100-year level. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood
levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development
would be allowed for similarly situated lands.



      (2)   Variances shall only be granted upon:



         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and



         (c)   A determination that the granting of the variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public.



      (3)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination
that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.



      (4)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of
flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
subchapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of
the Zoning Administrator that the issuance of a variance will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance and such construction increases
risks to life and property.



   (E)   Hearings and decisions of the Board of Adjustment.



      (1)   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment
of an appeal, an application for a special use or a request for a variance,
the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to
parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by
agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may require
the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation
of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
state’s Department of Natural Resources.



      (2)   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an
appeal, special use or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an
appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
provisions of this subchapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and it
shall make its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and
the reasons for its decision. In granting a special use or variance, the
Board shall consider such factors as contained in this section and all other
relevant sections of this subchapter.



         (a)   Factors upon which the decision of the Board shall
be based. In passing upon applications for special uses or requests for
variances, the Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this subchapter, and:



            1.   The danger to life and property due to
increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments;



            2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to
other lands or downstream to the injury of others;



            3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation
systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination
and unsanitary conditions;



            4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility
and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the
individual owner;



            5.   The importance of the services provided by
the proposed facility to the community;



            6.   The requirements of the facility for a
floodplain location;



            7.   The availability of alternative locations not
subject to flooding for the proposed use;



            8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with
existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;



            9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the
Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for the area;



            10.   The safety of access to the property in
times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;



            11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration,
rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site;
and



            12.   Such other factors which are relevant to the
purpose of this subchapter.



         (b)   Conditions attached to special uses or variances.



            1.   Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of special uses
or variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this subchapter.



            2.   Such conditions may include, but not
necessarily be limited to:



               a.   Modification of waste disposal and
water supply facilities;



               b.   Limitation on periods of use and
operation;



               c.   Imposition of operational controls,
sureties and deed restrictions; and



               d.   Requirements for construction of
channel modifications, dikes, levees and other protective measures; provided,
such are approved by the state’s Department of Natural Resources and are
deemed the only practical alternative to achieving the purposes of this
subchapter.



         (c)   Flood-proofing measures.



            1.   Flood-proofing measures shall be deigned
consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood
velocities, durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces and
other forces associated with the regulatory flood.



            2.   The Board of Adjustment shall require that
the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered
professional engineer that the flood-proofing measures are consistent with
the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for
the particular area.



            3.   Such flood-proofing measures may include, but
are not necessarily limited to the following:



               a.   Anchorage to resist flotation and
lateral movement;



               b.   Installation of water-tight doors,
bulkheads and shutters, or similar methods of construction;



               c.   Reinforcement of walls to resist water
pressure;



               d.   Use of paints, membranes or mortars to
reduce seepage of water through walls;



               e.   Addition of mass or weight structures
to resist flotation;



               f.   Installation of pumps to lower water
levels in structures;



               g.   Construction of water supply and waste
treatment systems so as to prevent the entrance of flood waters;



               h.   Pumping facilities or comparable
practices for subsurface drainage systems for building to relieve external
foundation wall and basement flood pressures;



               i.   Construction to resist rupture or
collapse cause by water pressure or floating debris;



               j.   Installation of valves or controls on
sanitary and storm drains which will permit the drains to be closed to
prevent backup of sewage and storm waters into the buildings or structures;
and



               k.   Location of all electrical equipment,
circuits and installed electrical appliances in a manner which will assure
they are not subject to flooding.



         (d)   Appeals to the Court.



            1.   Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court
of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is
illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality.



            2.   Such petition shall be presented to the court
within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board.

§ 156.414  NON-CONFORMING USES.



   A structure or the use of a structure or parcel of land which was
lawful before the passage or amendment of the ordinance, but which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this subchapter may be continued subject to
the following conditions.



   (A)   No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in
a way which increases its non- conformity.



   (B)   No structural alteration, addition or repair to any
non-conforming structure over the life of the structure shall exceed 50% of
its value at the time of its becoming a non-conforming use, unless the
structure is permanently changed to a conforming use.



   (C)   (1)   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive
months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this
subchapter.



      (2)   The Assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in
writing of instances of non- conforming uses which have been discontinued for
six months.



   (D)   If any non-conforming use or structure is destroyed by any
means, including floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its value prior to
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except in conformity with the
provisions of this subchapter.



   (E)   Uses or adjuncts thereof which are or become nuisances shall
not be entitled to continue as non- conforming uses.

NON-CONFORMING USES




§ 156.445  NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND.



   The non-conforming use of land (where no principal building is
involved) existing on the effective date of this chapter may be continued for
a period of not more than five years thereafter; provided that, no such
non-conforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or extended either in
the same or adjoining property. If such non-conforming use of land or any
portion thereof is discontinued or changed, any future use of such land shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.446  NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS.



   (A)   General. The lawful use of a building existing at the
effective date of this chapter may be continued although such use does not
conform to the provisions thereof. If no structural alterations are made, a
non-conforming use of a building may be changed to another non-conforming use
of the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a non-conforming
use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such
use shall not be changed thereafter to a less restricted use. The
non-conforming use of a building may be extended throughout those parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use on the
effective date of this chapter.



   (B)   Non-conforming use created by changes in ordinance. Whenever
the use of a building becomes a non-conforming use through a change in this
chapter or district boundaries, such use may be continued as provided in
division (A) above.



   (C)   Discontinuance of non-conforming building and uses. Any
building or portion thereof used in whole or in part for non-conforming uses,
which hereafter becomes and remains vacant for a continuous period of six
months shall not again be used, except in conformity with the regulations of
the district in which such building or land is situated.



   (D)   Damaged non-conforming buildings.



      (1)   Any building or portion thereof used in whole or in part
for non-conforming uses which has been damaged by fire, explosions, act of
God or a public enemy to the extent of more than 50% of the fair market value
of the building immediately prior to damage, shall not be restored, except in
conformity with the regulations in this chapter.



      (2)   If a building is damaged by less than 50% of the fair
market value, it may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time
of damage; provided that, a permit for such repairs or reconstruction is
issued within 12 months of the date of such damage.

   Pending the issuance, a regular certificate of occupancy may be issued
for a period not exceeding six months for partial occupancy of a building
during its construction or during the completion of the structural
alteration. Such temporary certificate of occupancy shall not be construed as
in any way altering the respective rights, duties or obligation of the owner
or of the city relating to the use or the occupancy of the premises or any
other provisions of this chapter. Such temporary certificate shall not be
issued, except under such restrictions and provisions as shall adequately
ensure the safety of the occupants.

   (D)   Enforcement. Any violation of this subchapter shall be
punishable by § 156.999 of this chapter.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.485  LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.



   (A)   (1)   Any required landscaping shall be in place at the
time an occupancy permit is approved.



      (2)   Should completion of landscaping be delayed because of
the season of the year, a temporary occupancy permit may be issued if the
developer posts a bond or other acceptable guarantee in the amount of the
landscaping as completed.



      (3)   When filing a site plan, a developer may submit a list
of alternate and substitute species from the permitted or established list to

(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)




BUFFERING AND LANDSCAPING




§ 156.500  PURPOSE.



   Buffers provide transition and physical barriers between properties of
differing land uses to reduce the effects of sight, sound and other
incompatibilities. The creation of districts in itself does not sufficiently
protect adjoining properties from possible detrimental influences.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.501  BUFFERING.



   (A)   Conditions requiring a buffer. Any lot in a commercial or
industrial district, with the exception of the CBD and TN Districts, abutting
any residential district shall be buffered.



   (B)   Burden of providing buffers. In all cases, the entire burden
of providing the buffer shall be on the owner of the commercial or industrial
property. Where lots in two different districts, requiring a buffer between
them, are both in an existing improved condition, the requirements of this
subchapter are not retroactive. However, in the event that any or all of the
commercial or industrial improved property is destroyed or demolished, for
the purpose of renewal, redevelopment or improvement, that portion of said
property shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.



   (C)   General buffer requirements.



      (1)   No part of any required buffer shall be used for
parking, storage, loading, locating refuse containers or any similar activity
which may create a nuisance.



      (2)   Buffers shall be properly maintained to satisfy the
intended purpose in perpetuity.



      (3)   Landscape plantings should be predominately evergreen
type trees and shrubs to provide year-round screening. Landscape plantings
shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the required buffer.



      (4)   Buffers shall be located on the entire common perimeter
between the contrasting districts and extend to the lot lines.



      (5)   Where the line between two districts requiring a buffer
follows a public street right-of-way, stream or other similar barrier, the
requirement for a buffer area may be waived by the Plan and Zoning
Commission; provided that, such waiver does not permit the exposure of
undesirable characteristics of land use to the public view.



   (D)   Buffer methods. Buffers required in this chapter shall be
accomplished by any one or approved combination of the following options.



      (1)   Lots platted or combined after the effective date of
this chapter.



         (a)   A buffer yard of 60 feet in width that includes a
planting schedule equivalent to one overstory (or evergreen) tree and three
shrubs per 35 linear feet of buffer; or



         (b)   A buffer yard of 30 feet in width that includes a
planting schedule equivalent to one overstory (or evergreen) tree, two
ornamental trees and six shrubs per 35 linear feet of buffer.



      (2)   Existing lots platted prior to the effective date of
this chapter.



         (a)   A buffer yard of 15 feet in width that includes a
planting schedule equivalent to a continuous row of overstory, evergreen and
ornamental trees that effectively provides a solid visual barrier; or



         (b)   For existing lots platted prior to the effective
date of this chapter that can provide evidence that the buffer required by
this section would render the property unbuildable, the City Council may
grant a waiver of the requirements. In such instances, the City Council may
require the installation of a solid fence or wall to meet the intent of this
chapter. The fence or wall shall be six feet in height and shall be
constructed of a permanent, low maintenance material such as brick, stone,
textured concrete, tile block, cedar or other similar materials determined
appropriate by the Plan and Zoning Commission. The face of the fence or wall
should be equally attractive on both sides of the structure. Provisions for
landscaping to soften the visual appearance of the structure and to provide
additional buffering may be required by the Plan and Zoning Commission and
shall be reviewed on an individual case basis.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.502  SCREENING.



   (A)   Conditions requiring a buffer. Any lot in a commercial or
industrial district, with the exception of the CBD and TN Districts, abutting
any residential district shall be required to have adequate screening of
dumpsters and storage facilities.



   (B)   Mechanical units. For all new development or redevelopment,
all ground mounted mechanical units, including, but not limited to,
air-conditioning condensers, heat pumps, ventilation units, computer cooling
equipment and any other related utility structures and equipment that are
visible from any adjacent public thoroughfare shall be visibly screened from
public view by the use of a screening wall built of materials compatible and
consistent with the materials of the principal building; landscape plantings
of predominantly evergreen type trees and shrubs to provide year-round
screening; permanent earth-berming; or a combination of the above.



   (C)   Trash dumpsters and receptacles. Trash receptacles and
dumpsters shall be screened on all sides by the use of a permanent enclosure,
with gates for disposal truck access. The enclosure shall be constructed to
visibly screen the receptacle from public view and from adjoining properties.



   (D)   Outdoor storage and loading areas. Any outdoor storage area or
loading area that is visible from any public thoroughfare or any residential
use shall be visibly screened from public view and adjoining properties with
landscape plantings that are predominantly evergreen type trees and shrubs to
provide year-round screening; permanent earth-berming; or the use of a
screening wall built of materials compatible and consistent with the
materials of the principal building.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.503  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of parking lot landscaping requirements
are as follows:



      (1)   Aesthetics and improved design. Improve the aesthetic
appearance and overall community design of the city to enhance the natural
and built environments; and



      (2)   Public safety. Ensure that pedestrians and vehicles can
safely use the parking lot.



   (B)   Applicability. The following requirements shall not apply to
parking lots in the CBD Zoning District:



      (1)   New parking lots;



      (2)   Whenever a building or lot existing prior to the
effective date of this chapter changes use or is altered or reconstructed by
one or more additions, the sum total which increases the floor area by 20% or
more, the uses combined within the building and all enlargements shall
thereafter comply with the parking and buffering requirements set forth
herein;



      (3)   Whenever, by one or more reconstructions, a parking lot
of more than 25 spaces is repaved or reconstructed by more than 20%, the lot
shall comply with the requirements set forth herein; and



      (4)   The following are exempt from the requirements of this
chapter:



         (a)   Any off-street parking exclusively used for
single-family detached or single-family attached use;



         (b)   Any parking ramp or permanently covered area; and



         (c)   Any lot designed and built for industrial or
manufacturing uses that provide no parking area for the public on a regular
basis.



   (C)   Submittal requirements for all parking lots.



      (1)   Landscape plan required. A landscape plan for all
parking lots regardless of size shall be prepared and submitted to the city
for review and approval for any landscaping, buffer or screening required by
the city.



      (2)   Preparation of landscape plan. To encourage landscape
plans to be thoughtfully arranged so site elements are artfully and
technically organized in a way that conveys meaning, coherence and spatial
organization, a qualified individual or organization, as acceptable to the
Zoning Administrator, shall prepare the landscape plan.



      (3)   Landscape plan contents. All landscape plans are subject
to the requirements of §§ 156.480 through 156.486 of this chapter.



   (D)   Approval procedure.



      (1)   Prior to the issuance of any building permit, all
required landscape plans shall be reviewed and approved by the Zoning
Administrator. No landscaping plan shall be approved unless it conforms to
the requirements of this subchapter, except as noted elsewhere in this
chapter.



      (2)   All landscaping areas shall be provided and all
landscape materials shall be installed consistent with the approved
landscaping plan, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.



   (E)   Parking area minimum landscaping requirement.



      (1)   A landscape area shall be required along the full length
of any side of a parking area that abuts any adjoining property (front, rear,
side yard lot lines). The landscape area shall be provided between the
parking area and the property line, and shall have a minimum width of five
feet. The landscaped area shall include grass ground cover, shrubs, trees and
other similar planting or ground cover material acceptable to the city.
Landscape plantings shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the required
landscape areas. All parking lots shall have curbing of acceptable materials
to the city around the perimeter of the parking lot.



      (2)   This requirement shall not be necessary for
multi-property developments on the side where shared parking will be
utilized. Clear plans shall be shown as to how the adjacent property will
share parking when it is developed.



      (3)   Any new development adjacent to a shared parking setup
shall utilize that existing adjoining shared parking area.



   (F)   Additional parking area landscaping requirements for larger
parking lots. Parking areas consisting, in their entirety, of 25 or more
parking spaces shall be required to provide the additional landscaping
treatments in this division (F), in addition to the five feet minimum
landscaping requirement noted in division (E) above.



      (1)   Curbed entrance aisles shall be placed on both sides of
all entrance drives and access roadways from the public street system to
direct vehicles in and out of the site.



      (2)   Large parking areas shall be divided into smaller
parking fields of no more than 200 parking stalls. The size of these parking
fields is dependent upon the overall size of the parking lot, the number of
entrance roads, the number of commercial uses and other site-specific
factors. Each parking lot landscaping plan shall include design elements to

   The provisions of this subchapter are applicable when/for:



   (A)   The development of principal and accessory uses;



   (B)   Whenever a building existing prior to the effective date of
this chapter is structurally altered by one or more additions, the sum total
of which increases the floor area 20 % or more, the uses contained within the
building and all enlargements shall thereafter comply with the parking
requirements set forth herein;



   (C)   No parking requirements apply to the CBD and TN Districts,
with the exception that new or rehabbed mixed-use or residential
developments, as of 1-1-2010 shall have one parking space for each dwelling
unit on site or at a site approved by the Zoning Administrator;



   (D)   Commercial parking requirements shall be reduced by the number
of on-street parking spaces in front of the commercial property. In the case
of mixed uses, the parking and stacking spaces required shall equal the sum
of requirements for the various uses computed separately, unless the
businesses operate at substantially different hours (e.g., retail store and
nightclub), at which point each parking space may be used towards the
minimums of each use;



   (E)   All new and reconfigured parking lots greater than 25 spaces
shall obtain a parking lot permit application from the Zoning Administrator
prior to work being completed. Repaving of more than 20% of a lot shall
require a parking lot permit application; and



   (F)   These requirements may be met with non-surface parking, such
as rooftop parking, below-grade parking or multi-level parking structures;

(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.570  SPECIAL USES.



   (A)   Antenna structures.



      (1)   Special use permit not required. Any antenna that is
attached to an existing antenna support structure, smoke stack, water tower
or other tall structure, is permitted in all zoning districts. The height of
the antenna shall not exceed the height of the existing tall structure by
more than 20 feet. If the antenna is to be mounted on an existing tall
structure, a site plan shall not be required.



      (2)   Special use permit required. Antenna support structures
and antennas for entities providing licensed or unlicensed communications
services, including, but not limited to, cellular, personal communications
services (PCS), specialized mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized
mobilized radio (ESMR), paging and similar services that is either not
mounted on existing tall structure or is more than 20 feet higher than the
tall structure on which it is to be mounted shall not be permitted, except
pursuant to the following conditions.



         (a)   An application must be completed and returned to
the Zoning Officer accompanied by a current fee for a special use permit.



         (b)   The application at a minimum must contain the
following information.



            1.   Necessity. The wireless communications
company shall demonstrate, using technological evidence that the antenna must
be located where it is proposed in order to satisfy the antenna’s function
in the company’s system.



            2.   Co-location effort. If the applicant proposes
to build an antenna support structure (as opposed to mounting the antenna on
an existing tall structure), it shall demonstrate that it contacted the
owners of tall structures within a one-quarter mile radius of the site
proposed, asked for a permission to install the antenna on those tall
structures and was denied for reasons other than failure to agree on
compensation. The Board of Adjustment may deny the permit if it concludes
that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on
an existing tall structure.



            3.   Antenna height. The applicant shall
demonstrate, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Adjustment, that
the antenna is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. No
antenna that is taller than this minimum height shall be approved.



            4.   Setbacks from base of antenna support
structure. The minimum distance between the base of the support structure or
any guy anchors and any property line shall be the largest of the following:



               a.   Fifty percent of the antenna height;



               b.   The minimum setback in the underlying
zoning district; and



               c.   Sixty feet.



            5.   Antenna support structure safety. The
applicant shall demonstrate, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board of
Adjustment, that the proposed antenna and support structure are safe and the
surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by support structure
failure, falling ice or other debris, or radio frequency interference. All
structures shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices, as approved by the
manufacturers.



            6.   Fencing. An opaque fence shall be installed
around the antenna support structure and other equipment, unless the antenna
is mounted on an existing structure. The fence shall be a maximum of six feet
in height and serve to screen the base of the structure and to improve
security.



            7.   Co-location. In order to reduce the number of
antenna support structures needed in the community in the future, the
proposed support structure shall be required to accommodate other users,
including other wireless communications companies, and local police, fire and
ambulance companies.



            8.   FCC license. The applicant shall provide
proof that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.



            9.   Required parking. If the site is fully
automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the
site is not automated, the number of required parking spaces shall equal the
number of people on the largest shift.



            10.   Painting. Antenna support structures should
be painted in such a manner as to reduce the visual impact and create a
harmonious appearance with its surroundings.



            11.   Site plan. A full site plan shall be
required for all cell sites, showing the antenna, antenna support structure,
building, fencing, buffering and access.



            12.   Air safety. Support structures 200 feet in
height or taller, or those near airports, shall meet all Federal Aviation
Administration requirements.



         (c)   The applicant must show that the proposed antenna
support structure, antenna or accessory structure will be placed in a
reasonably available location that will minimize the visual impact on the
surrounding area and allow the facility to function in accordance with the
minimum standards imposed by applicable communications regulations and
applicant’s technical design requirements.



         (d)   Antenna support structures in residential
neighborhoods are strongly discouraged. The application for a permit in a
residential neighborhood must prove that the area cannot be adequately served
by a facility placed in a non-residential neighborhood for valid technical
reasons.



         (e)   All antenna support structures and communications
facilities at sites other than the A-1 and M Districts at a minimum shall be
a monopole. All antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment or to look other than a tower, such as light poles, power poles
and trees. At a minimum, all towers not requiring FAA painting or markings
shall have an exterior finish which is galvanized or painted dull blue, gray
or black. Existing non-monopole antenna support structures shall be allowed
to continue. Additional antennas may be added to existing non-monopole
structures provided that other requirements of this special use section are
followed. If an existing non-monopole structure has been damaged by more than
50% of the fair market value prior to the damage, the replacement of the
antenna shall conform to all requirements of this section including the
monopole requirement.



         (f)   There shall be no change in the exterior
appearance of the approved site, including any change in the profile of the
antenna support structure, that is a departure from or addition to what was
shown or represented in the application for the granted special use permit,
without first obtaining a new special use permit for that site through the
same process as for obtaining the initial special use permit, including the
review and recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission.



         (g)   If an additional antenna is installed on an
existing antenna support structure, engineering data and certification by a
licensed professional engineer assuring that the installation is structurally
sound within the standards of good engineering practice shall be provided to
the city’s Building Official.



         (h)   If a site, or any antenna support structure, is
not used for a period of one year, it shall be the duty and obligation of the
party then in possession and control of the site to have the unused antenna
support structure and any other unused cell site apparatus completely
dismantled and removed from the site. Once the antenna support structure is
removed, it shall be reconstructed according to this special use section,
including the monopole requirement.



      (3)   Placement on city owned property. The placement of
antennas or antenna support structures on city-owned property must comply
with the following minimum requirements:



         (a)   Approval by the City Council is required when
placing antennas or towers on any piece of property owned by the city;



         (b)   The antenna or antenna support structure will not
interfere with the purpose for which the city-owned property is intended;



         (c)   The antenna or antenna support structure will have
no adverse impact on surrounding private property;



         (d)   The applicant will produce proof of adequate
liability insurance for potential damage antennas or towers could reasonably
cause to city property and facilities and commit to a lease agreement which
includes equitable compensation for the use of public land and other
necessary provisions and safeguards. The charge for the use of a city
structure shall be negotiated by the City Council;



         (e)   The applicant will submit a letter of credit,
performance bond or other security acceptable to the city to cover the cost
of antenna or antenna support structure removal;



         (f)   The antennas or antenna support structure will not
interfere with other intended uses of the property;



         (g)   Upon reasonable notice, the antennas or antenna
support structures may be required to be removed at the user’s expense;



         (h)   The applicant must reimburse the city for any
costs which it incurs because of the presence of the applicant’s antenna or
antenna support structure; and



         (i)   The applicant will cooperate with the city’s
objective to promote collocations and thus limit the number of separate
antenna sites requested.

   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   CONCEPT PLAN. A preliminary drawing of the proposal identifying
specific uses, population densities, the developments relationship with
surrounding uses, building intensities, proposed circulation patterns, parks,
school sites and other land uses.



   MASTER PLAN. A schematic plan for a unified, coordinated development of
a tract of contiguous land which is designated in an integrated and
coordinated basis showing trees, water lines and appurtenances, sanitary
sewers and appurtenances, storm water management facilities and
appurtenances, lot boundaries, building locations, parking and loading areas,
access drives, landscaping, existing and proposed grades, buffers and other
information as required to properly depict and communicate the proposed
utilization and improvement of the property.



   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.



      (1)   A development of land that is under unified control and
is planned and developed as a whole in a single development operation or
programmed series of development stages.



      (2)   The development plans shall include, but not be limited
to, land use, streets and circulation ways, utilities, population densities,
buildings, open spaces and other site features.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.586  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) is for more efficient
use of land and public services in two basic situations:



   (A)   Vacant land. Areas of not less than two acres where strict
regulation may restrict the full achievement of the Comprehensive Guide Plan;
or



   (B)   Built-up and aged areas. Areas of not less than 30,000 square
feet of minimum lot needing rehabilitation and redevelopment, including such
areas which may be deficient in public facilities and services, where such
necessary redevelopment cannot be expected to take place in strict and
established areas of the city.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.587  APPLICATION.



   (A)   Ownership.



      (1)   A tract shall be under such control that each owner is
bound by the conditions and regulations which shall be effective within the
PUD and which will result in recordable easements, covenants and other
provisions.



      (2)   Each PUD shall be numbered in sequence.



   (B)   Permitted uses. A PUD may include a mixture of such principal
types of land use as residential, commercial, industrial and institutional,
and the extent of each use shall be determined by the type of PUD proposed
and as hereinafter provided. Uses shall not result in undue adverse effect on
the surrounding area and shall be consistent with the intent of this
subchapter and the concept of the proposed PUD.



   (C)   Decision criteria. The following objectives are sought:



      (1)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a
variety of housing and building types, by permitting an increased density per
acre and by reducing dimensions, yards and building setbacks;



      (2)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas
and, if permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of
accessory commercial uses and services;



      (3)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes
natural topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other
vegetation, and prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;



      (4)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved
through conventional development;



      (5)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities and community facilities objectives of the
Comprehensive Guide Plan; and



      (6)   Non-residential developments planned as groups, in
park-like surroundings with common ingress points and common parking; with
screened loading, storage and parking areas; with buffer areas to adjacent
lands which are fully landscaped and with areas set aside for future
expansion.

   (B)   (1)   The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings,

of the Board and shall be a public record.



      (2)   A city representative shall serve as Secretary of the
Board and keep its records.



   (C)   The Board shall have power to call on any municipal department
or officer for assistance in the performance of its duties, and it shall be
the duty of any such department to render such assistance as may reasonably
be required.



   (D)   The Board shall adopt, from time to time, such rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary to carry into effect the power and
authority granted it by the provisions of this chapter or any state law.

   (F)   The Board shall render its decisions without unreasonable
delay.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.622  JURISDICTION.



   The Board shall have the following powers and authority:



   (A)   Appeals. To hear and decide an appeal where it is alleged
there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter;



   (B)   Exceptions. To grant an exception in the following instances:



      (1)   In the extension of a district where the boundary line
of a district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership on the
effective date of this chapter;



      (2)   In the determination that the actual street layout on
the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the District Map;



      (3)   In the erection and use of a building or the use of
premises for railroads or public utility purposes;



      (4)   In the reconstruction of a non-conforming building which
has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or a public enemy, to the
extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, where the Board finds some
compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the non-conforming use and
that the primary purpose in continuing the non-conforming use is not to
continue a monopoly;



      (5)   In the waiving or reduction of the parking and loading
requirements in any of the districts whenever the character or use of the
building is such as to make unnecessary the full provisions of the parking or
loading facilities, or where such regulations would impose an unreasonable
hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an
advantage or convenience;



      (6)   In the permitting of land within 300 feet of a multiple
dwelling to be improved for the parking spaces required in connection with a
multiple dwelling;



      (7)   In the determination of whether an industry should be
permitted within the M1 Light Industrial District or the M2 Heavy Industrial
District because of the methods by which it would be operated and because of
its effect upon uses in surrounding districts;



      (8)   In the extension or expansion of a non-conforming use on
the same or adjoining property to provide parking for employees and for
handicapped persons; and



      (9)   After application by a junk yard owner and review of the
request, the Board of Adjustment may grant an exception to the city’s junk
yard fence requirement. The Board shall consider the criteria set forth in §
117.021(A) of this code and shall have the power at any time after granting
such an exception, after notice and hearing, to revoke the exception and
require the junk yard owner to construct a fence in accordance with the
requirements set forth herein. The Board of Adjustment shall have no
jurisdiction to grant an exception unless all three of the criteria set forth
herein.



   (C)   Variations. To grant a variation in the following instances.



      (1)   In the yard requirements of any district where there are
unusual or practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying
out of these provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot, topographical
or other conditions provided, such variations will not seriously affect any
adjoining property or the general welfare.



      (2)   In the determination that a strict application of the
terms of this chapter relating to the construction, or alterations of
building or other structures, or use of land will impose upon the property
owner unusual and practical difficulties or particular hardship.



      (3)   The following are variance review guidelines.



         (a)   A variance is not the appropriate remedy for a
general condition.



         (b)   Self-inflicted hardships are not grounds for a
variance.



         (c)   Personal hardships are not grounds for a variance.
The hardship must relate to the physical character of the property.



         (d)   Economic conditions are not grounds for a variance
(solely).



         (e)   Hardships must be severe. A variation from the
strict application of the terms of this chapter shall be in harmony with its
general purpose and intent, and the Board shall be satisfied that a granting
of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant,
but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship.



         (f)   If granted, variance must not adversely affect the
neighborhood.



         (g)   All applicants must be treated fairly.



         (h)   Substantial justice will be done with the grant of
the variance.



      (4)   In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter.



   (D)   Home occupation special use permits. The Board shall approve
all home occupation special use applications. Refer to § 156.025 of this
chapter for requirements.



   (E)   Special uses. To grant a special use permit for uses listed in
§§ 156.550 through 156.552 of this chapter.



   (F)   Appeals, proposed exceptions. In considering all appeals and
all proposed exceptions or variations to this chapter, the Board shall,
before making any exceptions or variations from the ordinance in a specific
case, first determine:



      (1)   It will not impair an adequate supply of light and air
to adjacent property;



      (2)   It will not unreasonably increase the congestion in
public streets or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety;



      (3)   It will not unreasonably diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area; or



      (4)   It will not in any other respect impair the public
health, safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the city.



   (G)   Reserve of power. Nothing herein contained shall be construed
to give or grant to the Board the power or authority to alter or change this
chapter or the District Map, such power and authority being reserved to the
City Council in the manner hereinafter provided in the city code of
ordinances.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.623  APPEALS.



   (A)   Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality affected by
any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within
a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the City Clerk a notice of
appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is
taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Any person may appear
and testify at the hearing, either in person or by his or her agent or
attorney.



   (B)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the officer from whose decision or action the appeal is
taken certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed
that by reason of acts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board or by a court of record on application of notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.624  NOTICE AND FEE.



   (A)   The Board shall make no findings, except in a specific case
and after a public hearing conducted by the Board. The Board shall select a
reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and shall give due
notice thereof to the parties. The notice of the time and place of such
public hearing shall be published in a county publication of general
circulation in the city at least ten days previous to the hearing. Such
notice shall contain the address or location of the property for which the
variation or other ruling by the Board is sought, as well as a brief
description of the nature of the appeal.



   (B)   If a special use permit is requested a fee, set by resolution,
shall be paid to the City Clerk at the time of the notice of appeal is filed.
If a variance is requested, a fee, set by resolution, shall be paid to the
City Clerk at the time the notice of appeal is filed. Fees shall be credited
to the General Government Fund of the city.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.625  RELIEF.



   Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision
of the Board or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of
the city shall have recourse to such relief as is provided by statute.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.626  SMALL LOT EXCEPTION.



   Regardless of any provision to the contrary, set out above, the
city’s Board of Adjustment shall have no jurisdiction to grant either an
exception or variance concerning any small lot in the city.



(Ord. 14871, passed 4-12-2010)



§ 156.999  PENALTY.



   (A)   (1)   Any person, firm or corporation, who violates,
disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with or who resists the
enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined a fee,
set by resolution, for each offense. After a written notice of such
violation, each day that violation is permitted to exist beyond the
expiration of the time designated on said notice, shall constitute a separate
offense.



      (2)   In case any building or structure is erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or
any building, structure or land is used in violation of this chapter, the
Zoning Administrator, in addition to other remedies, may institute any proper
actions or proceedings in the name of the city, to prevent such unlawful
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion,
maintenance or use, to restrain, correct or abate such violations, to prevent
the occupancy of said building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal
act, conduct, business or use in or about said premises.



   (B)   Violations of the provisions of §§ 156.395 through 156.415
of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants
of special uses or variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. A person who
violates §§ 156.395 through 156.415 of this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined an amount
set by resolution or imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.



   (C)   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a municipal
infraction or civil penalty as permitted in this code of ordinances or cause
removal of such sign. The owner of the sign and/or sign structure or the
owner of the property upon which the sign is located shall pay any expense
incident to such removal. Failure to pay said costs may result in the
assessment of such costs against the property.
