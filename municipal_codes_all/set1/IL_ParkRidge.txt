PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Park Ridge, Illinois. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the ordinance included herein. 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the article, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 4-14-2 is Section 2, located in Chapter 14 of Article 4. 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1

The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross-references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

For example, an advertisement in a newspaper, church bulletin, or direct-mail piece is not "actively pursing an opportunity to establish an Economic Relationship" under this policy. Providing an estimate of costs for services, price list or rate to an individual is "actively pursing an opportunity to establish an Economic Relationship." If the individual then engages the services or places an order, an Economic Relationship is created. If the individual expressly declines the offer, and the City Official takes no further action, the City Official is no longer "actively pursing an opportunity to establish an Economic Relationship" with the individual. If the individual expressly declines the offer, and the City Official submits a new offer, the City Official is "actively pursing an opportunity to establish an Economic Relationship" with the individual. 
Business entity shall mean any organization or enterprise (operated for profit), including, but not limited to, a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, corporation, limited liability company, firm, business, trust, joint venture, syndicate or association.

Disclosure shall mean the filing, with the City Attorney, of a written statement that describes the economic relationship. 
Economic relationship shall mean any financial dealing, business relationship or client representation. This shall include any transaction or dealing of any kind or nature with a Petitioner, where the value of the goods, service or other benefit exchanged exceeds $150.00.

Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this State in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this State.

As used in this Chapter, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations.

Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this Chapter. For purposes of this Section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.

Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this Chapter shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the manner provided by the Department. 
B.  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this Chapter shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

B.  Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
C.  Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.  
2-7.1-6 - SEVERABILITY 
If any provision of this Chapter, or the application of any provision of this Chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall not affect other provisions of this Chapter, or their application, that can be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this Chapter.

2-9-1 - ESTABLISHMENT OF BUDGET POLICY 
There is hereby established in the City a budget policy which shall be implemented by the City Manager in the orderly preparation of an annual budget.  
2-9-2 - POWERS AND DUTIES OF CITY MANAGER IN IMPLEMENTING BUDGET POLICY 
The City Manager shall have the following powers and duties: 
A.  Permit, encourage, and establish the use of efficient planning, budgeting, auditing, reporting, accounting and other fiscal management procedures in all Municipal departments, commissions and boards. 
B.  Compile an annual budget in accordance with the following: 
1.  The City Manager will schedule and hold budget workshops during January, February, and March each year. The workshops will be special Finance Committee of the Whole meetings and will be structured to cover topics such as revenue projections, department personnel (salaries, benefits, pensions), department contracting and material, shared services, transfers, debt service, capital plan replacement funds and other topics the City Manager, Finance Director or City Council deem appropriate. At the first scheduled budget workshop, the City Manager will submit a summary of projected revenues and expenditures for the annual budget. At the conclusion of the budget workshops, the City Manager will compile the results into a final proposed budget for adoption by the City Council at the first City Council meeting in April. The budget upon which the vote is taken shall be a budget in which each individual fund is balanced (except equipment replacement funds), that is, for each individual fund, the sum of all revenues and funding sources (funding sources include one time revenue and fund transfers) for each individual fund is greater than or equal to the sum of all expenditures and funding uses (funding uses include operating expenditures, fund transfers, capital expenditures, debt service payments and all other expenditures including budgeted contingencies). 
If the difference between the sum of the revenue and funding sources and the sum of the expenditures and funding uses for any individual fund is negative, then certain specified fund balances or accounts may be used to bring that fund into balance. [6] 
Supplement A 
Sample List of Fund Balance Classification that can be used to balance an individual fund budget:

Tech Equipment Replacement FundUnrestricted Net Assets (Unrestricted net assets as of 4/30/11) 
Library Tech Equipment Replacement FundUnrestricted Net Assets (Unrestricted net assets as of 4/30/11) 
2.  If use of fund balance to balance the budget should cause the ending unassigned fund balance of the General Fund, or assigned fund balance of any Governmental Fund or the net unrestricted assets of any Enterprise Fund to fall below 90% of the Target Fund Balance, as described in Council Policy Statement 40, then a two-thirds vote of the Aldermen shall be required to approve the budget of such fund. The budget shall contain estimates of revenues available to the City for the fiscal year for which the budget is drafted, together with recommended expenditures for the City and all of the City's departments, commissions and boards. Revenue estimates and expenditure recommendations shall be presented in a manner which is in conformity with good fiscal management practices. The budget shall contain at the budget category level, actual or estimated revenue and expenditures for one year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the budget is prepared, long with two years' future projection. Each budget shall show the specific fund from which each anticipated expenditure should be made. The budget categories will include but not be limited to: revenue, regular salaries, overtime, medical/dental insurance, pension contributions, workers compensation, all other personnel, contractual services, commodities, capital, debt service, and transfers. 
3.  Revenue source changes shall include any rate or fee schedule change, additions of new revenues, and deletions of revenue sources or other major financing policy issues. 
4.  Once the budget is approved, revenues and expenditures shall be monitored on a regular basis and adjustments made in spending if revenues are less than projected. The City Manager shall provide monthly reports to the City Council and the City Council shall review and act on all significant proposed spending adjustments that result in service changes. 
5.  Examine all books and records of all Municipal departments, commissions, and boards, which relate to monies received by the City, City departments, and commissions and boards, and paid out by the City, City departments, commissions and boards, debts and accounts receivable, amounts owed by or to the City, City departments, commissions and boards. 
D.  Obtain such additional information from the City, City departments, commissions and boards as may be useful for purposes of compiling a City budget, such information to be furnished by the City, City departments, commissions and boards in the form required by the City Manager. Any department, commission or board which refuses to make such information as is requested of it available to the City Manager shall not be permitted to make expenditures under any subsequent budget for the City until such City department, commission or board shall comply in full with the request of the City Manager. 
E.  Establish and maintain such procedures as shall insure that no expenditures are made by the City, City departments, commissions or boards except as authorized by the budget.

(Ord. 2012-04, 1-16-2012)  
2-9-4 - PASSAGE OF ANNUAL BUDGET, EFFECT 
Passage of the annual budget by the corporate authorities shall be in lieu of passage of an appropriation ordinance. The annual budget need not be published except in a manner provided in Section 2-9-8 herein. The annual budget shall be adopted by the corporate authorities before the beginning of the fiscal year to which it applies. Subsequent to the passage of the budget, an ordinance shall establish the property tax assessment provided for in the approved budget.  
2-9-5 - CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT, REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT FUND 
Monies may be accumulated in a separate fund for the purpose or purposes of specific capital improvements, repair and/or replacements of specific types of municipal equipment or other tangible property both real and personal, to be designated as the "Capitol Improvement, Repair or Replacement Fund". Expenditures from the Capital Improvement, Repair or Replacement Fund shall be budgeted in the fiscal year in which the capital improvement, repair or replacement will occur. As of fiscal year ending 2012, the City maintains two capital repair or replacement funds: the Technology Replacement Fund; and the Motor Equipment Replacement Fund. 
(Ord. 2012-04, 1-16-2012)  
2-9-6 - REVISION OF ANNUAL BUDGET 
If new elected officials are elected and then are installed during the first 30 days of a fiscal year, the corporate authorities may, by majority vote, revise the annual budget by deleting departments or objects or by adding to or subtracting from departments or objects. An example of a Department is 1021Administration. An example of an object is 910000Regular Salaries. An expense line item within the budget is defined as dollar amount budgeted using a combination of a Fund (ex. 100), a Department (ex. 1021), and an Object Code (ex. 910000). An example of the complete line item is 100-1021-910000. 
During the fiscal year, the City Manager may revise the Expense/Expenditure budget for any individual Fund only as follows: by (1) deleting funding for departments or objects; (2) adding funding to departments or objects; or (3) changing departments or objects. Such revisions shall follow the procedure set forth below: 
If a purchase order encumbrance or a manual journal entry causes the respective total fund-department-object budget amount to be exceeded, the following procedure will be applied: [The MUNIS report, "YTD Budget Report" will be used to monitor compliance (see report example below) 
1.  Determine if this or another already existing purchase order encumbrance can be reduced. If such a purchase order reduction can be achieved, such that the total fund-department-object budget is no longer exceeded, the reduction should be processed and a budget transfer is not required. 
2.  If reduction cannot be accomplished pursuant to (1) above, then a budget transfer between or among line items is required. The budget transfer must cause the total fund-department-object budget to equal or exceed the total fund-department- object encumbered incurred expenses. (The column labeled "Remaining" in the YTD budget report must be greater than or equal to zero.) 
3.  If a budget transfer is required as in (2) above but a line item to move the funds "From" cannot be identified and/or is not available, then Council Policy Statement 21Unbudgeted Expenditures, which governs the transfers from Contingency Funds, shall apply. If no Contingency Funds are budgeted or available, a revision of the budget must be presented to and approved by the Committee of the Whole at a Finance Committee meeting and approved by the City Council.

(Ord. 2012-04, 1-16-2012)  
2-9-8 - PUBLIC INSPECTION, NOTICE AND HEARING ON BUDGET 
The corporate authorities shall make the tentative annual budget conveniently available to public inspection for at least ten days prior to passage of the annual budget, by publication in such form as the corporate authorities may prescribe. Not less than one week after the publication of the tentative annual budget, and prior to final action on the budget the corporate authorities shall hold at least one public hearing on the tentative annual budget after which hearing or hearings the tentative budget may be further revised and passed without further inspection, notice or hearing. Notice of this hearing shall be given at least one week prior to the time of the hearing by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the Municipality.  
2-9-9 - CONTRACT AWARDS AND APPROVALS 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish the legal standards for the procurement of goods and services. 
B.  City Council Approval. Except as set forth in subsection C, all purchases of goods and services must be approved by the City Council and accomplished pursuant to the methods set forth in either paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of subsection D. 
C.  Purchase Exceptions. As the sole exceptions to the requirement of subsection B above, the following are authorized to approve expenditures in the amounts set forth below: 
1.  Department Head$2,500.00 or less. 
2.  Finance Director$10,000.00 or less. 
3.  City Manager$20,000.00 or less. 
4.  City Council$20,000.01 or more. 
5.  Finance CommitteeSole Source Procurement. Not less than five business days before the Finance Committee considers a request for sole source procurement of a specified good or service, the City shall publish notice of intent to use sole source procurement for a specified good or service. The Finance Committee may grant approval for sole source procurement, by two-thirds majority approval of all Alderman, if any of the following criteria apply: 
a.  Only one known source exists for supplies or services as determined by documented research; 
b.  No other reasonable alternative source exists that meets the agency requirements; 
c.  Only one source meets the business needs of the agency/state (e.g., compatibility, unique feature to meet state's business need, etc.); and 
d.  Procurement of public utility services. 
Prior to presenting the request to the Finance Committee, the Department requesting the sole source procurement shall prepare a fact-based, written justification for the Finance Committee to review that addresses each applicable criteria set forth above. 
Purchasing as set forth in subsections 14 above, may be accomplished only in accordance with the following: 
a.  The annual budget provides for such purchase; 
b.  It is done pursuant to one of the selection methods set forth in subsection D; and 
c.  Procurement is not artificially divided in order to qualify for such purchasing. 
D.  Source Selection Methods. Selection of a source or sources for goods and services must be accomplished in one of the following methods: 
1.  Invitation to Bid. When the specifications are readily understood and the product and market are well known and readily obtainable, this is the preferred method of selecting a source of goods and services for the City. 
2.  Request for Proposal (RFP). Requests for proposals may be used as an alternative to an invitation to bid when factors other than price are a necessary consideration. Such factors may include service, rapidly changing technology, the experience of the staff and/or potential vendors or other matters of significance to management or the City Council. This method of selection requires sealed competitive proposals in the same manner as an Invitation to Bid. However, no contract will be formed or awarded pursuant to an RFP until the staff has submitted a written recommendation to the City Manager or the City Council, whichever is required by this Section 2-9-9. 
3.  Informal Solicitation. An informal competitive solicitation process may be used for purchases of goods and services where it is not anticipated that the expenditure will exceed twenty thousand dollars $20,000. The difference between this method and those set forth in (1) and (2), is that the solicitation may be made by direct contact rather than publication for bids. No contract may be awarded pursuant to this method unless at least three bids are received. In all instances, the normal procurement approval process must be followed. 
4.  Request for Qualifications (RFQ). Requests for qualifications may be used when a particular service; i.e. legal, architectural or engineering, requires a high degree of professional training and experience. 
5.  Fuel Purchase Agreements. It is recognized that the purchase of fuel for city vehicles must be purchased many times throughout the course of a fiscal year. The City does not have the storage capacity to make such purchases on an annual basis and the price for commodities may fluctuate significantly throughout the year. For this reason, the Director of Public Works may make such fuel purchases as are, from time to time, reasonably necessary and in the best economic interests of the City. Such purchases may exceed $20,000.00. The Director must solicit proposals from not less than three sources and must report such purchases, in writing, to the City Manager within 24 hours of the purchase. The City Council may by majority vote, at any time remove such authority from the Director without prior amendment to this Code. 
6.  Declaration of Emergency. Upon a written declaration of an emergency, and with the written consent of the Mayor, the City Manager is authorized to expend such funds as may be necessary to address an immediate and present danger to the public health, safety or welfare or other circumstance that presents the potential for substantial loss to the City or its residents. If the Mayor is unavailable and the expenditure is $50,000.00 or less, the written declaration and approval of any two of the following: City Manager, Police Chief, Fire Chief or Public Works Director; shall be sufficient. If the Mayor is unavailable and the expenditure does or is anticipated to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), then the written declaration and approval of the City Manager and any two of the above stated persons is required. 
E.  Rules for Bid Acceptance. 
1.  Rejections. In all cases, the City Council shall have the right to reject any and all bids and to reject any and all staff award recommendations. 
2.  Sole Bidder. When only one bid is received, an award may be made to such bidder only if it is determined that: a) the price submitted is fair and reasonable; b) other prospective bidders had a reasonable opportunity to respond; and c) the bidder is both responsive and responsible. A two-thirds vote of the City Council will be required to approve such an award. In making this determination, the Council may consider whether or not there is adequate time for a re-bidding. 
3.  Contracts for Greater than 12 Months. Subject to state law, award of a contract for goods or services with an initial term of more than one year will also require a two-thirds vote of the City Council for approval. However, an option to renew or extend a pre-existing contract for up to one year may be approved by a simple majority vote, provided that the conditions of renewal or extension were included in the original bid solicitation and funds were available for the first fiscal period at the time of the original contract award. 
4.  Bidding Alternate Goods and Services. Bids that offer equivalent but alternative and more economical services, supplies or materials than those set forth in the original specification are encouraged by the City. When an alternative appears to be more advantageous to the City than the original specification, re-bidding may be recommended with the modified specifications. 
F.  Waiver of Competitive Selection for Contracts over $20,000. With the approval of 2/3 of the City Council, contracts which by their nature are not amenable to the competitive selection process, including the following, may be entered into without competitive bids or proposals: 
1.  Utility services, including electric, gas, water or telecommunication services. 
2.  A purchase of goods or services from another governmental entity. 
3.  A purchase of goods or services through a recognized governmental cooperative joint purchasing program (i.e. State of Illinois, Northwest Municipal Conference, M.A.B.A.S., etc.) 
G.  Sole source procurement in excess of $2,500.00 for non-emergency purchases of goods and services is not permitted. 
H.  Consistency with City Policy on Procurement Rules and Requirements. 
Unless specifically stated otherwise by an appropriate resolution or ordinance; all procurement shall be consistent with the City of Park Ridge Procurement Rules and Requirements as from time to time may be published by the Director of Finance and approved by the City Council. In the case of discrepancy between such rules and this Code, this Code shall prevail. 
(2014-62, 11-17-2014; Ord. No. 2016-53 , § 2, 7-18-2016; Ord. No. 2018-19 , § 2(Exh. A) 6-4-2018)  
2-9-10 - PAYMENT OF BILLS 
All bills for goods or services rendered to the City shall be paid within 90 days of receipt unless within that time period the vendor is notified that a dispute exists as to the quality or quantity of goods or services furnished or the amount due therefor, or unless the contract for furnishing such goods or services otherwise provides. Whenever reasonably possible, such bills shall be timely paid so as to take advantage of any price reduction for prompt payment. No interest or other late payment penalty shall be added to such bills.  
CHAPTER 10 - DISPOSITION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY 
SECTION 
 
2-10-1 - DISPOSITION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY 
All items of personal property no longer necessary for use in the conduct of the business of government of the City shall be disposed of by one of the following methods: 
A.  Traded in as part of the purchase price for a new item of similar goods or equipment. 
B.  Sold at public sale, either by open public auction, Internet auction, or competitive sealed bid, and the Finance Director, or his/her designee, is authorized to arrange for the public sale. Notice of the public sale shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Park Ridge or metropolitan Chicago, by use of the Internet, by mailing to individuals or firms who have requested notice, or by any other means judged by the Finance Director or his/her designee to be in the best interests of the City. 
C.  Scrapped when investigation as to the probable worth of an item shows that the item has either no current value or the probable current value is exceeded by the costs to be incurred in the public sale of the item. An item of personal property may also be scrapped if it has been unsuccessfully offered for public sale. 
D.  Transferred to another public or governmental agency, after determination that the item has no probable current worth in accordance with Section 2-10-2C. 
(Ord. 2004-137, 12-20-2004)  
2-10-2 - DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY POSSESSED BY POLICE DEPARTMENT 
A.  This Section is applicable to all personal property of which possession is transferred to the Police Department of the City under circumstances supporting a reasonable belief that such property was abandoned, lost or stolen or otherwise illegally possessed except property seized during a search and retained and ultimately returned, destroyed or otherwise disposed of pursuant to order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
B.  Property believed to be abandoned, lost or stolen or otherwise illegally possessed shall be retained in the custody of the Police Chief of the City who shall make reasonable inquiry and efforts to identify and notify the owner or other person entitled to possession thereof and shall return the property after such person provides reasonable and satisfactory proof of his ownership or right to possession and reimburses the City for all reasonable expenses of such custody. 
C.  If the identity or location of the owner or other person entitled to possession of the property has not been ascertained within six months after the Police Department obtained such possession, the Police Chief shall effectuate the sale of the property for cash at public sale. Property offered but not sold at such public sale may be offered and sold at a subsequent public sale. 
D.  Proceeds of the sale of property at public sale, less reimbursement to the City of reasonable expenses of custody thereof, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the City. 
E.  The owner or other person entitled to possession of such property may claim and recover possession of the property any time before its sale at public sale upon providing reasonable and satisfactory proof of ownership or right to possession and reimbursing the City for all reasonable expenses of custody thereof. 
F.  No person shall be responsible for consequent damages to another occasioned by an act or omission in compliance with this Chapter.

The Appointing Authority may conduct an interview with the candidate or member and consider any documents or records presented by the candidate or member as part of the individualized assessment. 
(Ord. No. 2016-03 , 2(Exh. A), 1-18-2016)  
4-17-6 - ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENT 
Should any member become incapable of attending at least 75% of all meetings for such Board or Commission, this may be considered by the Appointing Authority as cause for removal in the manner described in Sections 3.1-35-10 or 11-13-3 of the Illinois Municipal Code, or as otherwise applicable.

2.  Applicability. As of the effective date of these Subdivision Regulations, no person, firm or corporation shall divide, further divide or otherwise alter the boundaries of any lot or parcel of land within the City of Park Ridge except in compliance with the provisions of these Regulations. To further clarify the applicability of these Regulations, the following provisions shall apply:

Nothing in these Regulations shall require the subdivision of improved lots or parcels where such improved lots or parcels have been created prior to the effective date of these Regulations by any means with the exception of cases involving demolition as provided for in Section 1.D.2.a, above. 
3.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Regulations shall be held to be minimum requirements to meet the stated purpose and intent of these Regulations.

These Regulations shall apply to all subdivisions, as herein defined, situated in the unincorporated portions of Cook County which are located entirely or in part within one and one half miles of the nearest corporate limits of the City to the extent that such territory is specifically addressed in the Comprehensive Plan. In the event of an overlap between the one and one half mile extraterritorial jurisdiction of Park Ridge and that of a neighboring municipality, these Regulations shall then apply to subdivisions located entirely within an area situated between the nearest corporate limits of the City and one half the distance between said nearest corporate limits and the nearest corporate limits of the neighboring municipality. 
F.  Administration. The Director shall administer these Regulations. All applications, fees, maps and documents pertaining to subdivision approval shall be submitted to the Department for processing and, where appropriate, referred to the Commission.

b.  The consolidation of two or more lots, parcels or tracts of land, either in whole or in part, into a single lot of record, when all of the properties are under the same ownership. 
With respect to the above, an Administrative Subdivision is permissible only if: (i) no non-conformities are created with respect to these regulations; (ii) the entire length of the subdivision fronts on an existing street; and (iii) there are no exceptions or variations required except as to parkway trees, sidewalks or existing substandard streets and rights-of-way. 
H.  Minor Subdivisions. A Final Plat creating not more than three lots of record shall be approved by the Commission and the City Council without a Preliminary Plat review. Preliminary Plat review may be required upon the recommendation of the Director. 
I.  Subdivisions of Record. Any plat of subdivision, approved by the Commission or the Director and submitted to the Cook County Recorder of Deeds for recording and registration prior to effective date of the ordinance approving these Regulations, shall be accepted as valid and no further approval by the Commission shall be required. 
J.  Non-Complying Parcels and Subdivisions.

Furthermore, no building permit shall be issued by the City, its Building Administrator or other City officers or inspectors for the purpose of improving any parcel of land in a land partition, as defined herein, unless and until said parcel becomes and is one or more lots in an approved and recorded or registered subdivision as herein defined. 
K.  Variations and Exceptions. 
1.  Administrative Subdivisions. The Director shall have the authority to approve variations or exceptions with respect to parkway trees, sidewalks, and existing substandard streets and rights-of-way in Administrative Subdivisions. In all other instances, variations and exceptions shall be administered as set forth in 2 below. 
2.  All Other Subdivisions. The Commission may recommend and, pursuant to Section 2.I, herein, the City Council may grant variations to the standards and requirements of these Regulations, in harmony with their general purpose and intent, in cases where there are particular difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of said standards and requirements. In considering requests for variations, the Commission may recommend and the City Council may impose such conditions and safeguards as are deemed necessary to protect the public interest or the character of the neighborhood. The City Council may require a guarantee or bond to assure compliance. 
In accordance with Section 11.11.B.5 of the Zoning Ordinance, the Commission may also recommend modifications to the standards and requirements herein in the case of a Planned Development undertaken pursuant to said Ordinance where, in the opinion of the Commission, such modifications are necessary and desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed Planned Development. ;hn0 (Ord.

(Ord. No. 2003-8, 2-3-2003)  
6-2-3 - SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS 
A.  Scope of Design Standards. Every subdivision shall conform with the design standards and principles contained in this Section. No person, firm or corporation shall subdivide land, except in compliance with these requirements. In applying these design standards, the following general principles shall govern: 
1.  Every subdivision shall conform to the policies and principles generally exhibited in the Comprehensive Plan including, but not necessarily limited to, the Transportation Plan Map. Furthermore, no subdivision shall be approved, which is not in full compliance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and all other applicable ordinances, statutes and regulations. 
2.  The standards and requirements outlined in these Regulations shall be considered the minimum for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare of the City. 
3.  All portions of a tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots, streets, public lands or other proposed uses, so that remnants and landlocked areas shall not be created. 
4.  No subdivision shall be approved, unless adequate access exists over approved streets to the tract being subdivided, or unless such access will be provided by the applicant. Furthermore, no subdivision shall be approved if the tract to be subdivided is considered by the Commission to be unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or improper drainage, geological structure, topography or any other feature harmful to the health, safety and general welfare of present and future residents of Park Ridge. 
B.  General Subdivision Layout and Design. 
1.  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all proposed streets within a subdivision shall be considered with respect to their relationship to existing and planned (platted) streets, topographic conditions, public convenience and safety and appropriate relationship to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. 
2.  The overall street plan for any subdivision shall provide vehicular access to the subdivision by a public or private street(s) connected to the City's existing street system. 
3.  Street jogs are prohibited with centerline offsets of less than 100 feet. 
4.  Half streets are hereby prohibited. In the case of an existing half street, whenever the property constituting the undedicated portion of said half street is contiguous to a tract to be subdivided and owned by the applicant of the subdivision, the undedicated half of the street shall be indicated on the plat of subdivision for dedication to the public. 
5.  Where not indicated to the contrary in the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of all streets within a subdivision shall either: 
a.  Provide for the logical continuation or appropriate projection of existing or planned (platted) streets adjoining the tract to be subdivided; or 
b.  Where topography or other conditions make continuation or projection of existing streets unnecessary or impracticable, such arrangement of streets shall conform to a general area plan approved by the Commission. 
6.  New local streets in residential neighborhoods shall be laid out in such a way so as to discourage through traffic. 
7.  Where a subdivision abuts an existing or proposed arterial street or other streets carrying heavy traffic, or where said subdivision contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Commission may require local access or frontage streets, reversed frontage with screen planting contained in a non access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment, including wider pavement widths, as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential or other properties and separation of local and through traffic. 
8.  Where a subdivision borders or contains a railroad or limited access highway right-of-way, the Commission may require a frontage street approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way, and at such a distance, as required for appropriate use of intervening land, if any, and with due regard for the requirements of future approach grades and grade separations. 
9.  A subdivision plat, involving new or existing streets crossing railroad tracks, shall provide adequate right-of-way and slope easements for the construction of an underpass or overpass. 
10.  No street intersection shall include more than four street approaches. 
11.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect another at less than 60 degrees provided, however, that other arrangements for the smooth merging of traffic shall be permitted where the total effect on the intersection is to reduce traffic hazards and to provide for smooth traffic flow at the intersection as a whole. 
12.  Property lines at the intersection of two local streets or of a local street with a cul de sac or an alley shall be curved with a minimum radius of 25 feet. Property lines at all collector and arterial street intersections shall be curved with a minimum radius of 50 feet. 
13.  A tangent with a minimum length of 100 feet shall be introduced between reverse curves on all arterial and collector streets. 
14.  When connecting street lines deflect from each other, they shall be connected by a curve with a sufficient radius to insure a sight distance adequate for visibility and safety. The size of the radius shall be determined by the City Engineer after consideration of the character of the street and the types and speed of traffic anticipated. 
15.  If a portion of a tract is not subdivided, suitable access shall be provided for street openings to allow for eventual subdivision of the entire tract. 
16.  Dead end streets are prohibited, except as stubs to adjoining tracts. Where stub streets are constructed abutting unsubdivided acreage, temporary easements for turnarounds shall be provided at the boundary lines of the subdivision, and appropriate arrangements shall be made for those portions of the turnarounds outside of street rights-of-way to revert to abutting owners, at such time as the street is extended. 
17.  Private streets are prohibited in all subdivisions unless specifically authorized by the Commission. Where private streets are authorized, the applicant shall be required to construct the streets in full compliance with specifications and the design standards contained in these Regulations. 
C.  Street and Alley Design Standards. 
1.  Street Classification. All streets within or abutting a subdivision shall be classified either as an arterial, collector, local or cul de sac street. Streets appearing on the Transportation Plan Map of the Comprehensive Plan shall be classified in complete accordance with the Map. Where streets are not referred to in the Comprehensive Plan, the appropriate classification shall be as determined by the Commission after consideration is given to the proposed density and/or land use of the property adjacent to the streets or within the tract to be subdivided. 
2.  Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths for Proposed Streets and Alleys. The following minimum standards shall apply to all proposed streets and alleys within or abutting a subdivision. All streets and alleys shall be fully paved and, in no case, shall the right-of-way or pavement widths of any proposed street or alley within or abutting a subdivision be less than the following: 
Classification 	Minimum 
Right-of-Way 
Width(feet) 	Minimum Pavement 
Width (feet) 
Excluding Curb/Gutter 
a. Arterial 	80 	44 (plus turn lanes, as required) 
b. Collector 	80 	36 
c. Local 	66 	32 
d. Cul de sac 	100 	80 
e. Alley 	20 	16 
 
3.  Grade Standards for Proposed Streets, Alleys and Parking Lots. No proposed street, alley or parking lot within or abutting a subdivision shall exceed the following grades: 
Classification 	Maximum Grade (percent) 
a. Arterial 	6.0 
b. Collector 	8.0 
c. Local 	8.0 
d. Cul-de-sac 	8.0 
e. Alley 	10.0 
f. Parking Lot 	6.0 
 
4.  Drainage Standards for Proposed Streets and Alleys. For adequate drainage, the minimum grade for a proposed street or alley within or abutting a subdivision shall not be less than one half of one percent, or as approved by the City Engineer, in accordance with acceptable engineering standards. 
A normal crown shall be provided on all streets and alleys, not super-elevated, of one-quarter inch per foot straight slope extending in a cross section from the edge of pavement to the centerline, symmetrical to the center. 
5.  Design Standards for Existing Streets. Whenever a subdivision contains lots which front on an existing arterial, collector, local or cul de sac street, the applicant shall be required to conform to the same design standards required for proposed streets as set forth in Section 3.C.1 through 3.C.3 above, except that the Commission may grant, subject to City Council approval, a variation to this requirement, in accordance with Section 1.I, Variations, where the reconstruction of the existing streets would be inconsistent with the character and development pattern of the surrounding neighborhood; or where, in the opinion of the Commission, such reconstruction would cause severe and unnecessary hardship to the applicant. 
6.  Dedication. Rights-of-way intended for streets, pedestrian ways, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, trees or any other use involving maintenance by a public agency, shall be dedicated by fee ownership to public use and shown as such by the registered engineer or land surveyor preparing the Final Plat, on which the right-of-way is established. 
7.  Arterial Streets. Arterial streets are subject to the necessary control of entrances, exits and curbs. 
D.  Street Names. No street name shall be used which duplicates, or is likely to be confused with the name of an existing or planned (platted) street. Proposed streets, which are in alignment with or are projections of existing or planned (platted) streets, shall bear the same name as those streets. 
E.  Alleys. 
1.  Residential Areas. As a general rule, alleys shall not be permitted in subdivisions located in residentially zoned districts. However, where alleys are needed, due to unusual and extreme conditions of topography, traffic flow or access, the Commission may require the construction of alleys. 
2.  Business Areas. Where the Commission determines that the public interest will be served by requiring alleys in subdivisions located in commercially zoned districts for the purpose of facilitating off street parking or loading, alleys shall be required in accordance with the design standards in these Regulations. 
3.  Dead End Alleys. In no event shall dead end alleys be permitted. 
4.  Alley Access. No alley shall serve as the principal means of access for any lot within a subdivision. All such lots shall front upon a street. 
F.  Cul de Sacs. No cul de sac streets shall be longer than 600 feet from the nearest intersecting street and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a curb radius of at least 60 feet. Between the street and the circle there shall be a 25-foot reverse radius. 
G.  Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks, not less than five feet wide, shall be required abutting the property lines adjacent to all streets to provide for adequate and safe pedestrian circulation and access to schools, parks, shopping, employment, transportation and other community facilities. Pedestrian ways shall not be less than five feet in width and shall be located within a public right-of-way of not less than ten feet in width. 
H.  Parkways. Along each side of a street within or adjacent to a subdivision, a landscaped parkway shall be provided containing a minimum width of ten feet measured between the curb and sidewalk. 
I.  Block Standards. 
1.  Lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use anticipated; 
b.  Zoning requirements where applicable to lot sizes and dimensions; 
c.  The need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street and pedestrian traffic; and 
d.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
2.  Block lengths shall not exceed 1,400 feet nor be less than 300 feet, except where alternate designs are approved by the Commission. 
3.  Blocks shall normally be designed with sufficient width to provide two tiers of lots. However, the Commission may approve a more flexible block width design where, due to the existence of heavy traffic, railroad tracks, streams, drainage courses, multifamily housing, commercial areas, schools, churches or other intense land uses, a two-tier block design is not appropriate. 
4.  For blocks longer than 600 feet, the Commission may require pedestrian ways if deemed essential to provide reasonable and safe pedestrian circulation and access. 
J.  Lot Standards. 
1.  Lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and the type of development and use contemplated. 
2.  All lot dimensions shall be in full conformance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance for the zoning district(s) in which the subdivision is located. 
3.  Where not stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance, lot dimensions for subdivisions located in business districts shall be adequate to accommodate off street parking and service facilities required by the type of use and development anticipated. 
4.  Double frontage and reversed frontage residential lots shall, in general, be avoided except where essential to provide residential separation from arterial streets or to overcome other disadvantages of orientation or topography. 
5.  Corner lots shall be considered as having frontage on both streets. All corner lots shall be sufficiently wide to allow for the erection of buildings and structures that observe the minimum front yard setback and corner side yard from both streets. 
6.  Where utility or other easements are involved, lot lines shall be so arranged with respect to the easements, so as to permit efficient installation of the utilities without unnecessary irregularities in alignment. 
7.  Each lot shall abut on a private or dedicated public street. 
8.  All side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial to the front lot line and the abutting street line. 
K.  Building Setback Lines. Building setback lines shall appear on each lot shown on a plat of subdivision. The building setback line, indicating the minimum front yard setback for a lot shall be drawn in accordance with the front yard setback stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance for the zoning district in which the lot is located. 
In the case of corner lots, the setback line indicating the minimum corner side yard setback shall be drawn in accordance with the setback stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance for the front yard setback of the lot. 
L.  Easements. An easement shall be provided for public utilities, as defined herein, adjacent to the rear lot line within each lot of a subdivision. The minimum right-of-way width of the easement shall be ten feet. 
(Ord. No. 2003-8, 2-3-2003)  
6-2-4 - REQUIRED PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS 
A.  Purpose and Scope. 
1.  The purpose of this Section is to delineate the public improvement and related installations that shall be required of the applicant, as condition of Final Plat approval. 
2.  All construction shall be completed in accordance with specifications, in a manner acceptable to the Commission and other applicable City departments and officials. 
3.  Whenever existing public improvements located within or abutting a subdivision are determined by the City Engineer to be deteriorated or not in conformity to specifications, the public improvements shall be reconstructed or replaced by the applicant in such a manner so as to fully conform with the specifications. 
4.  All required public improvements in these Regulations shall be installed and constructed by the developer who shall pay all costs involved in installation, construction, inspections and testing, including the costs for resident engineering services. 
5.  Approval of the Final Plat by the Commission or the Director does not constitute permission to construct required public improvements. Appropriate permits must first be obtained from the City before construction may commence. 
B.  Streets and Alleys. Streets and alleys shall be graded, surfaced and paved in accordance with applicable specifications and in full compliance with the design standards in Section 3 of these Regulations. Curbs and gutters shall be built in accordance with the specifications along all streets. 
In accordance with Section 3.C.5 of these Regulations, a subdivision containing a lot(s) which fronts on an existing street, shall be required to dedicate appropriate right-of-way (if needed), and reconstruct and improve the existing street in full compliance with the specifications and design standards, unless the Commission grants a variation to this requirement in accordance with Section 1.I, above, subject to City Council approval. 
C.  Sidewalks and Curb Cuts. Sidewalks, curb cuts and driveway aprons shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications and design standards in Section 3 of these Regulations. Pedestrian crosswalks shall be required by the Commission, where deemed essential to provide interior circulation and access to schools, parks, and other community facilities. 
Where the City Engineer finds that sidewalks, other than those located at the edges of streets, would provide safe, logical and convenient routing of pedestrian traffic, the sidewalks, constructed in a manner appropriate to their purpose, may be required by the Commission. 
D.  Street Name Signs and Street Lights. Street name signs shall be installed in accordance with appropriate specifications at all street intersections. At intersections, there shall be at least two such street signs. 
Street lights, where required by the Commission, shall be installed in all subdivisions in accordance with appropriate specifications. The applicant shall pay all costs involved in installation and all maintenance and operation costs incurred until said street lights are formally accepted by the City, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Regulations. 
E.  Parkway Trees. Parkway trees shall be planted in the parkways, along both sides of all streets within or adjacent to a subdivision. Tree planting and parkway landscaping shall be performed in accordance with appropriate specifications. The species, quantity, size and location of parkway trees shall be approved by the Commission or the Director, upon the recommendation of the City Forester. 
F.  Sewers. Each lot within a subdivision shall be provided with a connection to a sewer system to be constructed, where necessary, by the applicant. The required sewer system shall be connected to the City's existing sewer system at a point approved by the City Engineer. Every sanitary sewer system within a subdivision shall be designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with appropriate specifications, and the applicant shall be responsible for paying to the City all related fees, charges and assessments as set forth in the specifications. 
G.  Storm Drainage Facilities 
1.  In all subdivisions, the applicant shall provide storm drains, culverts, drainage-ways or other improvements, as may be required to collect and dispose of all water originating on or flowing across the property to be subdivided, without inundating or damaging neighboring streets, lots or properties. All storm drainage systems shall be designed in accordance with appropriate specifications. 
2.  Wherever the City Engineer determines natural surface drainage to be inadequate, the applicant shall construct a storm drainage system, with catch basins appropriately spaced along the streets, and within the rear yard of each lot in the subdivision. 
3.  The applicant, in designing a storm drainage system for a subdivision, shall consider the present and future expected runoff from the surrounding watershed area, and shall submit to the City Engineer a certification by a Registered Engineer stating that all proposed storm drainage facilities are adequately designed to safely handle surface drainage from the surrounding watershed area. If required by the City Engineer, larger storm sewers, than those needed to serve the immediate subdivision, shall be installed. 
H.  Water Supply. Each lot within a subdivision shall be provided with a connection to a water supply system to be constructed, where necessary, by the applicant. Such a system shall be designed so as to adequately handle the water supply needs for the type of development proposed, and related to the existing and potential surrounding development areas so as to form a logical part of a coordinated public water system minimizing potential water supply problems for the general area. The water supply system may also require appropriately located fire hydrants, if the City Engineer finds the existing fire protection system to be insufficient within the immediate area. Additional fire hydrants shall be connected to the City's existing water main system at a point(s) approved by the City Engineer. Every water supply system within a subdivision, including required fire hydrants, shall be designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with Specifications, and the applicant shall be responsible for paying to the City all related fees, charges and assessments as set forth in said Specifications. 
I.  Parks, Open Space and Other Dedications.

i.  The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot; or 
ii.  The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot, formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
(i)  Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive non erosive slope toward a watercourse. 
(j)  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of water tight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
(k)  The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
(l)  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building improved to 50% or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
2.  Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an Appropriate Use. 
3.  Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the construction of an Appropriate Use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of Section 6-3-8 of this Chapter: 
(a)  Preservation of Flood Conveyance, so as Not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
i.  Designated floodway conveyance. "K" = (1.486/n)(AR 2/3 ) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York) 
ii.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non vegetative land cover. 
iii.  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(1)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
(2)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
(3)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
(4)  Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
(5)  All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
(b)  Preservation of Floodway Storage so as Not to Increase Downstream Flooding. 
i.  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. 
ii.  Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost. 
iii.  Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. 
iv.  The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
v.  If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. 
vi.  There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure. 
(c)  Preservation of Floodway Velocities so as Not to Increase Stream Erosion or Flood Heights. 
i.  For all Appropriate Uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
ii.  In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip rap or other design measures. 
(d)  Construction of New Bridges or Culvert Crossings and Roadway Approaches. 
i.  The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
ii.  If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver. 
(1)  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in Section 6-3-4 of this Chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation procedures. 
(2)  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per Section 6-3-6B4(b). 
(3)  Velocity increases must be mitigated per Section 6-3-6B4(c). 
(4)  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.

(6)  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per Section 6-3-6B4(h). 
(e)  Reconstruction or Modification of Existing Bridges, Culverts, and Approach Roads. 
i.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
ii.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
iii.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
(f)  On Stream Structures Built for the Purpose of Backing Up Water. 
i.  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
ii.  A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. 
iii.  All dams and impoundment structures as defined in Section 6-3-1 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(1)  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
(2)  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
(3)  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre sedimentation basin. 
(4)  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
(5)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 6-3-6. 
(g)  Flood Proofing of Existing Habitable, Residential and Commercial Structures. 
i.  If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. 
ii.  Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
(h)  Excavation in the Floodway. 
i.  When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other Appropriate Uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. 
ii.  The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(1)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; 
(2)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and 
(3)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of streamlength shall be used. 
(4)  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
(i)  If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
i.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
ii.  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
iii.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
(1)  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
(2)  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
(3)  One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
(4)  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
(5)  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(6)  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
(7)  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
(8)  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
(9)  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
(10)  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
(11)  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
iv.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 6-3-6. 
(j)  Seeding and Stabilization Plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
(k)  Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
i.  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
ii.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
iii.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
iv.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or re established, where possible, along existing channels (See 6-3-6B4(p)). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
v.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
(l)  Public Flood Control Projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
(m)  General Criteria for Analysis of Flood Elevations. 
i.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in Section 6-3-4, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
ii.  If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet: 
(1)  The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and, 
(2)  Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
iii.  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
(n)  Conditional Letter of Map Revision. 
i.  If the Appropriate Use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. 
ii.  The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
iii.  In the case of non government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. 
iv.  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. 
v.  After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. 
(o)  Professional Engineer's Supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
(p)  For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
i.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
ii.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an Appropriate Use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
(q)  After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an Appropriate Use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans. 
4.  Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State Review. For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway. 
(a)  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to Section 6-3-6B4(d).

(f)  Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood profiles. 
(g)  Projects in public bodies of water. 
5.  Other Permits. 
(a)  In addition to the other requirements of this Chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. 
(b)  No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated this responsibility to the City. 
6.  Permits for Dams 
(a)  Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in Section 6-3-1 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam.

iv.  Overhead utility lines shall be constructed above the estimated 100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low chord of an existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No supporting towers shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so as to not catch debris. 
v.  Disturbance of streamside vegetation shall be kept to minimum during construction to prevent erosion and sedimentation. All disturbed floodway areas, including the stream banks shall be restored to their original contours and seeded or otherwise stabilized upon completion of construction.

4.  The Director shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or permit not required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The Director shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal, state, and local permits have been obtained. 
B.  Preventing Increased Damages. 
1.  No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.

If requested, the Director of Public Works shall state which standard or principle will apply to the construction, maintenance, or operation of a facility in the future.  
9-2-14 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONTROL 
a)  Public Safety. The placement of any antenna, wireless facility or small wireless facilities located in the City right-of-way may not interfere with the frequencies used by public safety agencies for public safety communications. Unacceptable interference will be determined in accordance with industry standards and the Federal Communications Commission's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum. If an antenna, wireless facility or small wireless facility causes such interference, the owner must take all steps necessary to correct and eliminate the interference at its own costs. The City may terminate a permit for any antenna, wireless facility or small wireless facility based on such interference if the interference is not corrected. 
The City may reserve space on its utility pole for future public safety. This reservation of space may preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility where the City determines that the utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
b)  Minimum Requirements. The City's minimum requirements for traffic protection are contained in IDOT's Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and this Code. 
c)  Warning Signs, Protective Devices, and Flaggers. The wireless provider or utility is responsible for providing and installing warning signs, protective devices and flaggers, when necessary, meeting applicable federal, state, and local requirements for protection of the public and the facility's workers when performing any work on the rights-of-way. 
d)  Interference with Traffic. All work shall be phased so that there is minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
e)  Notice When Access is Blocked. At least 48 hours prior to beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any residence, business or institution, the wireless provider or utility shall notify the resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning time and duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving emergency repairs pursuant to Section 9-2-21 of this Chapter, the wireless provider or utility shall provide such notice as is practicable under the circumstances.

1)  No Interference with City Facilities. No utility facilities shall be placed in any location if the Director of Public Works determines that the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the City's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the City's utility facilities. 
2)  Minimum Interference and Impact. The proposed location shall cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-way. 
3)  No Interference with Travel. No utility facility shall be placed in any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way. 
4)  No Limitations on Visibility. No utility facility shall be placed in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way. 
5)  Size of Utility Facilities. The proposed installation shall use the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the particular application. 
6)  The City is not required to install or maintain any specific utility pole or to continue to install or maintain utility poles in any location if it makes a non-discriminatory decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type. For City utility poles with collocated small wireless facilities in place when the City makes a decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles, the City will, at its discretion, either maintain the utility pole or install and maintain an alternative utility pole for the collocation of the small wireless facility, or offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider. 
(Ord. No. 2018-32 , § II, 8-20-2018) 
b)  Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways. 
1)  Overhead Parallel Facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if: 
i)  Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole alignment will permit; 
ii)  Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of the curb, where available; 
iii)  Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone; 
iv)  No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and 
v)  Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line. 
2)  Underground Parallel Facilities. An underground parallel facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if: 
i)  The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the right-of-way line; 
ii)  A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit without disrupting the pavement); and 
iii)  In the case of an underground power or communications line, the facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as practicable. 
c)  Facilities Crossing Highways. 
1)  No Future Disruption. The construction and design of crossing facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of City highways may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities. 
2)  Cattle Passes, Culverts, or Drainage Facilities. Crossing facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.

i)  The design materials and construction methods will provide maximum maintenance-free service life; and 
ii)  Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is provided in the initial installation. 
6)  Markers. The City may require the utility to provide a marker at each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. §192.707 (1989). 
d)  Facilities to be Located Within Particular Rights-of-Way. The City may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not highways, rather than within particular highways. 
e)  Freestanding Facilities. 
1)  Small Wireless Facilities. 
i)  The City may not require the placement of a small wireless facility on a specific utility pole or category of poles. However, should the application necessitate the installation of a new utility pole, the City may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation. Should the applicant reject the proposed relocated collocation, it must provide a written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternative location will not satisfy the wireless provider's needs. The City may require any monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened from view in compliance with the appearance standards described below. 
ii)  If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new monopoles, utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the scale of the new freestanding facility. 
2)  Other Facilities. 
i)  The City may restrict the location and size of any monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way. No freestanding facility located within a right-of-way may be constructed or modified so that the height of the free standing facility is higher by more than ten feet or more than 10%, whichever is greater, than any other existing, freestanding facility located within the right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed facility, measured along the center line of the respective right-of-way. Where there are no other freestanding facilities located within 300 feet of the proposed facility, the maximum height of the freestanding facility shall be 45 feet. 
ii)  The City may require any monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened from view. 
iii)  If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new monopoles, utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the scale of the new freestanding facility. 
f)  Facilities Installed Above Ground. Above ground facilities may be installed only if: 
1)  No other existing facilities in the area are located underground; 
2)  New underground installation is not technically feasible; and 
3)  The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and cable. Existing utility poles and municipally-owned infrastructure shall be used wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles or monopoles is strongly discouraged. 
g)  Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures. 
1)  Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not permitted. 
2)  A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be based upon the following considerations: 
i)  The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in the event of damage to or failure of the facility; 
ii)  The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway structure in the transportation system; 
iii)  The alternative routings available to the utility and their comparative practicability; 
iv)  The proposed method of attachment; 
v)  The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the proposed facility; 
vi)  The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting; 
vii)  The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and 
viii)  The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared to the risk involved. 
h)  Appearance Standards. 
1)  The City may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality. 
2)  A utility facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed. 
i)  Height Restrictions for Small Wireless Facilities. Small wireless facilities are limited to a maximum height of ten feet above the utility pole or wireless structure on which it is collocated. The height limit of a new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure on which small wireless facilities are collocated is limited to the higher of: (i) ten feet higher than the tallest existing utility pole within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure that is in the same right-of-way; or (ii) 45 feet above ground level. The City shall designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structure shall control the height limitation. 
(Ord. No. 2018-32 , § II, 8-20-2018)

a)  Residential Design Standards. 
Purpose: Ensure visually acceptable facility design and to provide discretion on required and preferred design of small wireless facilities. 
Applicability: These design standards shall apply to each facility located in a district zoned for residential uses: 
1)  Applicants must use architectural treatments and stealth techniques to reduce potential visual impacts. 
2)  All new utility poles installed for the purpose of mounting a facility must be stealth or camouflaged to blend into the surrounding environment. Examples of stealth of camouflage designs are presented in Figure 1 below. 
3)  Small wireless facilities and all ancillary equipment associated with the facility must not emit sound. 
4)  Cables must be routed directly from the ground through the pole and equipment enclosures must completely enclose or hide cabling. No exposed cable is allowed. 
5)  No flashing lights or unnecessary, non-essential stickers are allowed to be placed on any facility. Stickers must be designed in the same color as the pole to which they are attached. 
6)  In no case shall equipment block the sidewalk or pedestrian pathway. All installations must maintain accessibility requirements and standards. 
7)  All newly installed equipment must be painted with graffiti-resistant paint to match pole color and surroundings. 
8)  Colors and materials shall be chosen to minimize the visibility of the facility. 
9)  Antennas attached to existing poles or municipally-owned infrastructure shall be painted and textured to match the existing structure. 
10)  Any ground-mounted facility shall be painted with non-reflective matte finish paint using color shades that are comparable or blend with surrounding natural elements such as soil, trees, or grasslands. Any ground-mounted facility shall be screened from the yard of the property in front of which it is located using year-round landscaping materials. The owner of the ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the landscaping materials for a period of one-year from planting. 
11)  All disturbed pavement and landscaping shall be replaced and areas of bare or disturbed soils must be re-vegetated. If replacement landscape is determined to be infeasible the City may accept mitigation funds to use elsewhere. The owner of the ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the restoration work or reseeding for a period of one-year. 
12)  No facility may display any signage or advertisements unless expressly allowed by the City in a written approval, recommended under FCC regulations or required by law or permit condition. Every facility shall at all times display signage that accurately identifies the facility owner and provides the facility owner's unique site number, and also provides a local or toll-free telephone number to contact the facility owner's operations center. All required or permitted signage must face toward the street or otherwise placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures. 
Figure 1. Sample Stealth Designs for Small Cell Utility Poles: 
 
 
b)  Design Standards in Special Aesthetic/Economic Purpose Zones. 
Purpose: to protect and promote the City's unique character in a manner consistent with State and federal laws and regulations. 
Applicability: These design standards shall apply to (a) each area, district, neighborhood or zone expressly designated in the City's Comprehensive Plan as having special aesthetic or economic impacts on the welfare of the community; and (b) each redevelopment area designed under the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act or the Business District Development and Redevelopment Act: 
1)  Siting of facilities in special aesthetic/economic purpose zones must respect the existing character or design ordinance of established zone. 
2)  Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment measures in their applications. 
3)  Effective camouflage so as to disguise the facility so that it appears to be something other than a facility and is at the same time compatible with its surroundings (for example, designed to look like a tree). 
4)  Facilities must be designed so that the facilities silhouette, mass and color are masked in such a way as to be virtually indistinguishable from their background. 
5)  Examples of stealth of camouflage designs are presented in Figure 1. 
c)  Design Standards in Historic Districts. 
Purpose: to promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the City by identifying, preserving, protecting, enhancing and encouraging the continued utilization and the rehabilitation of such areas, properties, structures, sites and objects having a special historical interest or value to the City and its citizens. 
Applicability: These design standards apply in any historic district or on any historic landmark: 
1)  Districts, sites, buildings, structures or objects, significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering or culture, that are listed, or are eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic Places are to be avoided, to the greatest extent possible. Local landmarked buildings, properties, sites, or historic districts that are so recognized by an ordinance that meets the requirements of the certified Local Government Program of the Illinois State historic Preservation Office are also to be avoided, to the greatest extent possible. 
2)  Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment measures in their applications. 
3)  Applicant must implement said City-approved design concepts, and the use of camouflage or stealth materials as necessary in order to achieve compliance with historic preservation review. 
4)  Prior to submitting an application, where the applicant submits an application to site facilities in a historic district, the applicant must meet with the City to discuss any potential design modifications appropriate for the installation. 
5)  When siting a facility in a historic district, wireless provider must avoid removing, obscuring or altering any historic material or significant architectural features. Rehabilitation and make-ready work must not destroy the distinguishing character of the property or its environment. 
6)  Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible by means such as rust removal, calking, limited paint removal and reapplication of paint. 
d)  General Design Standards. 
Applicability: These design standards apply to all facilities: 
1)  All facilities not governed by the preceding design standards must be placed so as to minimize visibility. The facility, including all ancillary equipment and appurtenances, must be a color that blends with the surroundings of the utility pole or municipally-owned infrastructure on which it is mounted and use non-reflective materials which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures. Any wiring must be concealed within the freestanding facility or covered with an appropriate cover. 
2)  The City may discourage the installation of facilities in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality. 
3)  A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners. 
4)  A facility may not be installed in a manner which defeats any existing concealment elements of the utility pole or municipally-owned infrastructure to which it is attached. 
5)  Facilities under common ownership or operated on the same radio frequency shall be separated as far as practicable.

(Ord. No. 2006-49, 6-19-2006)  
11-1-3 - ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION CHARGE AND SUBCLASSES THEREOF 
A.  Established; When Assessed; Determination: There is hereby established within the City of Park Ridge a charge for connecting into the waterworks or sewerage systems of the City. Such charge is to be assessed against new or additional users of the sewage collection system or the water system of the City and shall be known as the "Connection Charge." The charge shall be payable at the time a building or connection permit is issued. Contained within the "Connection Charge" are a number of sub-charges or sub-categories. In some instances, the charge established shall be a sum fixed within this Chapter. In other instances, such charge shall be based upon the cost to the City of the extension of a particular part of the system. In some instances, a sub-charge may be based upon the volume and strength of the proposed usage. If the building plans are not susceptible to an accurate estimate of the volume and strength of the usage, the person desiring to make the connection shall pay that portion of the fee based upon the most accurate estimate which can be made upon the plan submitted. At the time that the sewer and/or water connection is in full use, a reevaluation of the volume and strength of the usage shall be made and an adjustment of the fee shall be applied. Such reevaluation shall be made within one year of the date at which the operation, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, shall have reached its full use. 
The "Connection Charge" shall be determined by adding together the sub-charges which are applicable to the particular new or additional user of the system. There shall be four sub-charges, the sum of which shall constitute the total connection charge for entrance into the water and/or sewer system. The four sub-charges shall be known as: 
1.  The Water Connection Tap-on Fee; 
2.  The Water Meter Fee; 
3.  The Sewer Connection Tap-on Fee; and 
4.  The Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee. 
B.  Water Connection Tap-on Fee: The Water Connection Tap-on Fee shall be based upon the size of the water tap made into the water system. This fee is intended to reimburse the City for a portion of the water system previously created by the City into which a user now seeks to connect. The schedule of taps and charges shall be as provided in Section 20-7-3. 
C.  Water Meter Fee: The Water Meter Fee shall be based upon the size of the meter installed as required by Section 11-1-5 of this Chapter and shall be as prescribed in Section 20-7-4. This fee is intended to reimburse the City for the cost of the meter. 
D.  Sewer Connection Tap-on Fee: The Sewer Connection Tap-on Fee shall be as provided in Section 20-7-5. 
E.  Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee: The Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee is hereby established to reimburse the City for its costs in extending sewer and water lines to serve new and additional users and to increase its capacity to produce and transport water and to transport sewage. The City may provide, at its own initial expense, for the construction of expansions and extensions of its water supply system and for the increase in size of its sewage pumping plant and the extension and expansion of its sewer mains to certain areas within the City. In so doing, the City seeks to provide a material benefit to the property owners abutting such improvements and to encourage the development of such property. To reimburse the City for the funds so expended, the City has created a Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee. Such fee shall be based upon the pro rata share of the cost of said exploration, construction and extension, which cost was required to provide the sewer and water services being made available to the new or additional user. The Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee shall be based upon all such costs including but not limited to engineering fees, supervision, legal fees, land costs and construction. 
When a new or additional user of the system wishes to connect into the sewer and/or water system of the City, he shall request from the Director of Public Works an estimate of the sum of the Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee attributable to the property which he wishes to serve with municipal utilities. The Director of Public Works shall certify to such applicant the then current amount of the Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee attributable to the property sought to be served. In arriving at the Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee, the Director of Public Works may request such information from the applicant as shall be reasonably necessary in order that he may compute the amount of the fee. He shall, for example, be allowed to inquire as to the use which the applicant desires to make of the land. If an applicant should disagree with or dispute the amount of the Water and Sewer Expansion and Extension Connection Fee, in whole or in part, as determined by the Director of Public Works, he shall be allowed to appeal such decision to the Public Works Committee of the City Council. The Committee shall allow the applicant to appear before it, either at a regular or special meeting or otherwise, to present his objections to the estimate of costs. The Committee may require the Director of Public Works to appear before it to explain the manner in which such connection fee has been computed. The decision of the Committee regarding this matter shall be final.

The City shall have the right at any reasonable time to remove a meter temporarily for the purpose of testing its accuracy. Any meter which fails to register within 2% of the correct amount shall be repaired or replaced. 
C.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
History Ord. No. 2011-07, 1-17-2011. 
 
11-3-1 - AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE 
The purpose of this Chapter is to diminish threats to public health, safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties. The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity is the development and improvement of land and as such this Section regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts. 
This Chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to itself or others. 
To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control project, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development 
To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources.  
11-3-2 - DEFINITIONS

The information shall be submitted for both existing and proposed property conditions.  
11-3-5 - DRAINAGE PLAN 
The proposed drainage plan shall consist of the following: 
A.  Topographic Map: A topographic survey of the property at one-foot contours under existing and proposed conditions, and areas upstream and downstream, necessary to determine off-site impacts of the proposed drainage plan. The map shall utilize USGS elevations. 
B.  Drainage System: Mapping and descriptions of existing and proposed drainage system features of the property and immediate vicinity including: 
1.  watershed soils classifications; 
2.  location, size and slope of stormwater conduits and drainage swales; 
3.  sanitary or combined sewers; 
4.  depressional storage areas; 
5.  delineation of upstream and downstream drainage features and watersheds affected by the development;

3.  infiltrate runoff on-site; 
4.  provide stormwater detention structures; and 
5.  construct storm sewers.  
11-3-6 - DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS, AND METHODS  
11-3-6.1 - DESIGN FORMULA 
Unless some other method is approved by the City Engineer, runoff shall be determined by the Rational Method, as expressed by the design formula Q=CIA, in which: 
A = Total tributary drainage area in acres 
I = Average Rainfall Intensity, in inches per hour 
C = Coefficient of Runoff, and 
Q = Runoff, in cubic feet per second 
11-3-6.2: AREA: The area in acres used in the design formula shall be the water shed area tributary to the point in the system under consideration, and shall include any tributary area that may lie outside the development not provided with stormwater holding facilities. 
11-3-6.3 INTENSITY: The average rainfall intensity used in the design formula shall be based on rainfall frequencies set forth in Bulletin 70 "Frequency Distributions and Hydroclimatic Characteristics of Heavy Rainstorms in Illinois" prepared by the Illinois State Water Survey, 1989. 
11-3-6.4 RUNOFF COEFFICIENT: The runoff coefficient C is the ratio of runoff to rainfall and shall be as follows: 
a. all impervious areas (paved or hard surfaced areas of all types and buildings), C shall equal 0.95 (water surface C = 1.0);

3.  As to a limited liability company, if there has been a change in the managing partner or change in or replacement of any member of the limited liability company of whom fingerprinting had previously been required.

13-10-15 - IMPOUNDMENT FOR VIOLATIONS 
A.  The Police Chief is hereby authorized to direct and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization as provided in this Section. This program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon the public way by placement of a restraint in such a manner as to prevent its operation or if the eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation of any provision of this Article concerning obstruction of traffic, access or egress from driveways, alleys, fire lanes, hydrants or stations, or in any place where it constitutes an obstruction or a hazard, or where it impedes City workers during such operations as snow removal, the Police Chief may cause the eligible vehicle to be towed to a City vehicle pound or relocated to a legal parking place and there restrained. 
B.  A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization as provided herein any time after inclusion of its state registration number or previous or succeeding state registration number on an immobilization list. A vehicle's state registration number, and all other vehicles registered to the owner of said registered vehicle, shall be included on an immobilization list only if: 
1.  The registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated five or more final determinations of liability for parking, City license violation complaints, compliance citations, or automated traffic law violations in the City of Park Ridge, in any combination, on which no payment has been made or appearance filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County or before the Administrative Adjudication Division of the City of Park Ridge within the time specified by the complaints or citations; 
2.  At least 21 days prior to placing the registration plate number of the vehicle on the immobilization eligibility list, notice of impending vehicle immobilization has been sent to the registered owner via first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address of the registered owner recorded with the Secretary of State or in the case of a vehicle bearing a registration number of a state other than Illinois, at the address of the registered owner recorded in that state's registry of motor vehicles. 
C.  The notice required in subsection (B) shall state the name and address of the registered owner, the state registration number of the vehicle(s), the nature of the ordinances violated and the numbers and issue dates of the outstanding complaints. The notice shall also advise that a person may challenge the validity of the notice of impending vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and appearing in person within 21 days of the date of the notice and submitting evidence which would conclusively disprove liability, based on the following grounds: 
1.  That the person was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle on the date or dates the notices of violations were issued; or 
2.  That all of the fines or penalties for the violations cited in the notice were paid in full; or 
3.  That the registered owner has not accumulated five or more final determinations of liability for parking, City license violation complaints, or compliance citations, which were unpaid, at the time the notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued. 
D.  Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn that the vehicle is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its damage. 
The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of Sections 16-1 and 21-1 of the Illinois Criminal Code. The notice also shall provide information specifying how release of the immobilizing restraint may be had, and how the registered owner may obtain an immobilization hearing pursuant to this Section. 
E.  Except where the vehicle is otherwise subject to towing, if the immobilizing restraint has not been released pursuant to subsection (F) within 24 hours of its placement, the restraint may be released and the vehicle towed and impounded. 
F.  The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person shall be permitted to secure release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization and towing and storage fees, if applicable, specified in subsection I and all the fines and penalties on the outstanding complaints and citations specified in the notice of impending vehicle immobilization. 
G.  Within ten days after a vehicle has been impounded, notice of impoundment shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner of the vehicle at the address to which the notice specified in subsection B.2 was mailed. The notice shall state that the owner has the right to post-immobilization and post-towing hearing as provided in subsection H, and that if the car is not claimed within 30 days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with this Chapter. 
H.  The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing was erroneous or whether the vehicle was properly included on an immobilization list, if the owner files a written demand for a hearing with the Police Chief within 14 days after issuance of the notice specified in subsection G or within 14 days of the immobilization, whichever is later. A hearing shall be conducted within two business days of a written demand for hearing unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Failure to request or attend a scheduled hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing. In event of such failure, any amount deposited pursuant to subsection F.1 shall be forfeited. A hearing provided by this Section shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or notice of violation issued relative to the immobilized vehicle. 
I.  The fee for removal of the immobilization device shall be $100.00. The fee for towing subsequent to immobilization shall be $100.00. The storage fee shall be the fee usually charged to the City by the agency providing the storage service provided that no fees shall be assessed for any immobilization or tow which has been determined to be erroneous. 
J.  It shall be unlawful to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilizing device without the approval of the Police Chief. The unauthorized removal of an immobilized vehicle shall be subject to a penalty of no less than $500.00. 
K.  For purpose of this Section, the term "public way" includes any privately owned parking lot as to which the City has entered into a contractual agreement for traffic regulation pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/11-209. 
(Ord. No. 2005-51, 8-15-2005; Ord. No. 2009-30, 4-20-2009; Ord. No. 2012-24, 3-5-2012)  
13-10-16 - STORAGE AND PARKING OF TRAILERS ON PUBLIC STREETS 
A.  It shall be unlawful to store any trailer on any City street or other public way. 
B.  For purposes of this Section, "store" means to park for a period in excess of two days. Moving a trailer from one place to another on any public street or way shall not extend the number of days the trailer may be parked without violating this Section. 
C.  For purposes of this Section, "trailer" means any non-self-propelled, wheeled vehicle, designed for carrying persons or property when drawn by a motor vehicle. 
D.  No trailer shall be parked on any public street or way between sunset and sunrise unless it is marked with reflective materials so as to make it clearly visible to oncoming vehicles. 
E.  No trailer shall be parked on any public street or way unless it is properly licensed. 
F.  A complaint or notice of violation of this Section may be served by attaching or affixing it to the trailer or its cargo in any manner so as to be easily visible. 
G.  Each day a trailer is parked or stored in violation of this Section shall constitute a separate violation.  
13-10-17 - PARKING HOLIDAYS

No registration plate shall be covered by any tinted or colored screen. 
E.

Registration stickers issued as evidence of renewed annual registration shall be attached to registration plates as required by the secretary of state and shall be clearly visible at all times. 
It is illegal to park a vehicle, including a motor vehicle, motorcycle, trailer, semi-trailer or truck-tractor, on any public street, highway, roadway or in a public parking facility or lot if the registration plate or other registration materials fail to comply with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this Section.

Each vehicle parking within any parking meter zone shall park within the line or markings so established. It shall be unlawful to park any vehicle across or outside any such line or marking or to park said vehicle in such position that the same shall not be entirely within the area designated by such lines or markings. It shall be unlawful to park any vehicle across or outside any line or marking designating a parking space for parking spaces with or without a meter.

13-21-1 - DEFINITIONS 
For purposes of this article, the following definitions apply: 
A.  A "one-way or single trip movement" means one move from the point of origin to the point of destination. Stops between the point of origin and the point of destination are expressly prohibited. Single trip permits are effective for five consecutive days from the date of issuance unless otherwise directed by the Park Ridge Police Department. 
B.  "Round-trip movement" means a trip from point of origin to the point of destination and back to point of origin over the same route. Round-trip permits are effective for ten consecutive days from the date of issuance. 
C.  Limited continuous use movements of oversized and overweight vehicles are valid for a period of either 90 or 365 days, as set forth in the approved permit. A limited continuous permit may be issued for unlimited trips during the allowed time period. 
(Ord. No. 2015-67, 12-7-2015)  
13-21-2 - PERMITS 
A.  A permit issued by the Park Ridge Police Department shall be required for the movement of any vehicle, which is non-divisible or carrying a load which is non-divisible, on a roadway or bridge within the jurisdiction of the City which exceeds the following limits: 
1.  Maximum gross weight of more than 80,000 pounds; 
2.  Maximum gross length of 42 feet for single vehicles, 55 feet for tractor-semitrailer combinations, and more than 60 feet for all other combinations; 
3.  Maximum gross width of more than eight feet, six inches; 
4.  Maximum gross height of more than 13 feet, six inches; 
5.  Maximum axle weight of more than 20,000 pounds; 
6.  Maximum axle tandem weight of more than 34,000 pounds. 
This shall apply to any single vehicle or series of vehicles pulled by a single tractor. With respect to those roadways and bridges under construction, road closures with or without signage do not exempt overweight and/or over-sized movements from permit requirements when any traffic is allowed through construction zone(s) and when the movement is made by applicant(s) not performing construction on the roadway closed. In an emergency declared by resolution of the City Council, the requirements to obtain permits may be waived. 
Exempt from permits are the following: 
1.  Fire department vehicles; 
2.  Those vehicles operating under an emergency declaration; 
3.  City owned vehicles engaged in emergency utility repair; 
4.  Equipment used for snow and ice removal, owned or operated by any governmental body. 
B.  Permits shall be issued only in the name of a person, firm, business, or corporation that owns and operates the transporting vehicle or that operates the vehicle under a bona fide lease agreement. 
C.  Permits for vehicles that are both overweight and over-sized are valid only one half-hour before sunrise until one half-hour after sunset, on any day for which the permit would be considered valid by the Illinois Department of Transportation. 
D.  Permits are non-transferable and apply only to the permittee. 
E.  The City may issue revisions to permits: 
1.  To correct an error attributed to the City; 
2.  To correct an error attributed to the applicant, discovered before the move; 
3.  To adjust weights, dimension or routes as issued on the permit, before the move is made; 
4.  Any revisions made at the request of the permittee for purposes of changing weights, dimensions, routes or load description shall be made before any move is made at a cost of $100.00 per permit. 
F.  The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between the permittee and the City that the move described in the application will take place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the City's Police Department Traffic Section any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the City or the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms. Oversize and overweight permits may be processed by the Police Department electronically, through a contractual relationship with a service provider. 
G.  The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of the authority granted by the permit for the use of City roads, and any vehicle and/or load found to be off route will be considered off route and without a permit. Permits shall be in the driver's possession in either paper or electronic form at all times unless otherwise directed in writing by the Park Ridge Police Department and presented upon demand to any and all police officers for the purpose of inspection. 
H.  If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the proper utilities notified, property moved, bridges or highways analyses performed and completed in advance of any permit movement. 
I.  All movements under the permit shall be made in accordance with all applicable federal, State and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
J.  The Police Department shall maintain a list of reasonable provisions to accompany every permit. The Police Chief or designee may amend this document from time to time at his or her discretion. The provisions may not be more restrictive than those established by the Illinois Department of Transportation or the most current phase of interstate harmonization policies issued by the American Association of State and Highway Transportation Officials, except in extreme cases. Permit provisions must accompany every permit. 
K.  All single-trip or round-trip permits are limited to movements on assigned routes only. 
L.  All quarterly or annual permits are restricted to the following maximum limitations and routing: 
1.  The vehicle may not exceed 12 feet in width, 13 feet, six inches in height, and 115 feet in length. 
2.  The vehicle may not move across bridges or structures that are posted or listed as such on the City truck route map. 
3.  The vehicle may not move on a "no-truck" route that is posted or listed as such on the City truck route map, without prior written permission from the Police Department. 
4.  The vehicle may not use any City street as a cut-through to avoid using a state, county, or township highway. 
These permits are subject to all standards of application set forth in Section 13-21-4.B of this code, except that the load may be interchanged provided none of the above listed maximum weight and size dimensions are exceeded. Quarterly and annual permits must list the registration number and state for the power unit, and vehicle identification number (VIN). The serial number of the power unit, and/or owner applied number must also be listed, if applicable. 
M.  Permits are void if altered by the permittee. The permits issued under this section constitute the grant of a privilege by the City and may be denied or suspended for such reasons as the City may deem related to its governmental interests including, but not limited to: 
1.  A permittee's knowingly providing incorrect information in an application for a permit; 
2.  A permittee, its agents, or employees acting on a permit which has been altered for purposes of deception; 
3.  Non-compliance by permittee, its agents or employees with federal, State, or local ordinances pertaining to the transport of goods or operation of a vehicle engaged in the transport of goods;

Upon application for a permit(s) each applicant shall provide evidence of a valid comprehensive general liability insurance policy for protection against personal injury or property damage in the amount of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence. Such coverage shall be placed with a responsible company acceptable to the City, licensed to do business in the State of Illinois, and with a minimum insurance rating of A:VII as found in the current edition of A M Best's Key Rating Guide. Each policy shall bear an endorsement precluding the cancellation or reduction of said policies without providing the City of Park Ridge at least 30 days prior notice thereof in writing. All required insurance shall be maintained by the contractor in full force and effect during the life of the move.  
13-21-6 - SUSPENSION AND REINSTATEMENT

B.  The owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the Administrative Hearing Officer no later than ten business days after the notice was mailed to the owner of record. The date of the hearing must not be more than 15 days after a request for a hearing has been filed or at another agreed-upon date.

E.  If the owner of record requests a hearing, but fails to appear at the hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the Administrative Hearing Officer shall enter a default order in favor of the City in the amount of the administrative penalty prescribed for the violation, plus towing and storage fees. However, if the owner of record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner of record, no default order need be entered if the owner of record is informed of his or her right to a hearing and signs a written waiver.

The following words and terms wherever they occur in this Chapter shall be construed as herein defined: 
Flood Light: A luminare designed so that 90% of the emitted light is within an angle of 30 degrees to the center line of the light beam. 
Foot Candle: One foot candle is the amount of illumination provided by a light source of one international candle at a distance of one foot from the light source. 
Foot Lambert: One foot lambert is the brightness of a perfectly diffusing surface uniformity emitting or reflecting one lumen per square foot of surface. 
International Candle or Candle Power: One international candle is the unit of luminous intensity as established by standard light sources as maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Standards. This is called more commonly one candle power. 
Lumen: One lumen is that quantity of luminous energy included in one steradian unit solid angle from a uniform point source of one candle power. It is also defined as the luminous flux intercepted by a surface of one square foot, all points of which are one foot from a uniform point source of one candle power. 
Luminare: A device or fixture containing a light source and means for directing and controlling the distribution of light emitted therefrom.  
14-11-2 - REGULATIONS ON INTENSITY OF LIGHT 
Regulations on intensity of light permitted shall be as follows: 
A.  No lighting source shall cause more than 0.1 foot candle of illumination to fall on adjoining R1A, R1, R2 residentially zoned property. 
B.  No lighting source shall cause more than 0.2 foot candle of illumination to fall on adjoining R3 or R4 residential or O office zoned property. 
C.  No lighting source shall cause more than 2.0 foot candles of illumination to fall on any adjoining commercially zoned property. 
D.  No lighting source shall cause more than 5.0 foot candles of illumination to fall on any public way in commercial areas.  
14-11-3 - REGULATIONS ON GLARE 
Regulations on glare shall be as follows:

750 foot lamberts from R1A, R1 and R2 zoned property; 
1,500 foot lamberts from R3 and R4 zoned property; 
2,200 foot lamberts from any commercially zoned property; 
10,000 foot lamberts from any public way.  
14-11-4 - STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT 
Light intensity shall be measured in foot candles with a direct reading portable low range light meter having a range of zero to 20 foot candles; said meter shall be tested by an independent commercial photometric laboratory to obtain a certificate of calibration. Values set forth in this Chapter are maximum values measured at 90 degrees to the incidence of light from the source: Measurement methods and techniques shall be those recommended by the illuminating Engineering Society in their "Standard Methods for Measuring and Reporting Horizontal Foot Candle." 
Brightness measurement based on the foot lambert must be governed by the definition of the foot lambert and lumen. Because of the practical difficulties of measurement, calculated values for source brightness can be used with an accuracy comparable to measurements. Calculations should be in accordance with the following: 
A.  Spherical Bare Sources (Incandescent Lamps): The brightness shall be calculated as total lumens divided by 1/10 the square of the diameter of the source measured in inches. 
B.  Cylindrical Bare Sources (Fluorescent Lamps): The brightness shall be calculated as total lumens divided by 1/50 the product of length and diameter of the source in inches. 
C.  Floodlight Sources: The brightness of floodlight sources shall be calculated as the 1/8 of the total lumens divided by the area of the face of the floodlight in square feet. If the light source is mounted in a diffuse luminare, 7/10 of the above values shall be issued. 
The values of lumens to be used shall be based on the following efficiencies: 
Incandescent Filament Lamps 	Gaseous Discharge Lamps 
25 watt - 250 lumens 	40 watts - 1,200 lumens 
40 watt - 500 lumens 	100 watts - 3,000 lumens 
60 watt - 800 lumens 	250 watts - 11,000 lumens 
100 watt - 1,600 lumens 	400 watts - 5,000 lumens 
200 watt - 3,300 lumens 	1,000 watts - 65,000 lumens 
300 watt - 5,000 lumens 	
500 watt - 9,000 lumens 	
1,000 watt - 20,000 lumens

Any person who knowingly or negligently allows the operation of a motor vehicle under his or her control by an underage person, when the person knew or in the exercise of ordinary judgment should have known that the underage person was either impaired or had consumed any amount of alcohol within two hours prior to when this allowance to drive occurred.

G.  False Identification Not a Defense. It shall not be a defense to any action brought criminally, civilly or administratively against any liquor licensee or any other person charged with the delivery of any alcoholic liquor to an underage person that such a person produced false identification or false proof of age. The person or persons hearing and deciding the charges may consider such a claim when determining the penalty to be assessed or the apportionment of damages. 
H.  Operation of a Motor Vehicle While in a State of Impairment. It shall be unlawful for any underage person to operate a motor vehicle on a street or highway of the City while in a state of impairment due to the consumption of an alcoholic liquor or with any alcohol at all in his or her system. For purposes of this section only, "operation of a motor vehicle" shall have the definition ascribed to it in the Illinois Vehicle Code rather than the definition set forth in Section 12-6-27 of this Code. 
I.  Operation of a Motor Vehicle by Underage Persons with an Alcoholic Liquor in or on the Vehicle; When the Underage Person is Impaired Due to Alcohol or has Alcohol in the System or is Operating the Vehicle in Violation of a Restriction Pursuant to this Chapter. The following shall apply when any underage person is found in the City operating any motor vehicle in which or on which is found any alcoholic liquor, or when the underage person is in a state of impairment due to consumption of alcohol or to have alcohol in his or her system or is found operating a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction pursuant to this Chapter: 
1.  The motor vehicle shall be subject to immediate impoundment by the police department. 
2.  The following factors shall not be considerations in determining whether or not to impound the motor vehicle: 
a.  Whether the alcoholic liquor is in an opened or an unopened container. 
b.  Whether the operator is the owner of the alcoholic liquor in the vehicle. 
c.  Whether the operator had knowledge of the existence of the alcoholic liquor within the motor vehicle. 
3.  Upon impoundment, the motor vehicle may be released only to another person showing proof of ownership or lease rights to the motor vehicle. 
a.  If the underage operator is the owner or lessor of the vehicle, then the vehicle may be released only to a parent or spouse of the underage owner. If the underage person has no parent or spouse living in the immediate area, the vehicle may be released, upon satisfactory proof of such fact, as set forth in subsection 4 of this Section. 
4.  The motor vehicle may not be released to any person who was a passenger in the motor vehicle at the time the alcoholic liquor or impairment was found unless at least 24 hours have passed from the time of the finding. 
5.  The vehicle shall not be released until the person seeking the release has paid an administrative fee of $200.00 to the City, plus any towing or storage costs. 
6.  If the operator is subsequently found guilty of driving with open alcohol in a motor vehicle or possession of alcohol by a minor or of operating a motor vehicle while impaired pursuant to Subsection G of this Section, that person shall not be permitted for a period of six months, to operate a motor vehicle on any public way within the limits of the City unless accompanied by a licensed driver over 30 years of age. 
7.  The above obligations and penalties shall be in addition to the penalties that may be assessed in a court of law for any charges incident to the stop. 
8.  Any law enforcement officer, the police department and the City and any of its officers or agents shall be absolutely immune from any liability or exposure to liability of any kind or nature for the enforcement or implementation of this Section. 
J.  Procedure for Driving Restriction Notification; Hearing. 
1.  If a person has committed a violation that subjects the person to a restriction on driving in Park Ridge, such a restriction shall not take place until the police department has sent, by regular mail, a notice of the pending driving restriction. The notice shall be mailed at least two weeks before the restriction is to go into effect and shall contain: 1) a statement that the restriction applies only to the City; 2) the date the restriction is to go into effect and the date on which it ends; 3) a map showing the City limits; 4) a notice that the operator has the right to request a hearing within ten days of notification to determine the validity of the restriction. The validity of the restriction may be challenged only on the grounds that the person was not the actual person found guilty or that there was no finding of guilty for the underlying offense. 
2.  The hearing shall be conducted by a supervisory member of the City police department, appointed by the Chief of Police and whose determination shall be final. 
K.  Penalty for Violating Driving Restriction. 
1.  Restriction: No person shall operate and no person, including a parent, shall permit another to operate a motor vehicle within the corporate limits of the City in violation of the restrictions set forth in this Chapter. 
2.  Penalty: Any person found guilty of violating this Subsection (K) shall be fined in the mandatory amount of $500.00. 
L.  Zero Tolerance With Respect to Alcohol Use. It shall be unlawful for any underage person to have any alcohol of any level detectable by observation or blood/alcohol testing in the person's system. If the blood/alcohol level is less than .05 milliliters of alcohol per liter of blood, then it shall be a defense that the alcohol was acquired pursuant to the exceptions set forth in subsection (C) of this Section. Such defense may be established by clear and convincing evidence and by the testimony of the adult providing the alcoholic liquor. 
M.  Possession of Alcohol By Underage Persons. It shall be unlawful for any person under the age of 21 to possess, dispense, or consume alcoholic liquor. Any person to whom the sale, gift or delivery of any alcoholic liquor is prohibited because of age shall not purchase, accept a gift of such alcoholic liquor or have such alcoholic liquor in his possession.  
14-21-2 - REFERRAL TO PEER JURY 
Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the referral of underage persons to the peer jury for disposition consistent with the rules and regulations of the peer jury.  
14-21-3 - VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES 
Fines assessed by the court against any offender may be in addition to any penalty assessed against a licensee in any administrative proceeding. 
A.  General. Unless another penalty is set forth in this Chapter, every person found guilty of a violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be subject to a fine of $1,000.00 for the first offense and $1,500.00 for each subsequent offense. A separate offense shall be deemed to have been committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. Any fines set forth in this chapter shall be assessed regardless of whether the violator is convicted or placed on supervision by the court. 
B.  Substance Abuse. If the offense is related to alcohol or substance abuse and the offender is under 21 years of age, the court or administrative adjudication hearing officer may assign the offender to a drug and alcohol education and abuse counseling program that is licensed by the Illinois Department of Alcohol and Substance Abuse and requires a certified evaluation program and not less than four hours of counseling. If the violator agrees to attend such a program, the violator shall pay for the cost of the program and a fine of $100.00 for a first offense. For a second offense, the offender shall attend a drug and alcohol education and counseling program of at least ten hours in duration as determined by the licensed program and shall pay for the cost of the program and a fine of not less than $250.00. If the offense is related to alcohol or substance abuse and the offender is under 21 years of age and is either found guilty or pleads no contest and agrees to pay the applicable fine, the City will report the person to the Secretary of State's Office and his/her driver's license will be suspended in accordance with state law.

(Ord. No. 2017-37 , § 2, 7-17-2017)  
14-22-6 - PROCEDURE 
When the Chief of Police of the City receives one or more police reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on or within a property, the Chief of Police shall independently review such reports to determine whether they describe criminal acts. Upon such findings, the Chief of Police may: 
A.  Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information: 
1.  The street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the property. 
2.  A statement that the Chief of Police has information that the property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the nuisance activities that may exist, or that have occurred. The Chief of Police shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action that the Chief of Police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation. 
3.  Demand that the person in charge respond to the Chief of Police within ten days to discuss the nuisance activities. 
B.  After complying with the notification procedures described herein when the Chief of Police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a second nuisance activity at or with a property and determines that the property has become a chronic nuisance property, the Chief of Police shall: 
1.  Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has been determined to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information: 
a.  The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property. 
b.  A statement that the Chief of Police has determined the property to be a chronic nuisance property with a concise description of the nuisance activities leading to his/her findings. 
c.  Demand that the person in charge respond within ten days to the Chief of Police and propose a course of action that the Chief of Police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation. 
d.  Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of the determination by the Chief of Police. 
e.  A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such address as shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is located, and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these persons are different than the person in charge, and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid. 
f.  A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after ten days have elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the Chief of Police. 
g.  The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this Chapter. 
C.  If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by the City pursuant to this Chapter, a person in charge stipulates with the Chief of Police that the person in charge will pursue a course of action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation, the Chief of Police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a period of not less than ten days nor more than 30 days, except in the case of a nuisance activity where a search warrant was executed at the property. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within 30 days, the Chief of Police shall request authorization from the City to commence a legal proceeding to abate the nuisance. 
D.  Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the Chief of Police shall send copies of the notice, as well as, any other documentation which supports legal proceedings to the City Attorney. 
E.  When a person in charge makes a response to the Chief of Police as required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with the furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered for any other purpose. 
(Ord. No. 2017-37 , § 2, 7-17-2017)  
14-22-7 - COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION; BURDEN OF PROOF 
In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the City shall have the initial burden of showing by preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
A.  It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a chronic nuisance property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become a chronic nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
B.  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court or the City hearing officer, may consider any of the following factors if the need be found appropriate, and shall refer to those found applicable: 
1.  The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge to mitigate or correct the problem at the property. 
2.  Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous. 
3.  The magnitude or gravity of the problem. 
4.  The cooperation of the person in charge with the City. 
5.  The cost of the City investigating and correcting or attempting to correct the condition. 
(Ord. No. 2017-37 , § 2, 7-17-2017)  
14-22-8 - EMERGENCY CLOSING PROCEDURES 
A.  In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate threat to the public safety and welfare, the City may apply to the court for such interim relief, as is deemed by the Chief of Police to be appropriate. In such an event, the notification provision set forth in Section 14-22-5 of this Chapter need not be complied with, however, the City shall make a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing. 
B.  In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic nuisance property" as defined in this Chapter, the court may order the remedy set out. In addition, in the event that it also finds the person in charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or violating this Chapter and permitted the activities to occur, the court may assess a civil fine as provided above. 
C.  The court may authorize the City to physically secure the property within the time specified by the court. In the event that the City is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the City to effect a closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property. As used herein, "costs" means those costs actually incurred by the City for the physical securing of the property, as well as tenant relocation costs. 
D.  The City Code Enforcement Department effecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs and the City shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property. 
E.  Any person who is assessed the costs of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the City. 
F.  A tenant is entitled to their reasonable relocation costs, as those are determined by the court if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into the property, after either: 
1.  The owner or tenant received notice as described herein of the Chief of Police's determination as described above. 
2.  Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought pursuant to this Section.

A.  Determination prior to violation notice. Before a Violation Notice may be issued for any Automated Traffic Law Violation, a determination must be made by a technician employed or contracted by the City that based upon inspection of Recorded Images generated by the System, the motor vehicle was being operated so as to commit an Automated Traffic Law Violation. If the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a Violation Notice shall not be issued. A Recorded Image of a violation obtained by the automated traffic law enforcement system and that has been inspected by a technician shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this Code. 
B.  Violation notice. 
1.  A Violation Notice shall be served by mail to the address of the registered owner of a vehicle cited for an Automated Traffic Law Violation as recorded with the Secretary within 30 days after the Secretary notifies the City of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation. The original or a facsimile of a Violation Notice or, in the case of a Violation Notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on the Violation Notice, shall be retained by the Administrator, and a record kept in the ordinary course of business. A Violation Notice issued and served in accordance with this Chapter, a copy of the Violation Notice or the computer generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the Violation Notice. The Violation Notice, copy or computer generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings. 
2.  The City shall only be required to notify a lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee's name by an affidavit and a copy of the lease within 60 days of the Notice's issuance. If the driver information is not provided within 60 days, the leasing company/lessor may be found liable. 
3.  The Notice of Violation shall include the following information:

g.  The amount of the civil penalty and the date by which the penalty should be paid (21 days from the date of issuance), if a hearing is not requested, and a statement that the payment of the fine shall operate as a final disposition of the violation; 
h.  a statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by the date noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or lessee; 
i.  The amount of the late fee; 
j.  A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified or to contest liability in a timely manner will result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle; 
k.  A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie evidence of a violation of a red light signal; 
l.  A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the fine or challenging the charge in court, by mail or by administrative hearing; 
m.  A statement explaining how an administrative hearing may be requested; and 
n.  The identification number of the person issuing the Notice. 
C.  Service of notices. All notices shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary, and, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database or, if to the lessee of the cited vehicle, at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of the lease, and, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office database. Service of such Notices shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. 
D.  Administrative hearings. The owner of a vehicle cited in a Violation Notice may request a hearing by the respond-by date on the Notice of Violation (21 days from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or set forth an applicable defense. The lessee of a vehicle cited in a Violation Notice likewise shall be afforded the opportunity for a hearing pursuant to Section 20-6-7 of this Code. 
E.  Defenses. The following may be considered defenses by the Hearing Officer for an Automated Traffic Law Violation: 
1.  That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred, and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation; 
2.  That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle; or (ii) as part of a funeral procession. 
3.  The driver received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation for the same incident 
To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. 
F.  Findings, decision and order. The hearing officer shall enter a Findings, Decision and Order at the conclusion of a hearing. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's Notice of Findings, Decision and Order shall become final: (a) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or (b) upon expiration of the period for filing such a petition without a filing having been made.

A Findings, Decision and Order is final for purposes of judicial review when the Respondent appears for the hearing. 
G.  Notice of determination of liability. If the registered owner fails to pay or contest the Notice of Violation within 21 days, a Notice of Determination of Liability will be sent to the owner indicating that a fine in the amount of $100.00 is due to the City. The notice will also state that the owner can petition the City to set aside the determination of liability within 14 days. The owner will also be notified that the failure to pay the $100.00 fine within 14 days will result in a late fee of $100.00 added to the original fine. If the owner does not pay the $100.00 as specified in the notice or petition the City to set aside the determination within 14 days, a Notice of Final Determination of Liability, as described in Sections 20-6-9(I) and 20-6-11(I), will be mailed to the owner indicating, in addition, that the owner has exhausted all challenge options and the $100.00 fine and $100.00 late fee is a debt due and owing to the City and must be paid within 14 days. 
H.  Appealing determination of liability. A person owing an unpaid fine or penalty for an Automated Traffic Law Violation penalty may file a petition to set aside a determination of liability within 14 days after service by the City of a Notice of Determination of Liability. Such a petition shall be filed by sending the same, together with any documentation in support thereof, to the Administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery to the Administrator. The grounds for such a petition shall be limited to: (1) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the Violation Notice was issued, (2) the person having already paid the fine or penalty for the Violation in question, (3) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing.

1.  A statement that the unpaid fine and any penalty assessed is a debt due and owing the City.

3.  A warning that a failure to pay the fine and penalty may result in the suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to pay fines or penalties for five or more Violations.

A Suspension Notice, as provided by Section 11-208.6 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-208.6, and Section 13-20-3 of the Park Ridge Municipal Code, shall be sent to the person liable for any fine or penalty that remains due and owing on five or more unpaid Automated Traffic Law Violations. The Suspension Notice shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database. Service of a Suspension Notice shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. 
K.  Challenging certified reports. 
1.  If the Administrator provides a Suspension Notice to a vehicle owner and subsequently makes a Certified Report to the Secretary, the subject vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of the Certified Report in writing. To do so, the vehicle owner must submit to the Administrator a written statement under oath, together with any supporting documentation, establishing one of the following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the Certified Report: (1) that the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject vehicle or vehicles receiving five or more Automated Traffic Law Violations on the date or dates such Violation Notices were issued, or (2) that the person already paid the fines or penalties for the five or more Automated Traffic Law Violations indicated on the Certified Report. Such statement and supporting documentation must be sent to the Administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand-delivered to the Administrator within five days after the person receives notice from the Secretary that the person's driver's license will be suspended at the end of a specified period of time unless the Secretary is presented with a notice from the City certifying that the fines or penalties due and owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's name on the Certified Report was in error. 
2.  The Administrator shall notify the Secretary of State whenever a person named in the Certified Report has paid the previously recorded fine or penalty or whenever the City determines that the original report was in error. A certified copy of such notification shall also be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein. 
L.  Non-appearance procedures. Those who receive Violation Notices may contest the merits of the alleged Automated Traffic Law Violation without attending a hearing by sending a notarized statement, together with any supporting documentation, to the Administrator via certified mail, return receipt requested, within 21 days after service of the Violation Notice. Such a statement shall set forth the reasons why a finding of liability should not be entered. The hearing officer shall make an adjudication based upon the facts set forth in the notarized statement of facts and the facts contained in the Violation Notice. 
M.  Penalties. The owner (or lessee) of a motor vehicle is subject to a penalty of $100.00 per Automated Traffic Law Violation. In the event that such penalty is not paid within 14 days after service of a Notice of Determination of Liability or a Findings, Decision and Order, an additional $100.00 late payment penalty shall be imposed. A penalty shall not apply if the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation.

In order to ensure that Code violations are remedied in a timely manner, an Administrative Hearing Officer, upon issuing a determination of liability that includes an order of compliance, may order the respondent in the case to obtain a bond to ensure respondent's timely compliance with the Code provision(s) found to have been violated. Any bond ordered pursuant to this Subsection 20-6-15.B.1 shall name the City as beneficiary and shall be in the amount specified by the Administrative Hearing Officer, provided that the amount of the bond shall be reasonably related to the cost of compliance.

B.  After the expiration of the period for which judicial review may be sought, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the determination of liability of an Administrative Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, except for automated traffic law violations. At such time, the Administrative Hearings Supervisor shall send a notice of final determination of liability to respondent. 
C.  Any fine, penalty, and/or cost remaining unpaid after the notice of final determination of liability is sent shall constitute a debt due and owing the City.

(d)  Fees. Every application shall be accompanied by the required filing fee as established and modified, from time to time, by the City Council in Article 20, Chapter 2 of the City's Municipal Code. The failure to pay such fee when due shall be grounds for refusing to process the application, and for denying or revoking any permit or approval for the subject property. No fees shall be waived, and no fees shall be refunded, except those authorized by the City Council at its sole discretion. 
A current fee schedule, as of the date of adoption of this Ordinance, is included in Appendix C (Fee Schedule) for reference only. Applicable fees shall be as set forth in Article 20, Chapter 2 of the City's Municipal Code. 
(e)  Withdrawal of application. An applicant shall have the right to withdraw an application at any time prior to the decision on the application by a City official, commission or board, including the ability to withdraw the application if it has been tabled by a commission or board. There shall be no refund of fees. Requests for withdrawal shall be in writing by the applicant. 
(f)  Successive applications. Within one (1) year of the date of denial, a subsequent application shall not be reviewed or heard unless there is substantial new evidence available, or if a significant mistake of law or of fact affected the prior denial. Such subsequent application then shall include a detailed statement of the grounds justifying its consideration. The Zoning Administrator shall make a determination as to whether the subsequent application is appropriate. If the Zoning Administrator finds that there are no grounds for consideration of the subsequent application, he/she shall summarily, and without hearing, deny the request. 
3.3 - Notice. 
(a)  Published Notices. For all applications that require a public hearing, the City shall cause a notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. The notice shall include the date, time, place and purpose of such hearing, the name of the applicant, and the address of the subject property. Such notice shall be published no less than fifteen (15) days, nor more than thirty (30) days, in advance of the scheduled hearing date.

The applicant shall provide the stamped and addressed notices to the Zoning Administrator who shall deposit them in a U.S. postal facility for delivering. If a noticed property owner objects to the administrative variance, such variance shall then be considered a minor variance and subject to the minor variance notice requirements. 
(4)  Giving notice pursuant to this section shall not be construed to prevent the applicant from giving such additional notice as he/she may deem appropriate. 
(5)  The body conducting the hearing shall hear no application unless the applicant complies in all respects all notice requirements. 
(c)  Posted Sign Notices. The City shall post a sign on the subject property for all public hearings for major and minor zoning variances, special uses, planned developments, zoning map amendments, and public meetings for site plan reviews, and Zoning Administrator decisions on administrative variance in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Location and Time Period for Posting Signs. The required posting period shall be no less than fifteen (15) consecutive days, but no more than thirty (30) days, prior to the public hearing, site plan review public meeting, or scheduled date of decision for administrative variances (excluding the day of the hearing, meeting or decision from this period).

(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008) 
3.4 - Public hearing. 
(a)  Conduct of Public Hearings. 
(1)  A "public hearing" is a formal proceeding mandated by law for the purpose of taking evidence to formulate a decision or recommendation on an issue within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Board of Appeals and Planning and Zoning Commission. The primary purpose of a public hearing is to allow interested parties an opportunity to listen, comment on and ask questions regarding evidence presented at any legislatively mandated proceeding. 
(2)  Meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals or Planning and Zoning Commission, including public hearings, shall be subject to the Illinois Open Meetings Act. 
(3)  Any party to a public hearing may arrange for the proceedings to be recorded and transcribed by a certified shorthand reporter at that party's expense. The City may request a transcript at the applicant's expense. A copy of any transcript prepared shall be filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Planning and Zoning Commission and kept in the case file. The Zoning Board of Appeals and Planning and Zoning Commission, at its discretion, may direct that the proceedings be recorded at the expense of the person initiating the action (the "Petitioner"), which is the subject of the public hearing and may require the petitioner to deposit funds sufficient to cover the cost of such recording and transcribing. 
(4)  The Chair, with the consent of two thirds (?) majority of the body present, may limit individual testimony to a specific time to provide a reasonable opportunity for all interested persons to testify. 
(5)  At a public hearing, a petitioner may appear on his or her own behalf or may be represented by an attorney or other agent qualified by law to represent the petitioner. 
(6)  In addition to the petitioner, any person having an interest in the action which is the subject of the public hearing ("Interested Party") may appear at the public hearing and give testimony. If an attorney is representing an Interested Party, the attorney shall file an appearance with the Board or Commission and serve a notice of appearance on the petitioner not less than three (3) business days prior to the public hearing. Failure to give such notice of appearance may be grounds for continuing the public hearing to a later date. 
(7)  An Interested Party wishing to testify at the public hearing shall state for the record his or her name and address. 
(8)  An Interested Party wishing to ask questions of a witness may, at the time indicated by the Chair, direct questions to the witness from the podium. An Interested Party shall give his or her name and address before questioning a witness. This opportunity for questioning a witness shall not be used by the questioner to offer testimony or evidence from the podium. 
(9)  All persons offering testimony at a public hearing shall testify under oath. An attorney shall be sworn if he or she offers testimony but not if he or she is questioning witness, summarizing witness testimony, or addressing the Commission on procedural issues. Testimony may be given only from the witness stand. 
(10)  Minutes, a transcript or summary notes will be distributed with the agenda for the next regular meeting, or as soon as such may be reasonably available. 
(b)  Continuances. The Chairperson, with approval of the body conducting the hearing, may change or continue the regular public hearing date and time. In order to reopen the hearing, no new notice shall be required if a hearing is continued to a specific date, provided that a public announcement of the future date, time and place of the continued hearing is made at the hearing, and placed in the minutes. If the hearing is adjourned, rather than continued to a specific date, in order to reopen the hearing, all notices must be given that would have been required for the initial public hearing. 
Section 4 - APPLICATIONS AND APPROVAL PROCESSES 

4.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Section is to delineate the scope of applicability, specific procedures and requirements, and approval criteria that are applicable to each zoning application and approval. 
4.2 - Zoning interpretation. 
(a)  Purpose. This interpretation authority is not intended to add or change the essential content of the Ordinance. The interpretation authority is intended to recognize that the provisions of this Ordinance, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific zoning issue. Such issues may often be addressed by reference to general circumstances that the specific provision was intended to address. 
(b)  Initiation. Applications for zoning interpretations may be filed by an owner of any property in the City. In addition, the City Council or the Planning and Zoning Commission may request that the Zoning Administrator render an interpretation. Requests initiated by the City require an application, but are exempt from fees. The interpretation must be for the purpose of furthering some actual development. 
(c)  Authority and Execution. The Zoning Administrator shall review and make final decisions on requests for interpretations. Nothing in this Section shall require the Zoning Administrator to make an interpretation if he is of the opinion that the exposure to liability for the City on account of the interpretation outweighs the benefit to the requestor. 
(d)  Procedure. All applications for interpretations shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, in accordance with the requirements in Section 3.2 (Application). Upon receiving a complete application, the Zoning Administrator shall review a request for an interpretation and render the interpretation within a reasonable time. The Zoning Administrator shall have the ability to request additional information prior to rendering an interpretation. 
(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008) 
4.3 - Appeal of a zoning administrator determination. 
(a)  Purpose. The zoning appeals process for review of decisions of the Zoning Administrator is intended to provide appropriate checks and balances on administrative authority. 
(b)  Initiation. Applications for appeals may be filed by any owner of any property in the City that is directly affected by a decision made under this Ordinance by the Zoning Administrator. 
(c)  Authority and execution. The Zoning Board of Appeals may review only those determinations of the Zoning Administrator which result from requests made pursuant to this Ordinance. Other decisions and actions of the Zoning Administrator cannot be appealed under this process. 
(d)  Procedure. All applications for appeals shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, in accordance with the requirements in Section 3.2 (Application). Upon receiving a complete application, the Zoning Administrator shall forward a copy of the application to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing, in accordance with Sections 3.4 (Public Hearing), within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application. If, in the Zoning Board of Appeal's judgment, the application does not contain sufficient information to enable the Board to properly discharge its responsibilities, the Board may request additional information from the applicant. In that event, the sixty (60) day period shall be suspended pending receipt of all requested information. Notice shall be given in accordance with Sections 3.3 (Notice). The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide the appeal within forty-five (45) days of the close of the public hearing. The Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination. (See Appendix B for Flowchart 1: Appeals Process) 
(e)  Limitations on Appeals. A decision may only be appealed if an application is filed within thirty (30) days of that decision. 
(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008) 
4.4 - Zoning variance. 
(a)  Purpose. The variance process is to provide a narrowly circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications of this Ordinance that create particular hardships. 
(b)  Initiation. Applications for zoning variances may be filed by an owner of any property in the City for that property. 
(c)  Authority and Execution. Variances may be authorized by the terms of this Ordinance. Minor and major variances, in accordance with the standards of, and as defined by, Paragraph D.2 (Minor Variance) and D.3 (Major Variance), may be authorized only after a public hearing, where the Zoning Board of Appeals has made findings of fact in accordance with Paragraph E (Findings of Fact) below, that owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will result in practical difficulties or particular hardship for the owner of land or a structure. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to grant certain administrative variances, in accordance with the standards of, and as defined by, Paragraph D.1 (Administrative Variance) and only after making findings of fact in accordance with Paragraph E (Findings of Fact) below. 
(d)  Procedure. All applications shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the requirements in Section 3.2 (Application). Upon receiving a complete application, the Zoning Administrator shall make a determination whether the application is for an administrative variance, a minor variance or a major variance. In the case of a minor or major variance, the Zoning Administrator shall forward a copy of the application to the Zoning Board of Appeals. (See Appendix B for Flowchart 2: Variance Process.) (Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008) 
(1)  Procedure for Administrative Variance. 
a.  The Zoning Administrator is authorized to render final decisions on application for variances from the regulations of this Ordinance in the following instances and in no others: 
i.  A variance of the applicable minimum lot size requirements for single-family and two-family dwellings may be granted by the Zoning Administrator if the substandard lot has an existing structure constructed upon it at the time of adoption of this Ordinance. If the lot is vacant, the Zoning Administrator is not authorized to grant any part of the request. In some instances, a lot width or lot area that does not meet Ordinance requirements may be controlled by the provisions of Section 15.5 (Nonconforming Lots of Record). 
ii.  A variance to applicable off-street parking and loading requirements by no more than five percent (5%). 
iii.  A variance to the regulations contained in Section 12 (Off-Street Parking and Loading) relating to the storage of recreational vehicles in required front and corner side yards in cases where physical access to an interior side or rear yard is impractical. 
b.  The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and make findings of fact in accordance with Paragraph E (Findings of Fact) below, and shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the request. The Zoning Administrator shall render a decision within thirty (30) days of the date indicated on the required notice. If, in the Zoning Administrator's judgment, the application does not contain sufficient information to enable him to properly discharge his responsibilities, he may request additional information from the applicant. In that event, the thirty (30) day period shall be suspended pending receipt of all requested information. The Zoning Administrator may also, at his discretion, determine that, because of its nature, a variance application shall be resubmitted in accordance with the procedures for a minor or major variance, as described in Paragraphs D-2 (Minor Variance) or D-3 (Major Variance) below. 
c.  If any noticed property owner objects to the administrative variance application in writing, prior to the date the Zoning Administrator is scheduled to render a decision, the application shall be resubmitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals as a minor variance. Minor variance application, notice and public hearing requirements shall be required. 
d.  If the Zoning Administrator denies the application for an administrative variance, the applicant shall have the right to appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Appeals must be filed within thirty (30) days of the Zoning Administrator's denial in accordance with Section 4.3 (Zoning Appeal). 
(2)  Procedure for Minor Variance. 
a.  The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to render final decisions on applications for variances from the regulations of this Ordinance in the following instances and in no others: 
i.  A variance of the applicable minimum lot size requirements for single-family and two-family dwellings may be granted for a vacant lot provided that the minimum lot area shall not be reduced more than ten percent (10%), nor shall the minimum lot width requirements be reduced more than twenty-five percent (25%). If the requested variance exceeds this limitation (either lot area or lot width), the Zoning Administrator is not authorized to grant any part of the request. No variance may create a substandard lot out of an existing conforming lot. In some instances, a minimum lot width or lot area that does not meet Ordinance requirements may be controlled by the provisions of Section 15.5 (Nonconforming Lots of Record). 
ii.  A variance of the applicable bulk regulations, including minimum yard areas and maximum height and lot coverage requirements by no more than twenty percent (20%), and a variance of the floor area ratio for existing buildings by no more than ten percent (10%) of total floor area. No variance may be considered for floor area ratio of new construction. 
iii.  A variance to applicable off-street parking and loading requirements by no more than twenty-five percent (25%). 
iv.  A variance of the regulations pertaining to restoration of damaged or destroyed nonconforming structures contained in Section 15 (Nonconformities). 
v.  A variance to the maximum height of fences by no more than twenty percent (20%). 
b.  The Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with Section 3.4 (Public Hearing) within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application. Notice for the public hearing shall be in accordance with Section 3.3 (Public Notice). The Zoning Board of Appeals shall make findings of fact, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, with respect to each of the applicable standards in Paragraph E (Findings of Fact) below. If, in the Zoning Board of Appeal's judgment, the application does not contain sufficient information to enable the Board to properly discharge its responsibilities, the Board may request additional information from the applicant. In that event, the sixty (60) day period shall be suspended pending receipt of all requested information. Following the close of the public hearing and findings of fact, the Board shall grant or deny the minor variance within forty-five (45) days. 
c.  The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the location, construction, design and use of the property benefited by a variance as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest, adjacent property and property values. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may be imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variance. The terms of relief granted, including any conditions or restrictions, shall be specifically set forth in the concluding statement separate from the findings of fact. 
(3)  Procedure for Major Variance. 
a.  Major variances, defined as any variance other than those described in Paragraphs (d)(1) (Administrative Variance) and (d)(2) (Minor Variance) above, shall be reviewed by the Zoning Board of Appeals in a public hearing, but the Board shall have no authority to grant final approval for or denial of such major variances. 
b.  The Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with Section 3.4 (Public Hearing) within sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall recommend findings of fact to the City Council, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, with respect to each of the standards in Paragraph E (Findings of Fact) below. If, in the Zoning Board of Appeal's judgment, the application does not contain sufficient information to enable the Board to properly discharge its responsibilities, the Board may request additional information from the applicant. In that event, the sixty (60) day period shall be suspended pending receipt of all requested information. 
c.  The Zoning Board of Appeals shall vote to recommend approval or approval with conditions, or to recommend denial of the application. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall, within forty-five (45) days of the close of the public hearing, forward its recommendation to the City Council. 
d.  The City Council shall consider the major variance within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Zoning Board of Appeals recommendation. The City Council shall have the authority to approve the major variance by enactment of an ordinance, with or without conditions, or to deny the major variance. If the Zoning Board of Appeals recommends denial of the major variance, the major variance cannot be approved by the City Council except by the favorable vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of all Aldermen. The City Council may also refer the application back to the Zoning Board of Appeals for further consideration. 
e.  The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the City Council may impose, such conditions and restrictions upon the location, construction, design and use of the property benefited by a variance as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest, adjacent property and property values. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may be imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variance. The terms of relief granted, including any conditions or restrictions, shall be specifically set forth in the ordinance approving the major variance. 
(e)  Findings of Fact. 
(1)  No variance from the provisions of this Ordinance shall be granted unless the Zoning Administrator (administrative variance), the Zoning Board of Appeals (minor variance) and City Council (major variance) makes specific written findings of fact based directly on the standards and conditions imposed by this section. This requirement may be satisfied by incorporating the findings of fact into the meeting minutes of the Zoning Board of Appeals or City Council, the Zoning Administrator's report, the ordinance approving the variance, or other written record. 
These standards are as follows: 
a.  The strict application of the terms of this Zoning Ordinance will result in undue hardship. 
b.  The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances. 
c.  The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
(2)  The Zoning Administrator, Zoning Board of Appeals or City Council, in making its findings of fact, may inquire into the following evidentiary issues, as well as any others deemed appropriate: 
a.  The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property impose a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out. 
b.  The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having a proprietary interest in the property in question nor by any person in privity with the person having a proprietary interest. 
c.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
d.  The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
e.  The proposed variance is consistent with the spirit and intent of this Ordinance and the adopted Comprehensive Plan. 
f.  The value of the property in question will be substantially reduced if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations governing the district in which it is located. 
(f)  Variance Less Than Requested. A variance less than that requested may be granted by the appropriate administrative body when the record supports the applicant's right to some relief, but not to the entire relief requested. 
(g)  Limitations on Variances. 
(1)  A variance shall expire and be of no further effect unless application for a zoning certificate is made within twelve (12) months of the grant of the variance; and 
(2)  Construction, pursuant to a building permit has been commenced within twelve (12) months of the grant; and 
(3)  An occupancy certificate is obtained and a use is commenced within twenty-four (24) months of the grant. 
The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant additional extensions of time, not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days each, upon written application made within the initial time periods without further notice or hearing. However, this power to so extend the time period shall not include the power to grant additional relief by expanding the scope of the variance. 
(h)  Limitations on Denials. If an application for a variance has been denied, by either the City Council or the Zoning Board of Appeals, no application for substantially the same variance may be filed for a period of one (1) year from that date of denial. Whether the application is for "substantially the same" variance shall be within the discretion of the Zoning Administrator.

(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008; Ord. No. 2016-49 , § 3, 7-5-2016; Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 2, 6-19-2017) 
4.6 - Special use. 
(a)  Purpose. The development and execution of a Zoning Ordinance is based upon the division of the City into districts. Within each district the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land, are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are specific uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such uses may be either public or private, and are of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
(b)  Initiation. Applications for special uses may be filed by an owner of any property in the City for that property to use that land for one (1) or more of the special uses provided for in this Ordinance within the zoning district in which the land is situated or to change an existing special use. 
(c)  Authority and Execution. The City Council, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall take formal action on special use requests. 
(d)  Procedure. Applications for special uses shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the requirements in Section 3.2 (Application). Upon receiving a complete application, the Zoning Administrator shall schedule the application for consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission. (See Appendix B for Flowchart 4: Special Use Process.) 
1.  Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
a.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a public hearing on a proposed special use in accordance with Section 3.4 (Public Hearing) no more than sixty (60) days of receipt of a complete application. Notice for the public hearing shall be in accordance with Section 3.3 (Public Notice). If, in the Planning and Zoning Commission's judgment, the application does not contain sufficient information to enable the Commission to properly discharge its responsibilities, the Commission may request additional information from the applicant. In that event, the sixty-day period shall be suspended pending receipt of all requested information. 
b.  Following a public hearing on an application for special use, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall vote to recommend approval or approval with conditions or to recommend denial of the special use. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall, within forty-five (45) days of the close of the public hearing, forward its recommendation to the City Council together with the minutes of the hearing and the Commission's findings of fact. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make findings of fact, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant to each of the applicable standards in Paragraph (e) (Findings of Fact) below and the standards of Section 4.5(d) (Standards for Site Plan Review). 
2.  Action by the City Council. The City Council shall consider the special use within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation. The City Council shall have the authority to approve the special use by enactment of an ordinance, with or without conditions, or to deny the special use. If the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends denial of the special use permit, the special use permit cannot be approved by the City Council except by the favorable vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of all Aldermen. In granting any special use, the City Council may require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary to assure compliance with the stipulated conditions. The City Council may refer the application back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration. 
3.  Conditions on Special Uses. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend, and the City Council may impose, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as may be deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. 
(e)  Findings of Fact. 
(1)  No special use shall be recommended for approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless it has made findings of fact, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, to support each of the following conclusions: 
a.  The establishment, maintenance and operation of the special use in the specific location proposed will not endanger the public health, safety or general welfare of any portion of the community. 
b.  The proposed special use is compatible with adjacent properties and other property within the immediate vicinity of the special use. 
c.  The special use in the specific location proposed is consistent with the spirit and intent of this Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  The Planning and Zoning Commission, in making findings of fact, may inquire into the following evidentiary issues, as well as any others it determines to be appropriate: 
a.  Whether property values in the immediate vicinity of the special use will be diminished or impaired. 
b.  Ingress and egress to the subject property and its proposed structures, with particular attention to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, including access by emergency vehicles. 
c.  Off-street parking and loading areas proposed for the special use, with particular attention to the location and adequacy of such facilities. 
d.  The operational characteristics of the proposed special use and their effects on adjacent properties. Particular attention shall be given to the hours of operation, noise, glare, odor, refuse storage and other relevant environmental factors. 
e.  Utilities and storm drainage facilities as proposed, with reference to their location, availability, adequacy and compatibility. 
f.  Screening, landscaping and buffering, with specific reference to the type proposed, the dimensions and character, and the effectiveness in shielding adjacent properties. 
g.  Signs and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety and compatibility and harmony with adjacent properties. 
h.  The quantity and degree of deviation from the applicable requirements of the district in which the subject property is located, as balanced against the desirability of the special use. 
(3)  The findings of fact requirement may be satisfied by incorporating the findings of fact into the meeting minutes of the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council, the Zoning Administrator's report, the ordinance approving a special use permit, or other written record. 
(f)  No Presumption of Approval. The listing of a use as a special use within a zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such special use will be approved. Rather each proposed special use shall be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to all applicable standards of this Ordinance. Such evaluation will determine whether approval of the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner proposed. 
(g)  Limitations on Special Uses. 
(1)  If work on the proposed development has not begun within two (2) years from the date the special use was granted by the City Council, the special use shall become null and void and all rights granted pursuant to the special use shall lapse. Upon written application, filed with the Zoning Administrator prior to the expiration of the two (2) year time limit, the City Council may authorize not more than one (1) extension for a period of not more than one (1) additional year. 
(2)  Whenever an existing special use is changed to or replaced by a permitted use, or whenever a special use is discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive months, or where there is evidence of a clear intent on the part of the owner of the special use to abandon same, the special use shall become null and void and all rights thereunder shall lapse. In the case where a special use is discontinued, upon written application filed with the Zoning Administrator prior to the expiration of the six (6) month time limit, the City Council may authorize not more than one (1) extension for a period of not more than six (6) additional months. 
(3)  Modification of an element of an existing special use which is material to its nature (such as structural change, relocation or change in use) shall be authorized only in accordance with the same procedures as those required by this Ordinance for a new special use. 
(h)  Limitations on Denials. If an application for a special use has been denied, no application for substantially the same special use may be filed for a period of one (1) year from that date of denial. Whether the application is for "substantially the same" special use shall be within the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. 
(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008; Ord. No. 2011-61, 11-21-2011; Ord. No. 2016-49 , §§ 4-6, 7-5-2016) 
4.7 - Planned development. 
    Where permitted within district regulations, planned developments shall be considered special uses, and subject to the process and requirements of both special uses (Section 4.6 (Special Uses) above) and planned developments. See Section 5 (Planned Developments) of this Ordinance for planned development process and requirements. 
4.8 - Zoning amendment. 
(a)  Purpose. The regulations imposed and the districts created by this Ordinance may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Section. This process for amending the Zoning Ordinance text or the Zoning Map is intended to permit modifications in response to changed conditions or changes in City policy. Amendments are not intended to relieve particular hardships or confer special privileges or rights upon any person or party. 
(b)  Initiation. Applications for zoning amendments (text or map amendments) may be filed by the City or by an owner of any property that is in the City. 
(c)  Procedure. Applications shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2 (Application). Upon receiving a complete application, the Zoning Administrator shall schedule the application for consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission.

A planned development shall be granted in accordance with the procedures and standards of this Section, and the special use provisions of Section 4.6 (Special Use). Unless specifically approved by the ordinance granting or amending the planned development as a special use, the requirements of the underlying district shall apply. The ordinance granting or amending the planned development as a special use may depart from the normal procedures, standards and other requirements of this Ordinance. Planned developments are not intended to serve as a means by which an applicant seeks to circumvent normal zoning or other land use regulations.

5.5 - Exceptions from district regulations. 
(a)  The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council may grant exceptions to the district bulk regulations where a planned development is located. The planned development is subject to the underlying district regulations unless such exception is granted. Exceptions from district regulations may be granted for planned developments with respect to height, density, bulk regulations and setbacks, off street parking and loading, landscaping and screening and signage, if the City Council finds that allowing such exceptions: 
(1)  Enhances the overall merit of the planned development. 
(2)  Promotes the objectives of both the City and the development. 
(3)  Enhances the quality of the design of the structures and the site plan. 
(4)  Enables the development to offer environmental and pedestrian amenities. 
(5)  Will not cause such an adverse impact on neighboring properties so as to outweigh the benefits of the development. 
(6)  Is compatible with the land use policies of the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
(7)  Provides a public benefit to the City, as described in Paragraph C below. 
(b)  The planned development is subject to the underlying district use regulations unless the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends and the City Council permits uses other than those allowed within the district when it is determined by the City Council to be desirable in achieving the objectives of the planned development. However, there must be clear evidence that such uses: 
(1)  Are desirable and appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development; and 
(2)  are not of such a nature, or so located, as to exercise a detrimental influence on the development or the surrounding neighborhood.

Exceptions to district regulations may be granted where it is determined that such modifications shall not negatively affect the value and enjoyment of surrounding property, the provision of municipal services, or the flow of traffic. To be granted such exceptions, the planned development applicant must demonstrate superior design and enhanced amenities. In no case shall an exception to district regulations within a planned development be granted unless the applicant demonstrates a substantial benefit to the City. Design characteristics and amenities to be considered in this determination shall include, but are not limited to the following:

(a)  Location of Districts. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance are set forth in the Official Zoning Map, as periodically amended. The Official Zoning Map is incorporated into, and made an integral part of, this Ordinance. 
It is the intent of this Ordinance that the entire area of the City, including all land and water areas, be included in the zoning districts established by this Ordinance. Any land lying within the City, but not shown on the Official Zoning Map as being included within a district, shall be classified as the R-2 Single-Family Residential District. 
(b)  Interpretation of Boundary Lines. 
(1)  Right-of-Way Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with streets, alleys, highways, easements, or right-of-way lines of railroads, toll roads or expressways, the boundary line shall be construed to be the centerline of the right-of-way. 
(2)  Property Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a recorded property line, the property line shall be construed to be the boundary line of the district. 
(3)  Scaled Lines. Where the district boundary lines do not coincide with a right-of-way line or recorded property line, the district boundary shall be determined by measuring such boundary line(s) by using the map scale as provided on the Official Zoning Map. 
(4)  Clarification of Boundary Lines. The Zoning Administrator shall decide all interpretations of zoning district boundary lines, where the application of Paragraphs 1 through 3 above leaves doubt as to the boundary between two (2) zoning districts.

(c)  Public buildings, structures and facilities, and essential privately-owned utility transmission equipment are exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance. However, prior to the construction, relocation or enlargement of any public building, structure or facility, or any off-street parking facility by the City, plans shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for comment. Such structures shall be designed so that the location of entrances and exits, exterior lighting, service areas, and parking and loading facilities will minimize traffic congestion, pedestrian hazards, and adverse impacts on adjoining properties. The Planning and Zoning Commission may also require additional landscaping and screening, including the fencing requirements of Section 11.4.E.4 (Fences for Public Utility and Public Recreational Uses). 
Section 7 - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 

7.1 - Residential districts purpose. 
(a)  Purpose of R-1 Single-Family Residential District. The R-1 Single-Family Residential District is intended to create a low density environment of single-family homes located upon larger sites than the typical single-family lot size for such housing within the community, where the maintenance of adequate open space is seen as essential to the preservation of the unique residential character. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted. 
(b)  Purpose of R-2 Single-Family Residential District. The R-2 Single-Family Residential District is intended to create a low density environment of single-family homes in areas clearly distinguishable as residential neighborhoods, located upon sites comparable in dimensions to the typical lot size for single-family housing within the community. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted. 
(c)  Purpose of R-3 Two-Family Residential District. The R-3 Two-Family Residential District is intended to create a moderate density environment of single-family homes and two-family dwellings located along major streets upon sites comparable in dimensions to the typical lot size for single-family housing within the community. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted. 
(d)  Purpose of R-4 Multi-Family Residential District. The R-4 Multi-Family Residential District is intended to create a moderate density environment of single-family homes, two-family dwellings and multi-family dwellings, including townhomes. This district may provide a transition zone between single-family neighborhoods and adjacent higher intensity land uses, and should have access to major streets or public transportation facilities. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted. 
(e)  Purpose of R-5 Multi-Family Residential District. The R 5 Multi-Family Residential District is intended to create a higher density environment of single-family homes, two-family dwellings and multi-family dwellings, including townhomes and apartments, located in the Central Business District, or for the R-5 District created on or before May 1, 2008, that is adjacent to the Central Business District. Areas within this district should be adjacent to major streets or convenient to public transportation facilities. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008)

1 For a conversion chart that provides the approximate density for each residential district, as calculated from minimum lot area, see Appendix D. 
2 For nonconforming lots of record within the residential districts, see Section 15.5 (Nonconforming Lots of Record). 
3 Day care homes and day care centers are exempt from the special use bulk requirements. These uses shall be subject to those for single-family residential uses within the district. 
4 Appurtenances for single-family and two-family dwellings within the residential districts are limited to 5 feet in height and a maximum area of 3 feet by 3 feet. The maximum area of an appurtenance shall be determined by measuring the largest cross-section of the appurtenance. 
5 Maximum height of first floor elevation shall be measured from grade, as defined in this Ordinance, to the top of the finished first floor. 
6 In some cases between certain districts and/or uses, a transition yard may be required. Such transition yard may require additional landscaping and screening, as well as a larger yard dimension to accommodate these plantings. Such transition yards shall be as required by Section 13 (Landscaping and Screening). 
7 In no case shall averaging be based on less than four neighboring lots. For example, in the case of a corner lot, four neighboring lots on the same block shall be used or, in the case of a lot adjacent to the corner lot, the corner lot and three neighboring lots on the same block shall be used. In the case of an addition to the front of a house, the front setback of the subject property shall be included (prior to the addition), along with the neighboring properties as noted above. 
8 In the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Districts, the rear yard dimension is determined by lot type (corner lot versus interior lot). In the R-4 and R-5 Districts, the rear yard dimension is the same regardless of lot type. See Section 16 (Definitions) for description of lot types. 
(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008; Ord. No. 2009-50, 7-6-2009) 
7.4 - General standards of applicability. 
(a)  Temporary Uses . See Section 10.4 (Temporary Uses) for standards governing temporary uses. 
(b)  Accessory Buildings, Structures, and Uses . See Section 11.4 (Accessory Buildings, Structures and Uses) for standards covering accessory buildings, structures and uses. Attached garages shall not be considered an accessory structure but shall be subject to the requirements of Section 11.4.F.2 (Attached Garages). 
(c)  Permitted Encroachments . See Section 11.5 (Permitted Encroachments) for standards governing encroachments. 
(d)  Environmental Performance Standards. See Section 11.6 (Environmental Performance Standards) for standards governing environmental performance standards.

(g)  Signs. See Section 14 (Signs) for standards governing signs. 
7.5 - Floor area ratio measurement and bonus applicability. 
(a)  Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Calculation . Floor area ratio (FAR) shall be determined by dividing the gross floor area of a building or buildings on a lot by the total lot area. 
(b)  Gross Floor Area Calculation . To determine the gross floor area for the purposes of the FAR calculation, as described in Paragraph A above, the gross floor area shall be the sum of the gross horizontal areas of any building, as measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating two (2) buildings. In addition, the following shall also be included in the gross floor area calculation: 
(1)  That part of the floor area where the height from floor to ceiling is in excess of twelve (12) feet shall be counted twice. 
(2)  The basement floor area when more than half of the basement height is above the established finished grade. 
(3)  Elevator shafts and stairwells at each floor. 
(4)  Floor space used for mechanical equipment. This shall not include roof-top equipment. 
(5)  Penthouses. 
(6)  That floor area of attic space or the second story of a detached garage that has headroom of seven (7) feet or more. Only the floor area with a height of seven (7) feet or more shall be counted. 
(7)  Enclosed balconies and mezzanines. 
(8)  Enclosed porches. 
(9)  Accessory structures located on the lot, except for that floor area permitted to be excluded from the gross floor area calculation, as described in Paragraph C below. 
(c)  Exceptions to Gross Floor Area Calculation: 
(1)  Unenclosed Porches . Unenclosed front entry porches shall be eligible for a floor area exemption as described in this section. In order to qualify for this exemption, unenclosed porches shall be no more than one (1) story in height, shall not be enclosed or used for year-around living, shall not have a solid railing, and shall have a minimum depth of four (4) feet as measured from the edge of the porch to the front façade of the principal structure at the shallowest point of the porch, not including steps and stoops. 
Qualifying unenclosed porches shall be granted the following floor area exemptions: 
a.  Where a porch extends for a width of fifty percent (50%) or more of the front façade along the front yard, up to one-hundred (100) square feet shall be excluded from the total gross floor area. 
b.  Where a porch extends for a width of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the façade along the corner side yard, up to one-hundred (100) square feet shall be excluded from the total gross floor area. 
c.  For corner lots, with a qualifying porch along both the front yard and corner side yard façades, up to a total of two-hundred (200) square feet may be excluded from the total gross floor area. 
(2)  Accessory Structures . Certain accessory structures shall be eligible for a floor area exemption as described in this section. Certain accessory structures shall be granted the following exemptions: 
a.  Sheds of one-hundred twenty (120) square feet or less of total floor area not be included in the total gross floor area. 
b.  Detached garages of four-hundred (400) square feet or less of total floor area and located entirely within the rear thirty (30) feet of the lot shall not be included in the total gross floor area. If a detached garage located in the rear yard exceeds four-hundred (400) square feet in area, the first four-hundred (400) square feet shall be excluded from the total gross floor area, but the remainder of the garage's floor area shall be included in the calculation 1 . Regardless, that floor area of the second story of a detached garage that has headroom of seven (7) feet or more shall be counted in the total floor area. 
(d)  Floor Area Bonus for Certain Additions in R-1 and R-2 Districts . Additional floor area for proposed additions to existing single-family homes constructed before January 1, 1960 in the R-1 and R-2 Districts shall be permitted, subject to the rules and conditions of this section and any other provisions of this subsection. 
(1)  Purpose of Floor Area Bonus . The floor area bonus for existing single-family homes within the R-1 or R-2 Districts is intended to preserve the existing housing stock and maintain the established character of single-family neighborhoods. By preserving older homes, this may create additional affordable housing opportunities as well. 
(2)  Maximum Additional Floor Area . The maximum bonus FAR permitted for an existing single-family home in the R-1 and R-2 Districts shall be 0.03, not to exceed a total maximum FAR in these districts for single-family homes of 0.48. 
(3)  Rules and Conditions . The following rules and conditions shall be used to determine if the property is eligible for the additional floor area: 
a.  The proposed addition shall be attached to an existing building, for which a building permit was issued prior to January 1, 1960. 
b.  The original foundation of the structure at the time the original building permit was issued must be maintained. If the original foundation has been partially removed or destroyed since the original construction, such structure is not eligible for the FAR bonus. 
c.  Demolition. 
i.  No demolition activity to the structure located on or above the original foundation shall be permitted during the construction of the addition, except that necessary to construct the addition, such as the demolition of a wall for room expansion. 
ii.  Demolition of additions to the structure, whose foundations are expansions of the original foundation but not part of the original foundation, shall be permitted. 
iii.  Demolition of accessory structures, which are not part of the original building foundation, such as detached garages and porches, shall be permitted. 
d.  With the exception of FAR, the existing single-family homes and the proposed addition will be in compliance with all applicable bulk regulations. When the FAR is calculated after the construction of the proposed addition, the FAR shall not exceed that permitted by-right plus the bonus provision (0.48). 
e.  In the case of demolition of the entire structure, even if the original foundation is not removed, the new structure shall not be eligible for the FAR bonus. The FAR bonus applies only to structures constructed before January 1, 1960, and not to the zoning lot. 
(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008) 
7.6 - Measurement of reverse corner side yard. 
    To clarify the distinction between a corner lot and a reverse corner lot, and to clarify how to measure a reverse corner side yard, the following illustrations (Figures 1, 2 and 3) are provided: 
(a)  For reference, a typical corner lot is a lot situated at the junction of, and abutting, two (2) or more intersecting streets. See Figure 1: Corner Lot below. 
FIGURE 1: CORNER LOT

(b)  A reverse corner lot is a corner lot where the side lot line adjoining a street is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the first lot to its rear. See Figure 2: Reverse Corner Lot below. 

(c)  How to measure the reverse corner side yard of a reverse corner lot is illustrated in Figure 3: Measurement of Reverse Corner Side Yard below. The dimension of such yard is as required in Table 3: Residential Districts Yard and Bulk Regulations. 
FIGURE 3: MEASUREMENT OF REVERSE CORNER SIDE YARD 
FIGURE 3-STEP 1: On a reverse corner lot, the lot line used to determine the location of the front yard and to measure lot width shall be the shorter street frontage. 

FIGURE 3 - STEP 2: As measured from the rear lot line of the reverse corner lot, the first twenty (20) feet of the reverse corner side yard shall equal the front yard of the lot to the rear. The remainder of the reverse corner side yard shall be fifty percent (50%) of the front yard depth or a dimension established by district regulations. 

Section 8 - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS 

8.1 - Commercial districts purpose. 
(a)  Purpose of O Office District. The O Office District is intended to create a commercial environment of a non-retail nature for the development of office structures and related uses, within a well landscaped setting. Areas within this district should have access to major streets or public transportation facilities. 
(b)  Purpose of B-1 Retail and Office District. The B-1 Retail and Office District is intended to provide an environment suitable for a variety of retail, service, office and mixed (residential above ground-floor commercial) uses. Additionally, this district is intended to accommodate uses that: provide for the needs of local residents; are oriented to pedestrian access; generate relatively minimal vehicular traffic; and have minimal off-street parking demands. Areas within the district should have access to major streets and/or public transportation and may be located adjacent to residential districts. 
(c)  Purpose of B-2 General Commercial District. The B-2 General Commercial District is intended to provide an environment suitable for a variety of retail, service and office uses that have higher traffic, illumination and other operational impacts on surrounding areas than those in the B-1 District. Additionally, this district is intended to accommodate uses that: serve both local and regional patrons; are oriented to the demands of heavy vehicular traffic, and provide for relatively high off-street parking demands. Ideally, areas within this district should be adjacent to major streets and should be either physically separated or adequately buffered from R-1 and R-2 residential areas. 
(d)  Purpose of B-3 General Commercial, Wholesale and Service District. The B-3 General Commercial, Wholesale and Service District is intended to provide appropriate locations for specialized general commercial uses, including wholesaling, equipment storage and a variety of business services, which are oriented toward supporting other retail goods and personal service establishments, and not necessarily focused upon the shopping public. Areas within this district should have direct access to major streets and be generally situated in locations removed or buffered from residential uses. 
(e)  Purpose of B-4 Uptown Business District. The B-4 Uptown Business District is intended to sustain the current commercial, pedestrian-oriented character and economic viability of the central business district. New development will be consistent with the Uptown's established scale, architecture and mix of uses. In order to refine the regulations for this district, a series of sub-districts with corresponding use and bulk regulations have been established, as described in Section 8.2 (B-4 District Sub-Districts) below. 
(Ord. No. 2017-23 , § 2, 4-5-2017) 
8.2 - B-4 uptown business district sub-districts. 
    Because various areas of Uptown have different mixes of uses, physical characteristics and functions, the City has identified four (4) sub-districts, each with its own set of allowable uses and bulk regulations. The sub-districts are identified on the Official Zoning Map. The general purpose and intent of each sub-district is described below. 
(a)  Purpose of the Uptown Core Sub-District. The Uptown Core Sub-District (U-Core) is the traditional center of the City's Central Business District. The U-Core Sub-District is intended to preserve buildings located within the Central Business District that are of architectural significance, and ensure the new development is compatible with and maintains the historical character of the core. The U-Core Sub-District is characterized by a mix of small retail and service uses within a mixed-use pedestrian-oriented environment. Retail, restaurant and entertainment uses shall be located along the ground floor, with personal service, office and residential above. 
(b)  Purpose of the Uptown Commercial Sub-District. The Uptown Commercial Sub-District (U-Comm) is intended to support the Uptown Core with a mixed-use environment. The mix of uses and the bulk regulations within this sub-district are structured to relate directly to the Uptown Core, but are distinct in that they allow service uses on the ground floor. This sub-district is also designed to be pedestrian-oriented. 
(c)  Purpose of the Transitional Commercial Sub-District. The Transitional Commercial Sub-District (U-TC) is intended as a transitional area, where low-intensity office buffer surrounding single-family neighborhoods from the U-Core Sub-District. The mix of uses includes primarily low intensity office and institutional uses, including on-site parking and open space. 
(d)  Purpose of the Public/Institutional Sub-District. The Public/Institutional Sub-District (U-P/I) is intended to accommodate existing public, open space and institutional uses, including government offices. These public and institutional uses offer important community services, and provide a focal point and civic character for Park Ridge and the Uptown Business District. 
8.3 - Permitted and special uses. 
Table 4: Commercial Districts Permitted and Special Uses lists permitted and special uses for the commercial districts. A "P" indicates that a use is considered permitted within that district. An "S" indicates that a use is considered a special use in that district and must obtain special use approval as required in Section 4.6 (Special Use). No letter (i.e., a blank space), or the absence of the use from the table, indicates that use is not permitted within that district.

Section 9 - SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS 

9.1 - Special purpose districts purpose. 
(a)  Purpose of OS Open Space Special Purpose District. The Open Space Special Purpose District (OS) is intended to provide and protect publicly and privately owned open space, natural areas, and passive and active recreation facilities that serve the City and surrounding region. 
(b)  Purpose of H Hospital Special Purpose District. The Hospital Special Purpose District (H) is intended to address the special needs and impacts of a large-scale, multi-functional hospital and medical campus. The Hospital District is divided into three sub-districts - Hospital Transition Zone 1, Hospital Transition Zone 2 and Hospital Core Zone. These sub-districts progressively increase in intensity of use and bulk. This progression is intended to mitigate the impacts of a hospital campus on adjacent residential uses. 
(1)  Hospital Core Zone. Hospital Core Zone (H-CZ) is intended to accommodate the main hospital structure and related uses. This sub-district is the most intense within the H District. 
(2)  Hospital Transition Zone 1. Hospital Transition Zone 1 (H-TZ-1) is intended to serve as the immediate transition between neighboring residential uses. It is primarily a landscaped transition yard, though surface parking lots may be allowed as a special use. No principal structures are permitted in this sub-district. 
(3)  Hospital Transition Zone 2. Hospital Transition Zone 2 (H-TZ-2) is intended to serve as a secondary buffer against neighboring residential uses. The H-TZ-2 Sub-District allows for some freestanding smaller-scale medical-related uses with individual yard requirements for each structure. 
(c)  Purpose of EB Educational Boarding Special Purpose District. The Educational Boarding Special Purpose District (EB) is intended to address the special needs and impacts of a large-scale, educational facility and campus that includes boarding facilities for students. The Educational Boarding District is divided into two sub-districts - EB Transition Zone and EB Core Zone. 
(1)  Educational Boarding Core Zone. Educational Boarding Core Zone (EB-CZ) is intended to accommodate a large-scale educational facility, including classrooms and dorms, and related uses such as parking and outdoor recreation. 
(2)  Educational Boarding Transition Zone. Educational Boarding Transition Zone (EB-TZ) is intended to serve as the buffer with respect to neighboring residential uses and provides a landscaped transition yard between the facility and the abutting residential uses. No principal structures are permitted in this sub-district. 
(d)  Purpose of S Sexually-Oriented Business Special Purpose District. The Sexually-Oriented Business Special Purpose District (S) is intended to provide a limited area in which to operate a sexually-oriented business. The S District is a floating zone, which will not be designated on the Zoning Map until an application is made and a recommendation is made by action of the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the City Council. An S District is the only zoning district in which a sexually-oriented business may be operated. 
(e)  Purpose of P Parking Special Purpose District. The Parking District (P) is intended to create an area adjacent to the existing B-1 District for off-street parking that must be designed to be compatible with adjacent residential areas. The parking areas are to be used solely for off-street parking lots by passenger vehicles incidental to a principal use. The district is intended to serve as parking for an adjacent use, or uses, which has previously been developed without adequate off-street parking facilities. 
9.2 - Permitted and special uses. 
Table 6: Special Purpose Districts Permitted and Special Uses lists permitted and special uses for the special purpose districts. A "P" indicates that a use is considered permitted within that district. An "S" indicates that a use is considered a special use in that district and must obtain special use approval as required in Section 4.6 (Special Use). No letter (i.e., a blank space), or the absence of the use from the table, indicates that use is not permitted within that district.

11.6 - Environmental performance standards. 
    All uses shall comply with the performance standards established in this section unless any federal, state, county or local law, ordinance or regulation establishes a more restrictive standard, in which case, the more restrictive standard shall apply. 
(a)  Noise. No activity or use shall be conducted in a manner that generates a level of sound as measured on another property greater than that allowed by federal, state and local regulations, as amended from time to time. These limits shall not apply to construction noises, noises emanating from safety signals or warning devices, noises not directly under the control of the owner or occupant of the property, and transient noises from moving sources, such as motor vehicles, railroads and aircraft. 
(b)  Glare and Heat. Any activity or the operation of any use that produces glare or heat shall be conducted so that no glare or heat from the activity or operation shall be detectable at any point off the lot on which the use is located. Flickering or intense sources of light shall be controlled or shielded so as not to cause a nuisance across lot lines. 
(c)  Vibration. No earthborne vibration from the operation of any use shall be detectable at any point off the lot on which the use is located. 
(d)  Dust and Air Pollution. Dust and other types of air pollution, borne by the wind from sources, such as storage areas, yards, roads, conveying equipment and the like, within lot boundaries, shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, screening, sheltering, paving, fencing, wetting, collecting or other acceptable means. 
(e)  Discharge and Disposal of Radioactive and Hazardous Waste. The discharge of fluid and the disposal of solid radioactive and hazardous waste materials shall comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations governing such materials or waste. No operation that produces radioactive or hazardous waste material shall commence without prior notice to the City. Notice shall be given at least three (3) weeks before the operation is commenced. Radioactive and hazardous material waste shall be transported, stored, and used in conformance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. 
(f)  Electromagnetic Interference. Electromagnetic interference from any operation of any use in any district shall not adversely affect the operation of any equipment located off the lot on which such interference originates. 
(g)  Odors. Any condition or operation which results in the creation of odors of such intensity and character as to be detrimental to the health and welfare of the public, or which interferes unreasonably with the comfort of the public, shall be removed, stopped or modified so as to remove the odor. 
(h)  Toxic Substances. The storage, handling, or transport of toxic substances shall comply with federal, state and local regulations. 
(i)  Water Pollution. All uses shall comply with federal, state and local regulations.

Section 12 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

12.1 - Purpose. 
    The off-street parking and loading regulations of this Section are intended to provide accessible, attractive, secure and well-maintained off-street parking and loading areas with the appropriate number of spaces in proportion to the needs of the proposed use, increase public safety by reducing congestion of public streets, and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation where appropriate. 
12.2 - General provisions. 
    The provisions of this Section shall apply as follows: 
(a)  Existing Facilities. 
(1)  The existing number of off-street parking and loading spaces shall not be reduced below the requirements of this Section. If the number of such existing spaces is already less than the requirements of this Section, it shall not be further reduced. 
(2)  Existing off-street parking and loading areas which do not conform to the requirements of this Section, but were in conformance with the requirements of this Ordinance at the time the parking or loading facilities were established, are permitted to continue as a legal nonconforming structure. 
(3)  If a building permit for a building or structure was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and if construction has begun within one-hundred eighty (180) days of the issuance of a permit, the number of off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in the amount required for the issuance of said building permit, regardless of what may be required by this Section. 
(b)  Damage or Destruction. When a building is reconstructed or repaired after being damaged or destroyed, off-street parking and loading facilities shall be restored or maintained in an amount equivalent to that at the time of such damage or destruction. However, it shall not be necessary to restore or maintain parking and loading facilities in excess of the applicable requirements of this Section. 
(c)  Change in Land Use. When the existing use of a building, structure or parcel of land is changed to a new use, parking and loading spaces shall be provided as required for the new use. Additional parking or loading spaces shall be required in the amount by which the requirements for the new use exceed the requirements for the existing use. 
(d)  Change in Intensity of Use. 
(1)  When the intensity of use of any building, structure or parcel of land is increased, additional parking and loading spaces shall be provided. The number of additional parking and loading spaces shall be based on the increase in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement used to calculate the number of required number of parking or loading spaces. 
(2)  When the intensity of use of any building, structure or parcel of land is decreased, the number of parking and loading spaces may be reduced so long as the parking requirements of this Section are met for the entire building, structure or parcel of land as modified. 
(e)  Provision of Additional Spaces. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities, provided that all regulations governing the location, design and control of such facilities shall be in accordance with this Section. 
(f)  Limitations on Use. No motor vehicle repair or cleaning of any kind shall be permitted in any parking space, parking lot or loading berth. No gasoline, motor oil or any other accessory or similar product shall be sold or dispensed in such areas. 
12.3 - Computation. 
    The total number of required parking and loading spaces shall be based upon the requirements for the principal use of the lot. However, when more than one (1) use occupies the same lot, the number of required spaces shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each use. All off-street parking facilities shall be completed before occupancy of the building or structure served. In computing the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required by this Section, the following standards for computation shall apply: 
(a)  Space allocated to any off-street loading space shall not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street parking space or access aisle, or portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street parking space shall not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-street loading space or portion thereof. 
(b)  A fraction of less than one-half (1/2) may be disregarded, and a fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall be counted as one (1) parking or loading space. 
(c)  In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or similar seating facilities, each eighteen (18) inches of such seating facility shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for off-street parking facilities. 
(d)  Except as otherwise specified, parking or loading spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees normally present on the premises at any one time. When the determination of the number of parking spaces is based on the number of employees, the owner and/or manager shall be counted as an employee(s). 
12.4 - Construction of parking and loading facilities. 
(a)  Site plan review required. Site plan review, in accordance with Section 4.5 (Site Plan Review), is required prior to any construction, alteration or addition of any parking facility providing ten (10) or more parking spaces, and for any loading facility. For purposes of this section, construction, alteration or addition shall include all paving of previously unpaved surfaces, replacement of pavement with new binder and surface courses, construction of curbing, installation of new parking lot landscaping, and similar activities. Construction, alteration or addition shall not include maintenance activities such as replacement of existing landscaping, repair of existing curbing, repairs, sealing, re-striping, or placement of surface course pavement over previously paved areas. No permit shall be required for maintenance activities. 
(b)  Time of completion. Off-street parking and loading facilities required by this Section shall be completed prior to the issuance of the occupancy permit for the use they serve. If weather conditions do not permit such completion, the Zoning Administrator may issue a temporary occupancy certificate. 
12.5 - Collective provisions. 
(a)  Off-street parking spaces for individual uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces provided is equal to or greater than the sum of the spaces required for each individual use. No parking space, or portion of a space, shall serve as the required space for more than one similar use, but can be shared among two or more individual uses under the following shared parking arrangements described in Paragraph B below. 
(b)  The use of a particular parking facility shall not occur by each use at the same time. The use with the highest demand must provide all required spaces. No shared use of parking spaces shall be permitted unless: 
(1)  The users of the shared parking facility shall sign an agreement, approved by the City Attorney, expressing the intent to share parking facilities. This agreement shall be filed with the City and recorded with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. 
(2)  Approval is obtained from the Zoning Administrator that confirms that the use of such facility by each user does not take place at the same hours during the same days of the week. 
(3)  The location and design requirements of this Section are met. 
(4)  Any subsequent change in ownership or use shall require proof that the minimum parking requirements, per this Section, have been met for each use. The owner of a building or use shall have one-hundred eighty (180) days within which to accommodate all required off-street parking or to apply for a variance. If the owner is unable to accommodate the parking or fails to apply for a variance, then the occupancy certificate shall be revoked with respect to the building or use for which the separate parking was required. The occupancy certificate shall be reinstated when all applicable provisions of this Section are complied with. As an alternative to a variance, a new shared parking agreement may be arranged in accordance with this Section. 
(Ord. No. 2008-65, 9-2-2008) 
12.6 - Land banked future parking. 
    The Planning and Zoning Commission may permit land banking of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the required parking spaces through the site plan review process. 
(a)  Sufficient evidence shall be provided by the applicant that supports the reduced parking needs. 
(b)  The area proposed for land banking of parking spaces shall be an area suitable for parking at a future time. 
(c)  Landscaping of the land banked area shall be in full compliance of the zoning regulations and at a minimum landscaped with turf. As a result of the site plan review process, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require additional landscaping of the land-banked area. 
(d)  The land banking area cannot be used for any other use without amendment of the site plan. 
(e)  As part of the site plan review process, the applicant shall show the area to be banked on the site plan and marked as "land banked future parking." 
(f)  The Zoning Administrator, on the basis of increased parking demand for the use, shall require the conversion of all or part of the land-banked area to off-street parking spaces. 
12.7 - Location of off-street parking spaces. 
(a)  Residential Uses. 
(1)  All required parking spaces for residential uses shall be located on the same lot as the building or use served. 
(2)  For single- and two-family dwellings, parking shall be permitted in private driveways, but no such parking may encroach onto the public right-of-way. However, such driveway parking shall not be considered as satisfying the off street parking requirements for such single- and two-family dwellings as set forth in this Section, except for existing structures within the R-3 District where parking shall be permitted in private driveways and may count toward the required number of off-street parking spaces, but no such parking may encroach onto the public right-of-way. 
(3)  No less than fifty percent (50%) of all required parking in a residential district shall be provided in a completely enclosed building. However, parking located beneath a structure that is no less than four (4) feet below grade, as defined by this Ordinance, may be unenclosed, but must be screened from the public right-of-way by landscaping.

Such spaces shall comply with the design standards presented in the State of Illinois Accessibility Code, provided that in no instance shall the width of any one (1) space be less than sixteen (16) feet. Such spaces shall be identified by a sign and pavement markings indicating parking for the disabled only. Such spaces shall be the spaces closest to the entrance of the building or structure, and shall be connected by a paved surface designed to provide safe and easy access. 
12.10 - Stacking spaces for drive-through facilities. 
(a)  Design. Stacking spaces provided for drive-through uses shall be: 
(1)  A minimum of nine (9) feet in width, as measured from the outermost point of any service window to the edge of the driveway, and eighteen (18) feet in length. (See Figure 14: Measurement of Drive-Through and Figure 15: Stacking Spaces) 
FIGURE 14: MEASUREMENT OF DRIVE-THROUGH 

FIGURE 15: STACKING SPACES 

(2)  Placed in a single line behind the drive-through facility. 
(3)  Located so that, when in use, they do not obstruct ingress or egress to the site and do not obstruct access to required parking or loading spaces. 
(4)  Stacking spaces shall begin behind the vehicle parked at a last point of service, such as a window or car wash bay. 
(b)  Required Spaces. Every drive-through facility shall provide a minimum of three (3) stacking spaces per facility, unless otherwise required by Table 9: Required Off-Street Parking or this Ordinance. 
(c)  Reduction of Required Spaces. The number of required stacking spaces may be reduced by the Planning and Zoning Commission during the site plan review process if the petitioner presents a study done by a traffic engineer with quantifiable evidence (e.g., comparable information) which demonstrates that a different requirement should be imposed. The approval of a reduced number of stacking spaces shall apply only to the specific business for which the study was conducted. 
12.11 - Commercial vehicles. 
    The provisions of these paragraphs apply where off-street parking is accessory to the principal use of the zoning lot. 
(a)  Residential Districts. Off-street parking facilities serving residential uses in any residential district shall be used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles. One (1) truck of eight thousand (8,000) pounds gross vehicle weight (GVW) or less (i.e., Class B license) shall be permitted to park in the interior side or rear yard, except as provided below. 
(1)  No truck of eight thousand (8,000) pounds GVW or less (i.e., Class B license) shall be permitted to park in the front or corner side yard of any residential lot, if the truck: 
a.  Has any tools, equipment, material, machines, debris or any other matter in the open bed. 
b.  Has attached any snowplow, towing winch, or rack or mounting for construction tools or materials. 
c.  Exceeds twenty (20) feet in length, eight (8) feet in height or seven (7) feet in width, or has more than four (4) wheels. 
(2)  A permit may be issued by the Zoning Administrator authorizing one (1) truck of not more than eight thousand (8,000) pounds GVW or less (i.e., Class B license), except for those trucks described in Paragraph (a) above, to be parked in the front or corner side yard of any residential lot, where physical access to an interior side yard or rear yard is unavailable due to one (1) or more of the following factors, to be determined by administrative site plan review: 
a.  There is no rear or side yard access to a public or private alley. 
b.  An existing garage on the premises cannot physically accommodate the truck in question. 
c.  Front, side or rear yards are inadequate due to the placement or configuration of the dwelling on the lot. 
d.  There is no accessible interior side or rear yard of sufficient size and area to accommodate the truck in question. 
In issuing a permit, the Zoning Administrator may attach reasonable conditions, in view of the particular circumstances, and in keeping with the intent of this Section. It remains the intent of this Paragraph to prohibit all truck parking within the front or corner side yard of a residential dwelling except where it is a physical impossibility, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience or financial hardship.

If the vehicles are not within a fully enclosed structure, they may also be permitted when set back a minimum twenty percent (20%) of the lot depth from any lot line that fronts a public street. At lot lines that do not front a public street and where the zoning lot abuts residentially zoned property, the vehicles may be set back a minimum ten percent (10%) of the lot width. In addition, at least one (1) of the following conditions must be met: 
a.  The vehicles are integral to an active principal use on the property and are parked in areas clearly designated and marked for large vehicle parking; or 
b.  The vehicles are engaged in work related to an active building construction or site development project occurring on the zoning lot. 
(3)  Zoning lots with authorized principal uses to sell, rent, or repair vehicles listed in Subparagraph (1) are exempt from the regulations of Subparagraphs (1) and (2). However, these zoning lots are not exempt from the landscaping and screening requirements of Section 13, and conditions may be added as part of a special use permit approval. 
(Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 4, 2-4-2019)

(e)  No recreational vehicle shall be used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes in any zoning district. 
(f)  This section does not apply to recreational vehicles offered for-sale in an approved outdoor sales and display area of a motor vehicle dealership. 
12.13 - Required off-street parking spaces. 
(a)  The minimum number of off-street parking spaces to be provided for the designated uses shall be as follows in Table 9: Off-Street Parking Requirements. Table 9 lists parking requirements for the generic uses listed within the districts.

12.15 - Design of off-street loading spaces. 
(a)  Location. 
(1)  All off-street loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building or use served. No off-street loading spaces shall project into a public right-of-way. 
(2)  Off-street loading spaces shall be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from the intersection of any two (2) streets. 
(3)  No off-street loading space shall be located in a front or corner side yard. 
(4)  All off-street loading spaces shall be located a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the lot line of any lot in a residential district, unless completely enclosed by building walls or a uniformly painted solid fence or wall, or any combination thereof, not less than six (6) feet in height. 
(b)  Dimensions. All required off-street loading spaces shall be at least twelve (12) feet in width and at least thirty (30) feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering space, and shall have a minimum vertical clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet. During site plan review, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require a loading space in excess of thirty (30) feet in length based upon the proposed use and anticipated shipping/delivery methods. In no case, shall the Planning and Zoning Commission require a length in excess of sixty (60) feet. 
(c)  Surfacing. All off-street loading spaces shall be improved in accordance with the requirements of the City Engineer 
(d)  Access Control and Signage. Each required off-street loading space shall be designed with adequate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner that will minimize interference with traffic movement.

Section 13 - LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING 

13.1 - Purpose. 
    The landscaping and screening requirements established by this Section are intended to preserve and enhance the appearance, public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare of the City by fostering an aesthetically pleasing development. Proper landscaping contributes to the City in many ways: enhancing its character and scenic beauty, providing clean air, reducing noise, preventing erosion of topsoil, reducing the rate of stormwater runoff, providing nesting areas for birds and habitat for other wildlife, conserving energy, and providing shade and windbreaks. These regulations are also intended to increase the compatibility of adjacent uses, and minimize the adverse impact of noise, dust, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts conducted on, or created by, adjoining or neighboring uses. 
13.2 - Enforcement of landscape provisions. 
    No building permit or occupancy certificate shall be issued for any lot or use subject to the requirements of this Section unless all the requirements of this Section have been fulfilled. Failure to implement the landscape plan, or to maintain the lot or use in substantial conformance with the landscape plan, shall be cause for revocation of the occupancy certificate and/or the application of fines and penalties, as established in this Ordinance. In addition, all landscaping is subject to periodic inspection by the Zoning Administrator. 
13.3 - Landscape plan. 
(a)  Landscape Plan Required. A detailed landscape plan shall be submitted to the City as part of any new development, and/or special use, planned development or site plan review application, and must be approved prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(b)  Content of Landscape Plan. 
(1)  The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, property lines, easements, parking lots and drives, roadways and rights-of-way, sidewalks, ground signs, refuse disposal and recycling areas, sidewalks, bicycle paths and parking facilities, fences, electrical equipment, recreational facilities, drainage facilities, and other freestanding structures, as determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator. 
(2)  The location, quantity, size, name and condition, both botanical and common, of all existing plant materials, including trees and other material in the right-of-way, and indicating plant material to be retained and removed. 
(3)  The location, quantity, size and name, both botanical and common, of all proposed plant material including, but not limited to, shade and evergreen trees, shrubs, groundcover, annuals/perennials and turf. 
(4)  The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at one (1) foot intervals. Proposed berming shall be indicated using one (1) foot contour intervals. 
(5)  Elevations of all proposed fences, steps, stairs, retaining walls both fixed (cast concrete, unitized walls) and any natural rock outcroppings on the site. 
(6)  Elevations, cross-sections, and other details as determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator. 
(c)  Minor Changes to Approved Landscape Plans. Minor changes to the landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net amount of plant material as specified on the approved landscape plan shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator. Changes to the size and species of plant materials of an approved landscape plan shall not be considered a minor change. Major changes shall be approved by the body granting approval of the landscape plan initially. 
13.4 - Selection, installation and maintenance of plant materials. 
(a)  Selection.

The use of species native to northeastern Illinois shall be encouraged. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria that shall be considered when selecting plant material. Where appropriate, the use of drought and salt tolerant plant material is preferred. 
(b)  Installation. All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with the current planting procedures established by the AANS. All plant materials shall be free of disease and shall be installed so that soil of sufficient volume, composition and nutrient balance are available to sustain healthy growth. 
(c)  Required Element. Landscape materials depicted on landscape plans approved by the City shall be considered to be required site plan elements in the same manner as buildings, parking and other improvements. As such, the owner of record, or in some instances the homeowner's association, shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of all landscape materials, and fences, steps, retaining walls and similar landscaping elements over the entire life of the development. 
(d)  Maintenance. All landscaping materials shall be maintained in good condition, shall present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and shall be kept free of refuse and debris.

(g)  Softening of Walls and Fences. Plant material shall be placed intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences and other barriers to create a softening effect and to help break up long expanses of blank walls with little architectural detail. 
(h)  Planting Beds. Planting beds shall be mulched with shredded hardwood, mushroom compost or decomposed rock chips less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in diameter, feather rocks or similar materials. Lava rock, large river rock or colored stones are not acceptable. 
(i)  Irrigation. Landscape design pursuant to the requirements of this Section shall recognize the need for irrigation and water conservation. Sprinkler irrigation systems may be required for certain landscaped areas, as determined by a landscape architect. The need for sprinkler irrigation systems shall be determined by the type of plant material and the condition/growing medium that they are installed in. For instance, whether there is a permanent means available to water plant material, such as hose bibs, shall be a consideration. All irrigation systems shall be designed to minimize the use of water. 
(j)  Energy Conservation. Plant material placement should be designed to reduce the energy consumption needs of the development. In addition, landscaping designs shall take into account and make an effort to implement LEED policy and design standards, where appropriate. 
(1)  Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun.
