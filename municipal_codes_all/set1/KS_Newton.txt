Any errata officially published by the International Code Council, Inc., shall become part of the International Building Code and/or the International Residential Code when placed on file by the administrative authority.  If any conflict or discrepancy exists between this article and the referenced International Building Code or the International Residential Code, the provisions of this article shall rule.  No fewer than three copies of the International Building Code and of the International Residential Code shall be marked or stamped “Official Copy as Incorporated by Reference by the Code of the City of Newton, Kansas,” with all sections or portions thereof intended to be deleted, changed or amended clearly marked to show such deletion, change or amendment, and to which shall be attached a copy of this ordinance and filed with the city clerk to be open to inspection and available to the public at all reasonable hours.  All administrative departments of the City charged with the enforcement of the ordinance shall be supplied, at the cost of the City, such number of official copies of such International Building Code and International Residential Code similarly marked, deleted and changed as may be expedient.

6-102.        Board of examiners and appeals created, duties.

(a)   In order to determine the suitability of alternate materials and types of construction and to provide for reasonable interpretations of the provisions of this building code, there is hereby created a board of examiners and appeals consisting of five members who are qualified by experience and training to pass upon matters pertaining to building and construction. The board shall consist of two persons appointed at large and if possible having architectural or engineering backgrounds, three contractors, one from Class A, one from Class A, B, or C and one from Class C or D, and the building inspector who shall act as secretary of the board. The city attorney shall act as advisory counsel for the board. The five members shall be appointed by the governing body to serve in the first instance for the following terms: First appointment at large, term of one year; second appointment at large and the Class A contractor, term of two years; for the Class A, B, or C contractor and for the Class C or D contractor, term of three years. All appointments thereafter shall be for terms of three years each.

(b)   The board of examiners and appeals shall hear and determine all appeals from the orders of the administrative authority and act as an arbitration board in deciding any matters that may arise between the administrative authority and any person relative to the interpretation of this article. All proceedings before the board shall be recorded in writing and the determination of the board shall be final.

(c)   Where conditions exist which are not covered by the Uniform Building Code or in which it may be shown that it is impractical to follow the requirements of the same, the board of examiners and appeals may grant variances from the strict application of the Uniform Building Code. The board is further authorized, and it shall be its duty to pass upon materials or methods of installation not specifically provided for in the Uniform Building Code and to accept or reject the same as complying or not complying with the intent of such code. The determination of the board shall be final. The board is further hereby given the responsibility of studying and making recommendations for code amendments relative to the use and installation of any products or materials that are being offered for use in building construction and to review the building code and regulations from time to time and make recommendations for code amendments to the governing body. A copy of such code amendments when they have become effective shall be sent to all persons holding a contractor’s license.

(d)   Any person who wishes an appeal or a variance from the building code shall submit a written application to the administrative authority. The application shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount of $20 payable to the city. Such fee shall be retained by the city regardless of the outcome of the hearing. Any application for a variance shall be submitted at least seven days in advance of any regular meeting of the board in order to be considered at such regular meeting. The applicant and/or the applicant’s representative shall be present at the variance hearing to provide evidence and respond to such questions as may arise during the course of the hearing.

(e)   In considering an application for variance from the requirements of the Uniform Building Code, the board shall not grant such variance unless it shall, in each case, find affirmative support for each of the following standards in the evidence presented:

(1)   The variance requested arises from such conditions which are unique to the structure in question and which were not created by an illegal action of the owner, tenant or contractor.

(2)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights, property or safety of adjacent property owners or tenants nor will it adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare.

(3)   The strict application of the code in this case will constitute an unnecessary hardship upon the applicant.

(4)   The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the structure.

(5)   Granting the variance requested will not be opposed to the spirit and intent of the code.

(6)   The variance requested would be reasonably compatible with other uses permitted by the same occupancy classification.

(f)   The board shall notify the applicant of its determination in writing within 10 days following the conclusion of the hearing. The determination of the board shall be final.

In making such determination, the public officer may request that the building inspection staff of the municipality conduct a preliminary investigation as to such matters and submit a report thereon to the public officer. If the public officer makes a determination that such petition, together with the results of any such preliminary investigation, discloses a reasonable basis for such charges, the public officer shall then issue and cause to be served upon the owner, every mortgagee of record and all parties in interest in such structure (including persons in possession) a complaint stating the charges in that respect.

21-404.      Administrative procedure.

(a)   The city manager shall designate a public officer to be charged with the administration and enforcement of this article.

(3)   That the relocation of any specified vehicle to another location within the city that does not satisfy the specifications of sections 21-403(b) shall not serve to toll the running of any time limitations under this article, nor shall .such relocation constitute an abatement of the original motor vehicle nuisance condition specified in the notice, which violation shall be regarded a continuing notwithstanding such relocation.

(4)   That failure to either abate each such condition or to request a hearing within the time allowed may result in prosecution as provided by subsection (e) hereof and/or in the abatement of any such condition by the city as provided by subsection (f) hereof.

(e)   Should the person fail to comply with the notice to abate the nuisance or request a hearing the public officer may file a complaint in the municipal court of the city against such person.

(f)   In addition to, or as an alternative to prosecution as provided in subsection (e) hereof, the public officer may seek to remedy violations of this section in the following manner. If a person to whom a notice has been sent pursuant to subsection (b) hereof has neither alleviated the conditions causing the alleged violation nor requested a hearing before the governing body within the time period specified, the public officer may present a resolution to the governing body for adoption authorizing the public officer or other agents of the city to abate the conditions causing the violation at the end of 10 days after passage of the resolution.

(1)   By personal service upon the person in violation;

(2)   By service by restricted mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; or

(3)   In the event the whereabouts of such person are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, an affidavit to that effect shall be made by the public officer and filed with the city clerk, and the serving of the resolution shall be made by publishing the same once each week for two consecutive weeks in the official city newspaper and by posting a copy of the resolution on the premises where such condition exists.

(g)   Disposition of any motor vehicle removed or abated from private property pursuant to this section shall be as provided by K.S.A. 8-1102, as amended.

(h)   If a hearing is requested within the 10 day period as provided in subsection (d) hereof, such request shall be made in writing to the governing body. Failure to make a timely request for a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the person’s right to contest the findings of the public officer. If a hearing is timely requested, the hearing shall be held by the governing body as soon as possible after the filing of the request therefore, and the person shall be advised by the city of the time and place of the hearing at least five days in advance thereof. At any such hearing, the person may be represented by counsel, and the person and the city may introduce such witnesses and evidence as is deemed necessary and proper by the governing body. The hearing need not be conducted according to the formal rules of evidence. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the governing body shall record its determination of the matter by means of adopting a resolution and serving the resolution upon the person in the matter provided in subsection (f) hereof.

(i)    If the city abates the nuisance pursuant to subsection (f) hereof, the costs of abatement shall be charged against the lot or parcel of ground on which the nuisance was located. The city clerk shall, at the time of certifying other taxes to the county clerk, certify the costs as provided herein. The county clerk shall extend the same on the tax roll and it shall be collected by the county treasurer and paid to the city as other city taxes are collected and paid.

The notice shall also state, in prominent language, that failure by the owner to request a hearing within five days after receipt of the notice may act as a waiver of his or her right to a hearing and that this may result in the placing of a lien against the motor vehicle for the towing and storage charges without further notice to the owner; and that the motor vehicle be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after 15 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. The owner of the impounded motor vehicle shall sign the notice as an acknowledgment that he or she has received a copy of the notice and a copy of the notice shall be provided to the owner.

(b)   When Owner not Present. When the police department impounds and removes a motor vehicle pursuant to section 21-502(a) and the owner of the motor vehicle is not present at the time of the impoundment, the police department shall, if such motor vehicle has displayed thereon a registration plate issued by the division of vehicles and has been registered with said division, mail a notice by certified mail to the registered owner thereof, addressed to the address as shown on the certificate of registration, and to the lienholder, if any, of record in the county in which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in Kansas. The notice shall be in the form prescribed by the police department, containing the same information as required by section 21-504(a). The police department shall use reasonable diligence in determining the title owner, or if from a non-title state, the registered owner, of the vehicle, and shall inquire by mail of the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in this state, as to whether there are any lienholders of record. If the owner cannot be served by certified mail at the address on the motor vehicle registration and there is no other known address of the owner, the owner shall be deemed to be a resident of the state whose whereabouts are unknown and service shall be made on the Secretary of State as provided in K.S.A. 8-401.

If the owner does not reside in the state, as appears from the motor vehicle registration and the owner cannot be served by certified mail at the address on the motor vehicle registration and there is no other known address of the owner, the owner shall be deemed a nonresident of the state and service shall be made on the Secretary of State as provided in K.S.A. 8-401.

(c)   Failure or Refusal to Sign Notice. If any person required by this section to sign a notice of impoundment willfully fails or refuses to do so, or if such person cannot be found, the police department shall note this fact on the face of the notice, which shall constitute prima facie evidence of delivery or service of notice as required by this section.

(Code 1982; Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-505.      Impoundment after request to leave motor vehicle.

In all cases wherein the owner or operator of a motor vehicle which is on a public street has requested that the motor vehicle be left unattended at that location, in lieu of impoundment of the motor vehicle pursuant to section 15-402, the police department may honor such a request for a period of time not exceeding 24 hours, after which time the motor vehicle shall either be removed from the location by the owner or operator or be impounded by the police department pursuant to section 21-504. The police department shall be immune from liability for any damage, loss or destruction of the motor vehicle occasioned by its being left unattended pursuant to the request of the owner or operator thereof, in lieu of impoundment. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the police department to order the removal of a motor vehicle by its owner or operator or to impound a motor vehicle pursuant to section 21-504 at any time whenever in his judgment the presence of the unattended motor vehicle constitutes a danger to the public safety.

(Code 1982; Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-506.      Impoundment of Motor Vehicles from private property.

(a)   An Owner or Occupant of any real property, other than public property or property open to use by the public may request a wrecker or tow service to remove any Motor Vehicle which has been abandoned or parked on said property. The Motor Vehicle may be moved and disposed of in accordance with the terms of this article by a wrecker or towing service upon the request of the Owner or Occupant of such real property. The real property referred to herein shall not be owned or leased by the person who abandons or parks said vehicle or by the Owner or lessee of such vehicle. Any person, partnership, corporation or their agent conducting a business enterprise for the purpose of towing vehicles which removes such vehicle from the real property at the request of any Owner or Occupant shall have a possessory lien on such vehicle for the cost incurred in removing, towing and storing such vehicle. For purposes of this article, common areas shall be construed not to mean public property or property open to the public.

(b)   Maximum wrecker fees.

(1)   The maximum Motor Vehicle all- inclusive administrative tow including first 24 hours of storage shall be $250.00.

(2)   The maximum storage fee for Motor Vehicles stored after the first 24 hours shall be $30.00 per day.

(c)   The Owner of a Motor Vehicle towed pursuant to this Section shall have access to personal property in such vehicle for 48 hours after such Motor Vehicle has been towed and such personal property shall be released to the Owner.

(d)   The wrecker or towing service shall report the location of such vehicle to local law enforcement through Harvey County Communications within two hours of such tow.

(Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-507.      Release of motor vehicle from impoundment.

(a)   Generally. Unless the vehicle is impounded pursuant to section 21-502(b) herein, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment upon requesting such release and presenting proof of ownership satisfactory to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored. If the custodian is satisfied that the person making the request is the owner or the owner’s authorized agent, the custodian shall release the motor vehicle to the owner or the owner’s agent. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the owner of the impounded motor vehicle or the owner’s agent from paying any towing and storage charges that may be assessed against the motor vehicle, but neither the police department nor the custodian of the storage space may require payment of any towing or storage charges as a condition precedent to such release. At the same time as the owner or the owner’s agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle, and if such request is made with 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, the police department shall provide the owner or the owner’s agent an opportunity to make a request for a hearing on the propriety of the impoundment and on the amount of and liability for the towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; if the owner or owner’s agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle more than 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, no hearing may be requested on the impoundment or on the towing and storage charges and the owner shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the impoundment and to the amount of and liability for the towing and storage charges.

(b)   Security for Payment of Charges. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a title certificate issued by the Kansas Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the owner or owner’s agent may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment without the payment of any towing or storage charges or the deposit of any security for the payment thereof. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a foreign title instrument, or if the jurisdiction in which title is recorded is not evidence from the document establishing ownership, the owner or owner’s agent, before the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored authorizes release of the motor vehicle form impoundment, shall deposit with the custodian cash in the amount of the towing and storage charges to the date of the request. If the owner or owner’s agent refuses to provide the cash deposit, the custodian shall not authorize release of the impounded motor vehicle but if the request is timely made, a date shall be set for the hearing on the impoundment and charges.

(Code 1982; Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-508.      Hearing.

If the owner of an impounded motor vehicle or the owner’s agent timely requests the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment and a hearing on the impoundment and charges, as provided in section 21-506, a date shall be set, not more than five days after the date of request, for the hearing. The city attorney shall provide a hearing examiner to conduct the hearings required by this section. At the hearing, the owner, owner’s agent, or the owner’s attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to present, by oral testimony or documentary evidence, his or her objections to (a) the impoundment of the motor vehicle and (b)(1) the amount of the towing and storage charges and (2) his or her liability for the payment thereof. If the owner or owner’s agent requested the hearing more than five days but not more than 40 days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment, the owner, agent or attorney shall be required at the hearing, as a condition precedent to the presentation of any objections by the owner, to show good cause for the delay in making the request more than five days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment: if good cause cannot be shown, the hearing officer shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding stated in subsection (b) below; otherwise, the hearing examiner shall proceed to hear the owner’s objections. At the conclusion of the hearing on the owner’s objections, the hearing examiner shall render his or her decision. If the hearing examiner:

(a)   Finds that the impoundment was improper, he or she shall:

(1)   Find that the owner is not liable for any towing or storage charges occasioned by the impoundment, and

(2)   Determine whether, and to what extent, the city shall be liable for the expense of the towing and storage charges; or

(b)   Finds that the impoundment was proper, he or she shall establish:

(1)   The amount of the towing and storage charges to be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle, and

(2)   The extent of the liability of the owner for payment of the towing and storage charges so established. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, and a copy of the decision shall be furnished to the owner of the impounded motor vehicle, to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored and to the city attorney.

In the event that the impoundment was pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102(b), the owner or occupant of the real property upon which the abandoned vehicle was located shall not be assessed the costs of towing and storage of the vehicle. Further, nothing within this article shall be construed to modify or effect the validity of the possessory lien of the person removing such vehicle from the real property established by K.S.A. 8-1103(a).

(Code 1982; Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-509.      Charges constitute a lien.

The towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment of a motor vehicle pursuant to section 21-502 shall be and constitute a lien upon the impounded motor vehicle, except as provided in this section. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 21-507 that the impoundment was improper and determines that the city shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the lien created by this section shall be discharged. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 21-506 that the impoundment was proper but that the towing and storage charges should be in an amount less than the amount of the lien, the lien created by this section shall be discharged to the extent that it exceeds the amount established by the hearing examiner. The holder of a lien created by this section may perfect such lien in any manner provided by law, but may not retain possession of the motor vehicle when it has been released pursuant to section 21-506(a). In the event that the impounded motor vehicle is released from impoundment and the owner or owner’s agent has provided security for payment of charges as required by section 21-506(b), the lien created by this section shall also be a lien against the security so provided, subject to being wholly or partially discharged as provided in this section.

(Code 1982; Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-510.      Satisfaction of lien; notice of public sale.

The holder of a lien against a motor vehicle created by section 21-508, to the extent that such lien has not been discharged as provided in section 21-508 or otherwise satisfied, may enforce such lien in any manner provided by law after 30 days from the date the motor vehicle is impounded by the police department. If the owner of the motor vehicle or owner’s agent has provided security for the payment of the lien as provided in section 21-506(b), the lien shall first be satisfied out of the security so provided and, if any portion of the lien remains unsatisfied and undischarged, may then be enforced in any manner provided by law. If the motor vehicle against which the lien is created pursuant to section 21-508 is still under impoundment 30 days from the date it is impounded by the police department and the owner has not requested release of the motor vehicle from impoundment nor paid the towing and storage charges that are the basis for the lien, the motor vehicle shall be sold at public sale to the highest and best bidder for cash to satisfy the lien. Notice of the sale shall be given in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1104. Publication, required by K.S.A. 8-1104, may be made before the termination of the 60 day period for a sale thereafter.

(Code 1982; Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-511.      Redemption.

If the city is to conduct the sale:

(a)   Any holder of a recorded lien or retained title on a motor vehicle to be sold by the city under the provisions of section 21-509 may claim and take possession thereof, upon payment of accrued charges and estimated costs of publication of the notice of sale to the police department and the deposit with the police department of sufficient assurance by surety bond or otherwise, approved by the city attorney, that the motor vehicle will be forthcoming for public sale thereof or upon claim of the rightful owner prior to the sale. The police department shall, within three days, make a report to the city treasurer and deliver the charges and costs so paid to the city treasurer, taking a receipt therefor and filing it, together with a duplicate copy of the report to the city treasurer, with the records in his or her office. The funds shall be held in a trust account until final disposition of the motor vehicle. Not less than five days before the date for sale of the motor vehicle, the police department shall notify the lienholder or retained titleholder of the time and place for the sale, and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall deliver such motor vehicle to the police department at or before 12:00 noon of the day before the sale. At the sale the amount paid shall be credited on the bid of the lienholder or retained titleholder. If the lienholder or retained titleholder is the successful bidder for the motor vehicle, the police department shall report this fact to the city treasurer and then the funds previously paid by the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be relieved of the trust previously impressed and become the same as other funds received by the city for storage and costs of impounded motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is sold for a higher bid to any person other than the lienholder or retained titleholder, the police department shall report this fact to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him or her out of the trust account.

(b)   If the rightful owner of the motor vehicle claims the same before the sale by payment of the accrued charges, the police department shall immediately notify the lienholder or retained titleholder in possession of the motor vehicle and he or she shall return the same to the police department within 12 hours. The police department shall report this redemption by the rightful owner to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him or her out of the trust account.

(Code 1982; 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-512.      Sale proceeds.

The proceeds of a public sale held pursuant to section 21-508, whether such sale was conducted by the city or by any other person, after payment of the towing and storage charges and costs and expenses incident to the sale, shall be deposited with the city treasurer, if the owner of the motor vehicle is absent from the sale, for credit to the trust account. The funds deposited in the trust account pursuant to this section shall remain in the account subject to the order of the person legally entitled thereto, but if no claim is made for these funds within a period of one year after the sale, the funds shall become the property of the city, be released from the trust account and be paid into the general fund as miscellaneous revenues.

(Code 1982; Code 2020; Ord. 5025-20)

21-513.      Statutory procedures.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to augment, diminish, supersede or otherwise interfere with any statutory procedure established by the legislature for the collection of unpaid towing and storage charges. The procedures in this article are supplementary and cumulative to any statutory procedures.

If a lien created by section 21-508 and held by a private wrecker or towing firm is discharged by section 21-508 pursuant to a determination by a hearing examiner that an impoundment was improper and that the city shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the city shall pay to the firm the amount determined by the hearing examiner.

(Ord. 4004, Sec. 3)

22-204.      Excess use charges.

(a)   Residential, Commercial and Industrial Customers: A summer weather consumption allotment is hereby established for each residential, commercial and industrial customer of the city. The summer water consumption allotment for each billing period for each of the months of May through October, inclusive, for each such customer shall be equal to 1.5 times such customer’s average monthly winter water consumption, or 1,500 cubic feet per month, whichever volume is greater. The average monthly winter water consumption shall be equal to the average consumption in the preceding December, January, February and March for each such customer. An excess use charge for any volume of water used over the summer water consumption allotment, equal to 0.5 times the metered water service charge for that same volume is hereby assessed and shall be added to the bills rendered in June, July, August, September, October and November, except as otherwise superceded by present contracts; provided, however, that any further contracts for the sale of water shall provide for a water conservation plan which shall be evaluated by the Citizens Water Conservation Committee with recommendations submitted to the governing body.

(b)   Golf Courses and Public Recreational Facilities: A summer water consumption allotment is hereby established for each golf course and qualified public recreational facility served by the city. The summer water consumption allotment for each billing period for the months of July through October, inclusive, for each golf course and public recreational facility, shall be equal to 1.5 times such customer’s average monthly consumption in the months of May and June, as determined by meter readings taken in May and June, provided that the summer allotment for each golf course and public recreational facility shall be not less than 125,000 cubic feet per month. A public recreational facility shall be deemed to be qualified for this allotment if, upon application made by the owner or operator thereof, the city clerk determines that such facility is regularly available for public use (including use by or through a governmental entity) as a preponderant portion of its total use, and if its maintenance for such use requires irrigation. The city clerk may, in his or her discretion, require a separate meter for water used for such purposes, and in that event the allotment shall apply only to that separately metered water usage.

(c)   Water Conservation Special Use Fund: All moneys generated by the excess use charges shall be held in a water conservation special use fund and utilized for the promotion of water conservation for the education of the public as to water conservation and for the development of new water supplies.

(d)   Adjustment and Abeyance Requests: Any commercial, industrial or residential customer may request that the city clerk adjust a billing for consumption over a summer allotment if the increased summer water consumption results from a change in business activity or plant output or does not directly or indirectly result from water used for irrigation or cooling. Any commercial or industrial customer who operates a building which uses water for cooling purposes may request that an excess use charge be held in abeyance. An abeyance may be granted if the customer produces a plan of conservation for the reduction of water use which meets approval of the water department. The charge may be reduced or cancelled if the customer’s plans are carried out and consumption of water is substantially reduced. Requests shall receive consideration on an individual basis. Any aggrieved party may appeal to the Citizens Water Conservation Committee. The Citizens Water Conservation Committee shall conduct a public hearing on any such appeal within 30 days of the filing of such appeal with the city clerk. The city clerk shall cause a notice of such public hearing to be published not less than 10 days in advance of such hearing. After the hearing has been commenced, the hearing may be continued without the necessity of further notice. Upon the conclusion of such hearing, the decision of such committee, by the vote of a majority of those in attendance, shall be final and binding. Such decision shall be recorded in writing and filed with the city clerk.

ARTICLE 3. CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL

22-301.      Purpose, authority and responsibility.

The purpose of the article is:

(a)   To protect the public potable water supply served by the Newton water department from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating, within its customers’ internal distribution system, such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or back-siphon into the public water system;

(b)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between its customers’ in-plant potable water system, and non-potable systems; and

(c)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems by cross-connection. Authority is provided by the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and the Kansas Administrative Regulation 28-15-18. The city water department, as the water purveyor, has the primary responsibility for preventing cross-connections with the public potable water system. The director of water and sewer shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow back-siphonage of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the director, an approved backflow device is required at the city’s water service connection to any customer’s premises, the director, or the delegated agent of the director, shall give notice in writing to the customer to install an approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to the customer’s premises. The customer shall, within 90 days, install such approved device, or devices, at the customer’s own expense, and failure or refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install the device or devices within 90 days, shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices have been properly installed.

If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards.  Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.

(h)   Measurement.  For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and separation distances shall be calculated and applied irrespective of whether comparative properties, sites or structures are located within or outside of the City jurisdictional boundaries.

(i)    Non-Essential Services.  Towers and antennas shall be regulated and permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be regulated or permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.

(j)    Franchises.  Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or operation of a wireless communication system within the City have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Zoning Administrator.

(o)   Nonconforming Uses.

(1)   Non-Expansion of Nonconforming Use.  Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.

(2)   Pre-existing towers.  Pre-existing towers shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist.  Routine maintenance (including replacement with a new tower of like construction and height) shall be permitted on such pre-existing towers.

(1)   No fee shall be required as a permitted use under Section 23-405 beyond what payment or other compensation is set forth in the applicable agreement.

(2)   As to an application for an administratively approved use under Section 23-406:

(i)    $100 if the application is for approval of the location of an antenna on an existing structure or tower which does not entail any significant modification to or reconstruction of the structure or tower to accommodate the antenna;

(ii)   $500 for any other administratively approved application.

(3)   $1,000 for an application for a special use permit under Section 23-407.  If an application has first been submitted for an administratively approved use, and then is re-submitted as an application for a special use permit following a denial of the former, a separate application fee for the special use permit shall still be applicable.

(4)   $500 for an application for a variance from any of the restrictions or requirements of this article.

(r)    Multiple Applications.  There shall be no restriction against submitting a request both in the form of an application for an administratively approved use and in the form of an application for a special use permit; provided, however, that the prescribed application fee for each shall be paid.

(s)   Variances.  If in relation to an application for a special use permit the applicant also seeks a variance from any requirement as to which the Planning Commission is not specifically herein given discretion, an application for such a variance may be submitted along with the application for a special use permit.  If heard at the same time as the special use permit application, and if the notice given on the special use permit specifically discloses that a variance request is also included, identifying the nature of the variance being sought, then a separate notice need not be given as to the variance application.  However, the standards for the granting of any such variance as set forth in Section 13.3-4 of the Zoning Ordinances shall still be applicable.

However, as to a denial which is based upon the Zoning Administrator’s interpretation of the applicable rules and regulations, or the manner in which those rules and regulations apply to the applicant’s project, the applicant shall have the option to appeal that decision pursuant to Section 13.1-7 of the Zoning Ordinances.  The taking of any such appeal shall not serve to prevent any contemporaneous or subsequent application for a special use permit.  A denial which is based upon the exercise by the Zoning Administrator of judgment or discretion specifically given to the Zoning Administrator herein shall not be so appealable, and the applicant’s recourse in relation to such matters shall be through an application for a special use permit.

(b)   List of Administratively Approved Uses.  The following uses may be approved by the Zoning Administrator after conducting an administrative review:

(1)   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna, in any industrial or C-2 (General Business District) zoning district. 

(2)   Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with the terms of subsections (i) and (ii) below.

(i)    Antennas on existing structures.  Any antenna which is not attached to a tower may be approved by the Zoning Administrator as an accessory use to any commercial, industrial, professional, institutional, or multi-family structure of eight or more dwelling units, provided:

(A)  The antenna does not extend more than thirty (30) feet above the highest point of the structure;

(B)  The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA regulations; and

(C)  The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.

(ii)   Antennas on existing towers.  An antenna which is attached to an existing tower may be approved by the Zoning Administrator and, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:

(A)  A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower, unless the Zoning Administrator allows reconstruction as a monopole.

(B)  Height

a.     An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed thirty (30) feet over the tower’s existing height, to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna.

b.    The height change referred to in subsection a. above may only occur one time per communication tower.

c.     The additional height referred to in subsection a. above shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in Section 23-407.  The tower’s premodification height shall be used to calculate such distance separations.

(C)  Onsite tower location

a.     A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna may be moved onsite within fifty (50) feet of its existing location.

b.    After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one tower may remain on the site.

c.     A relocated onsite tower shall continue to be measured from the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances between towers pursuant to Section 23-407(b)(5).  The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way be deemed to cause a violation of Section 23-407(b)(5).

d.    The onsite relocation of a tower which comes within the separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as established in Section 23-407(b)(5) shall only be permitted when approved by the Zoning Administrator.

(3)   New towers in non-residential zoning districts.  Locating any new tower in a non-residential zoning district other than an industrial or C-2 (General Business District) zoning district, provided a licensed professional engineer certifies the tower can structurally accommodate the number of shared users proposed by the applicant;  the Zoning Administrator concludes the tower is in conformity with the goals set forth in Section 23-401 and the requirements of Section 23-404;  the tower meets the setback requirements in Section 23-407(b)(4) and separation distances in Section 23-407(b)(5); and the tower meets the following height and usage criteria:

WHEREAS, Article 12, Section 5 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas (the “Act”), provides that cities may exercise certain home rule powers, including passing charter ordinances which exempt such cities from the acts of the Kansas Legislature; and

WHEREAS, the City of Newton, Kansas (the “City”) is a City, as defined in the Act, duly created and organized, under the laws of the State of Kansas; and

WHEREAS, K.S.A. 13-1017 is part of an enactment of the Kansas Legislature (K.S.A. 13 1017, et seq.) relating to general improvements and the issuance of bonds for such purposes, which enactment is applicable to the City, but is not uniformly applicable to all cities within the State of Kansas; and

WHEREAS, the governing body of the City has heretofore passed Charter Ordinance No. 6 which exempts the City from the provisions of K.S.A. 13-1017, and provides substitute and additional provisions therefor; and

WHEREAS, the governing body of the City desires, by charter ordinance, to amend Section 2 of Charter Ordinance No. 6;

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE CITY OF NEWTON, KANSAS:

SECTION 1.  Amendment.  The City, by the power vested in it by the Act, hereby elects to amend Section 2 of Charter Ordinance No. 6, which said Section 2 provided substitute and additional provisions in the place of the provisions of K.S.A. 13-1017, from which the City was exempted by virtue of the provisions of Section 1 of Charter Ordinance No. 6, with said Section 2 thereof being hereby amended to read as follows:

Section 2.  Except as otherwise provided below, before the construction or re-construction of any sidewalk, curb, gutter, bridge, pavement, sewer or any other public improvement in any street, highway or public grounds, or of any public building or facility, or any other kind of public improvement which is to be financed by the issuance of bonds shall be commenced or ordered by the governing body, or under its authority, a detailed estimate of the cost of such improvements shall be made by the City Engineer (or some other competent person appointed for such purpose by the governing body) and submitted to the governing body for its approval.  The governing body shall determine whether the work can best be accomplished by city forces or by contract.  If the work is to be done by other than city forces, invitation for sealed proposals for the building, public improvement or construction thereof shall be mailed by the City Clerk to at least three (3) responsible bidders.  When received, the sealed proposals shall be publicly opened and read and the governing body shall let all such work by contract to the lowest responsible bidder if there be any such whose bid does not exceed the estimate.  The provisions herein shall not apply under the following circumstances:

(a)   Improvements which are constructed on or to real estate owned in whole or in part by the City and leased to a tenant industry may be made by the tenant industry under the provisions of a lease agreement between the City and such tenant industry.  In such situations, the tenant industry may contract for such improvements, provided that such is done in full conformance with the provisions of the lease agreement, and with all applicable city codes and regulations, and provided, further, that before the commencement of any such construction work the tenant industry shall provide instrument(s) of surety or a letter of credit in an amount to be approved by the City guaranteeing the full and faithful completion of construction of such improvements, and provided, further, that no funds derived from tax levies shall be employed in such construction.

(b)   Public improvements which are to be constructed on or to real estate owned in whole or in part by the City, and which are part of an overall development project with one or more private developers, may be constructed pursuant to the terms of a development agreement between the City and such developer(s), provided that such is done in full conformance with the provisions of the development agreement, and with all applicable city codes and regulations.  If such public improvements are to be constructed by any such developer(s), then before commencement of any such construction work the developer(s) shall provide instrument(s) of surety or a letter of credit or other acceptable security in an amount to be approved by the City guaranteeing the full and faithful completion of construction of such improvements.  The provisions of this subsection may be utilized only if the governing body of the City has, prior to the commencement of the construction of such public improvements, conducted a public hearing to consider whether to implement the provisions of this subsection and adopted a resolution approving the same which resolution shall be approved by at least a two-thirds majority of the members of the governing body.  Notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the official city newspaper at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing.

(c)   Public improvements may be constructed pursuant to a design-build contract which sets forth a lump-sum, fixed price for work to be provided. Design-build projects shall be awarded on the basis of the consideration of the following factors: (i) the lowest lump-sum, fixed price; (ii) design concepts; (iii) the experience of company or consortium of companies submitting proposals; and (iv) other pertinent criteria that shall be set by the governing body prior to the acceptance of proposals. Contracts for design-build projects do not have to be awarded solely upon the basis of lowest lump-sum, fixed price submitted. However, contracts shall be awarded to the lowest lump-sum, fixed price if each of the other criteria is equal or nearly equal. The governing body shall reserve the right to reject all proposals submitted.

SECTION 2. Severability.  Any provision or section of this Charter Ordinance is deemed or rule unconstitutional or otherwise illegal or invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Charter Ordinance.  In such instance, this Charter Ordinance shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had not been contained herein.

SECTION 3.         Repealer.  Section 2 of Charter Ordinance No. 6 of the City is hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Charter Ordinance.

hearing on the proposed amendment, twenty (20) days notice of the time and

part of the land described a zoning classification or lesser change than that set
forth in the notice. The Planning Commission may give such additional notice to
other persons as it may from time to time provide by its rules.
C. Conduct of Hearing: The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the
proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner and according to such
procedures as the Planning Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule.
Any interested person or party may appear and be heard at the hearing in person
by agent or by attorney. The Planning Commission may request a report on any
proposed amendment from any governmental official or agency, or any other
person, firm, or corporation. If such a report is made, a copy thereof shall be
made available to the applicant and any other interested person in the offices of
the Planning Commission.
D. Findings of Fact and Recommendation of the Planning Commission:
Within sixty (60) days after the close of a public hearing on a proposed
amendment, the Planning Commission shall submit a report to the City Governing
Body. A copy of the report shall be filed with the City Clerk and with the office of
the City Planner and such copies shall be kept available for public
inspection. A vote either for or against an amendment by a majority of all of the
Planning Commissioners present constitutes a recommendation of the Planning
Commission; whereas a vote either for or against an amendment by less than a
majority of all of the Planning Commissioners present constitutes a "failure to
recommend." Such report shall contain findings based upon the evidence
presented and a recommendation as to whether the proposed amendment should
be adopted. The report submitted to the City Governing Body shall be
accompanied by a copy of the record of the hearing on the proposed
amendment.
1. Amendments to Text: When a proposed amendment would result in a
change in the text of these Regulations, but would not result in a change of
zoning classification of any specific property, the report of the Planning
Commission shall contain a statement as to the effect of such proposed
amendment and findings as to the following:
(a) Whether such change is consistent with the interest and purpose of
these Regulations.
(b) The areas which are most likely to be directly affected by such
change and in what way they will be affected.
(c) Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of
changed or changing conditions in the areas and zoning districts
affected, and, if so, the nature of such changes or changing
conditions.
2. Amendments to Change Zoning Districts: When a proposed amendment
would result in a change of the zoning classification of any specific
property, the report of the Planning Commission shall contain statements
as to the present classification, the classification under the proposed
amendment, the character of the neighborhood, the zoning and land uses of
the properties nearby and findings to the following:
(a) Whether the change in classification would be consistent with the
intent and purpose of these Regulations, with the City's adopted
Comprehensive Plan and other adopted City policies, programs,
ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(b) Whether every use that would be permitted on the property if it were
reclassified would be compatible with the uses permitted on other
property in the immediate vicinity; and whether the subject property
is suitable for the uses to which it has been restricted.
(c) Whether adequate sewer and water facilities, and all other needed
public services, exist or can be provided to serve the uses that
would be permitted on the property if it were reclassified.
(d) Whether the proposed amendment would correct an error in the
application of these Regulations.
(e) Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of
changed or changing conditions in the area affected, and, if so, the
nature of such changed or changing conditions; and whether the
proposed amendment provides a disproportionately great loss to the
individual land owners relative to the public gain.
E. Action by the Governing Body:
1. Receipt of Planning Commission Report and Recommendation: The
Governing Body shall act only after the Planning Commission has submitted
either a recommendation of approval or disapproval, or a "failure to
recommend."
2. Consideration of the Planning Commission Recommendation: The
Governing Body shall consider the Planning Commission's recommendation
at the next regularly scheduled Governing Body meeting for which the
agenda item can be docketed, except that no recommendation on a zoning
district amendment shall be considered by the Governing Body until fifteen
(15) days after the close of the Planning Commission public hearing on
such amendment.
3. Action by Governing Body: The Governing Body shall:
(a) Approve the recommendation of the Planning Commission and
adopt such recommendation by ordinance; or
(b) Take no further action thereon; or
(c) Disapprove the Planning Commission's recommendation and
return such recommendation to the Planning Commission with a
written statement specifying the basis for disapproval, and such
recommendation shall be reconsidered by the Planning Commission
at its next regularly scheduled meeting; or
(d) Take such action as it deems appropriate in the event the
Planning Commission submits a "failure to recommend" to
the Governing Body as set forth in Section 1.10-4.D of
these Regulations.
4. Reconsideration by Planning Commission: Within ten (10) days after
receipt at a Planning Commission meeting of the Governing Body's
statement specifying disapproval, the Planning Commission shall reconsider
such recommendation and resubmit its original recommendation giving the
reasons therefore, or submit new and amended recommendations.
5. Reconsideration by the Governing Body: The Governing Body, upon
receipt of such recommendation, may adopt or may revise or amend and
adopt such recommendation by ordinance, or it need take no action
thereon. If the Planning Commission fails to deliver its recommendations to
the Governing Body within ten (10) days after receipt of the Governing
Body's statement specifying disapproval, the governing body shall consider
such course of inaction on the part of the Planning
Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and
proceed accordingly.
6. Inaction by Governing Body: If a proposed amendment is considered by
the Governing Body but not acted upon finally within 120 days of the date
upon which the Planning Commission report and recommendation was
considered, such proposed amendment shall be deemed to have been
denied, unless the applicant for such amendment shall have consented
to an extension of such period in time.
7. Protest: If a protest against the proposed amendment is filed in the office
of the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days after the date of the conclusion
of the Planning Commission public hearing pursuant to said publication
notice, duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the
owners of twenty percent (20%) of the total area, excepting public street
and ways, located within or without the corporate limits of the City and
located within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the property
proposed to be rezoned, then such amendment shall not be passed except
by at least 3/4 vote of all the members of the Governing Body.
1.11. Scope of Controls:
1.11-1. Existing Permits: This Ordinance is not intended to abrogate or annul any
building permit, certificate of occupancy, variance or special permit lawfully
issued before the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
A. If the applicable regulations of this ordinance or any amendments to the ordinance
after issuance of a building permit, granting of a variance or issuance of a special
permit make the proposed use under such building permit, variance or special
permit nonconforming as to the Use and Bulk Regulations, and no substantial
construction or substantial operations for nonbuilding uses have been undertaken
on the structure or foundation, or conducted for the nonbuilding uses, within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date
of the adoption of this ordinance and any amendments thereto, the building permit,
special permit, or variance shall be invalid. If substantial construction or
substantial operations have taken place and are continuing at the time, the
proposed use may be completed.
B. Nothing herein shall prevent any holder of a variance from applying to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for a variance, where appropriate under the currently existing law
and facts.

ARTICLE IV
SPECIAL USE PERMITS
4.1. General Considerations:
4.1-1. Delegation of Power: The Governing Body is hereby authorized to decide
whether special use permits shall be granted subject to the general and specific
standards contained in the Ordinance; to grant special use permits with such
conditions or restrictions as are appropriate to protect the public interest and to
secure compliance with this Ordinance; and to deny requests which fail to satisfy
the standards and requirements contained herein and which are not in harmony
with the
purposes and interest of this Ordinance and the health, safety, and welfare of the
community. The Governing Body shall decide whether special use permits shall
be granted only after having received a recommendation from the Joint Board of
Zoning Appeals. In no event shall a special use permit be granted where the
proposed
use is not authorized by the terms of this Ordinance, or where the standards listed
in 4.3. of this Article are not found to exist.
4.1-2. Variances: The Joint Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant any variance of the
applicable provisions of these regulations after such special use permit has been
granted by the Governing Body; provided, however, that after the granting of a
special use permit, the Board may grant a bulk variance for other than minimum
lot area only if the Planning Commission, upon review of the proposed site plan,
recommends such variance as desirable to promote proper use of the site.
4.1-3. Conditions and Guarantees: Prior to the granting of any special use permit the
Planning Commission or Governing Body may stipulate such conditions and
restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and
operation of the special permit use as is deemed necessary for the protection of
the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and conditions
herein. In all cases in which a special use permit is granted, the Planning
Commission may
recommend or Governing Body may require such evidence and guarantees as
may be deemed necessary to insure that the conditions stipulated are being and
will be fully complied with.
4.2. Procedures:
4.2-1. Application: A written application for a special use permit shall be filed with the
City Planner and shall include a statement indicating the section of the Ordinance
under which the permit is sought, the grounds upon which it is requested, and
sufficient evidence to show that the use will conform to the standards set forth in
Section 4.3. The application shall be accompanied by an area map and a site
plan of the subject property.
4.2-2. Fees: Every application for a special use permit shall be subject to a filing fee of
fifty ($50.00) dollars.
4.2-3. Site Plan: All applicants for a special use permit shall submit with their application
ten (10) copies of a development plan for the property which shall include the
following:
A. A site plan showing:
1. Approximate size and locations of all buildings.
2. Access from streets.
3. Parking arrangements and number of spaces.
4. Interior drives and service areas.
5. Landscaped areas.
6. All proposed signs.
B. Location map showing development and zoning of adjacent property within
one hundred (100) feet.
C. The full legal description of the boundaries of said development area.
D. A description of the general character of all buildings.
4.2-4. Hearing: Upon receipt of the formal application and all accompanying
material, the City Planner shall call a public hearing for the next scheduled meeting
of the Joint Board of Zoning Appeals, provided, however, that notice must be
published in a newspaper of general circulation at least five (5) days prior to the
date set for hearing. The Planning Commission shall submit a recommendation to
the Governing Body within thirty (30) days after the close of the public hearing.
4.2-5. Findings: In making a recommendation to the Governing Body, the Planning
Commission shall specify the particular grounds relied upon and their relation to
the proposed use and shall make affirmative findings that the proposed use
conforms with the general standards set forth in Section 4.3. In no case shall an
exception be granted if the proposed use will constitute a nuisance or a public
health or safety hazard to adjacent properties or to the community at large.
4.2-6. Action by Governing Body: The Governing Body shall consider the Planning
Commission's recommendation at the next regularly scheduled Governing Body
meeting for which the agenda item can be docketed. The Governing Body may
adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by resolution. If
the Governing Body fails to act upon a recommendation within 120 days from the
receipt thereof, the application shall be deemed to have been denied.
4.2-7. Period of Validity of Special Use Permit: A special use permit shall expire
automatically, without revocation by the City, unless a building permit to effectuate
such specially permitted use is obtained within twelve (12) months after such
permit is obtained by the applicant, or if no building permit is required, unless
substantial evidence of use is filed with the Zoning Administrator within the twelve
(12) months period after such permit is obtained. A special use permit shall
expire if the specially permitted use shall cease or be abandoned for more than
twelve (12) months.
4.3. Standards for Issuance of Special Use Permits:
4.3-1. Generally: Before any permit shall be granted the Planning Commission shall
make written findings certifying that adequate provision has been made for the
following:
A. The location and size of the proposed use in relation to the site and to adjacent
sites and uses of property; and the nature and intensity of operations proposed
thereon.
B. Accessibility of the property to police, fire, refuse collection and other municipal
services; adequacy of ingress and egress to and within the site; traffic flow and
control; and the adequacy of off-street parking and loading areas.
C. Utilities and services, including water, sewer, drainage, gas, and electricity, with
particular reference to location, availability, capacity and compatibility.
D. The location, nature, and height of buildings, walls, fences, and other
improvements; their relation to adjacent property and uses; and the need for
buffering or screening.
E. The adequacy of required yard and open space requirements and sign provisions.
F. The general compatibility with adjacent properties, other properties in the district,
and the general safety, health, comfort and general welfare of the community.
G. The standards and requirements as prescribed in Section 4.5 of this Article.
4.4. Uses Permitted by Special Use Permit:
4.4-1. See Table of General Use Regulations - Section 3.2 of this Ordinance.
4.5. Provisions for Particular Classes of Special Use Permit Uses:
4.5-1. Accessory Apartment in R-S and R-1 Districts: Before a permit shall be granted
to allow the incorporation of an accessory apartment into an existing single family
dwelling, the Planning Commission shall make written findings certifying that the
following provisions have been met:
A. The structure into which the accessory apartment is to be incorporated shall be
occupied by the current owner/applicant.
B. The accessory apartment shall be incorporated within an existing structure such
that a separate housekeeping unit is created which is attached to the existing unit
by a common wall, floor or ceiling and not just a breezeway or porch; and such
that the exterior single-family appearance of the structure, as viewed from the
public right of way, is not altered.
C. The accessory apartment unit shall be clearly subordinate to the existing unit and
shall occupy no more than 45 percent of the entire floor area of the structure.
D. The application shall comply with all requirements of Article IV, Special Use
Permits, and all requirements of this Ordinance which regulate uses in singlefamily
residential districts.
4.5-2. Agricultural Uses in Flood Plain (FP) Zoning District:
4.5-2.1. Permitted Uses: The following uses having a low flood damage potential
shall be permitted in an FP District (to the extent that they are not
prohibited by any other ordinance) upon application to the Planning
Commission and approval by the Governing Body of a Special Use Permit:
Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant
nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming and
wild crop harvesting.
4.5-2.2. Permitted Accessory Uses and Structures: The following accessory uses
and structures shall be permitted subject to Section 3.2-1. of this
Ordinance:
A. A structure for storage of agricultural tools and implements required to perform
the approved agricultural use at the site, provided that the structure shall not
exceed 1600 square feet in gross floor area, and provided that the agricultural use
shall exceed 40,000 square feet in minimum area.
B. A temporary structure for sale of produce grown at the site, provided that such a
structure shall be allowed only for a time period to be established by the special
use permit.
C. The gathering by the general public of unharvested produce at the site, provided
that the allowed time for such accessory use shall be established by the special
use permit.
D. Exterior storage of agricultural tools and implements required to perform the
agricultural use at the site, except that where such use is in or adjacent to a
residential district, a solid fence, wall or obscuring plant material not less than six
(6) feet in height shall screen the exterior accessory storage from the view of all
adjacent public and private property.
4.5-2.3. Standards: Before any special use permit shall be granted for a permitted
agricultural use in the FP district, the Planning Commission shall make
written findings certifying that the requirements of Article IV, Special Use
Permits, and Article XIV, Flood Plain Zoning District, have been met.
4.5-3. Bed-and-Breakfast Facilities:
4.5-3.1. Bed-and-Breakfast Facilities are hereby deemed to be compatible and
appropriate property uses in R-S (Single-family Suburban Districts), R-1
(Single-family Dwelling Districts) and R-2 (Two-family Dwelling Districts),
provided that such uses are made subject to reasonable limitations and
conditions necessary to protect and preserve the residential character and
use of properties that are now or may hereafter become located within the
District.
4.5-3.2. A special use permit may be granted for a property located in an R-S
(Single-family Suburban District), R-1 (Single-family Dwelling District) zoning
district for the purpose of the operation of a Bed-and-Breakfast Facility if the
following requirements and criteria are satisfied:
A. All requirements and procedures applicable to special use permits in general
under the Zoning Ordinances shall also be applicable to special use permits for
the operation of Bed-and-Breakfast Facilities.
B. In addition to the requirements under the Zoning Ordinances for the submission of
a site plan or development plan for the property, such site plan or development
plan shall also include a floor plan illustrating the existing layout of all rooms and
space within the residential structure, and any proposed alterations thereto,
including an identification of the existing and proposed uses of each such room or
space therein.
C. Subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (d) below, the permit shall specify
the maximum number of sleeping units which the facility is permitted to maintain
and make available to the general public for overnight guests of the Bed-and-
Breakfast Facility, and the maximum number of bedrooms/sleeping units that can
be maintained within the structure for any purpose, which determinations shall be
based upon the following factors:
(1) The size of the structure and the number of rooms in the structure which
can reasonably be used as sleeping rooms and restroom facilities for
overnight guests without impairing the character of the dwelling as a singlefamily
structure and without overcrowding, taking into consideration the
number of regular, residential occupants of the structure; and
(2) The extent of the parking accommodations that can be made available to
overnight guests, taking into consideration the normal parking needs of the
regular, residential occupants of the structure and of the neighborhood.
D. Unless special circumstances or unique characteristics of the property are
specifically found to exist, no Bed-and-Breakfast Facility may be permitted for
more than four sleeping units that may be provided or used for public
accommodation. The number of overnight guests housed in the facility at any
given time (not including the number of regular, residential occupants of the
structure), may not exceed the number of permitted sleeping units multiplied by
three.
E. The special use permit shall designate the minimum number of off-street parking
spaces which must be provided and the maximum number of off-street parking
spaces which may be provided. In setting such limitations, consideration shall be
given to the following:
(1) The extent to which reliance upon on-street parking may cause congestion
or inconvenience to the neighborhood; and
(2) The extent to which off-street parking accommodations may detract from
or impair the residential character of the neighborhood.
4.5-3.3. On-site meal service at any Bed-and-Breakfast Facility that is provided for
compensation of any kind shall be limited to meal service to the overnight
guests of the Facility and to occasional special events. No on-site meal
service may be provided to the general public on any ongoing, regular or
regularly scheduled basis.
4.5-3.4. No Bed-and-Breakfast Facility shall operate in the nature of a rooming
house, lodging house or apartment whereby sleeping units are provided for
on-going occupancy by any person or persons for compensation of any
kind. It shall not be a violation of this provision for a Bed-and-Breakfast
Facility to have an occasional guest who stays for an extended period not
in excess of sixty days. However, no more than one sleeping unit at a Bedand-
Breakfast Facility may be in occupancy at any given time by a person
or persons staying in excess of one week, and the overall, predominant
character of the guest-stays shall be in the nature of short-term stays of
three nights or less.
4.5-3.5. Every Bed-and-Breakfast Facility operating under a special use permit is
required to maintain a log recording the name and address of each
overnight guest, the date(s) each such guest was lodged at the Facility,
and an identification of the unit occupied by each such guest within the
Facility. Every such Bed-and-Breakfast Facility must also maintain a log
recording the dates and other identifying information regarding any on-site
meal service provided at the Facility to persons other than overnight
guests, including the nature of the occasion or event giving rise to such
meal service, the names and addresses of the hosts or sponsors thereof,
and the total number of guests so served. All such logs shall be maintained
on-site at all times and shall be available for inspection at any time upon
request by any officer or agent of the City authorized to enforce the

ARTICLE V
"PUD" PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
5.1. Statutory Authorization: The provisions relating to planned unit development
districts are adopted pursuant to the authorization contained in Kansas Statutes
Annotated Sections 12-733. The City Governing Body may by Ordinance approve
the establishment of a planned unit development district on any parcel or tract of
land which is suitable for and of sufficient size to be developed as a planned unit
development consistent with the intent and purpose of this Ordinance and the
Comprehensive Plan.
5.2. Purpose: The intent of this Article is to permit greater flexibility and,
consequently, more creative and imaginative design for developments than
generally is possible under conventional zoning regulations by establishing planned
unit development districts which are in general harmony with the purpose and
intent of the Zoning Ordinance and with the Comprehensive Plan of the City, but in
which permitted uses, densities, open space requirements and other elements
may vary from those applicable in any other districts established in this Ordinance.
Therefore, it is the purpose of this Article to:
5.2-1. Promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification in the location of
structures.
5.2-2. Promote the efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic arrangement of
buildings, circulation systems, land use and utilities.
5.2-3. Conserve the value of land by relating the type, design and layout of development
to the particular site and its natural features.
5.2-4. Provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities and common
open space than would otherwise be provided under conventional land
development procedures.
5.2-5. Provide the maximum choice in the types of environment and living units available
to the public.
5.3. Definitions: The following definitions shall apply and be used whenever these
terms appear in this Article:
A. Homeowners' Association: A non-profit organization of homeowners in which each
lot owner in the planned unit development is a member and in which each lot is
subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses of the organization's
activities, such as maintaining required open space.
B. Planned Unit Development: An area to be developed as a single entity according
to an approved plan, containing residential uses and associated nonresidential
uses as specified in this Article.
C. Screening: A strip at least 10 feet wide of densely planted trees or shrubs at
least eight feet high at the time of planting of a type that will form a year-round
screen; or any other artificial or natural divider as may be required and approved
by the Planning Commission in the Final Development Plan.
D. Net Acre: The total land area of the PUD exclusive of all-private roads and/or
public street right-of-way.
E. Usable Open Space: A generally unobstructed parcel or area of land set aside,
dedicated, or reserved for the use and enjoyment of owners and occupants of
land within the planned unit development district for recreational or open space
activities and uses. Such area shall not be devoted to private roadways, offstreet
parking or loading, or buildings and structures, except those incidental to
the recreational or open space.
5.4. Permitted Uses:
5.4-1. Residential Planned Unit Development: All residential uses including detached,
semi-detached, attached or multi-storied structures in any arrangement or
combination thereof, plus non-residential service-oriented uses of a religious,
cultural, recreational and business character that are primarily designed and
intended to serve the residents of the residential planned unit development.
5.4-2. General Planned Unit Development: Business and industrial structures and uses
exclusively or in combination with residential uses in a unified plan.
5.5. Site Development Standards: Compliance with the following standards, in
addition to those that may be required by other provisions of this Ordinance and
the Subdivision Regulations shall be required:
5.5-1. Lot Area and Yard Requirements: No minimum lot size, frontage or yard
requirements within the PUD shall be required except those dictated by health, fire
safety, function and screening considerations; provided, however, that the PUD
will not injure nor hinder or prevent the development of surrounding property in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
5.5-2. Height Limitations: No maximum limits on building heights shall be required,
except those that may relate to airports and landing zones.
5.5-3. Access: All lots should have direct access to a public or private road except
residential dwellings, which need not front on a road but which must have access
thereto via a court, walkway, or other area dedicated to public use or owned or
maintained by a homeowners' association.
5.5-4. Building Location and Area: The location and arrangement of all structures,
parking areas, walks, lighting and appurtenant facilities should be shown on the
preliminary development plan and shall be compatible with the surrounding land
uses and the purposes of the planned unit development district; any part of a PUD
not used for structures, parking or loading areas, or accessways shall be
landscaped, screened or otherwise improved. In residential planned unit
developments, the total ground area occupied by structures and buildings shall not
exceed 35% of the total ground area of the PUD.
5.5-5. Street Standards: All private roads, off-street parking areas, and public right-ofway
shall be surfaced with asphalt or concrete and shall be so graded and
drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulated within the area.
5.5-6. Density: Any development plan that does not propose more dwelling units per net
acre than would be permitted pursuant to the R-3 District regulations shall be
qualified for preliminary approval only insofar as residential density is concerned.
A greater number of dwelling units per net acre may be permitted, but if the
number exceeds that which would be permitted under the R-3 District regulations
by more than ten percent (10%), the developer has the burden to show that such
excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on the existing public facilities
and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The Planning
Commission, in determining the reasonableness of a proposed increase in the
number of dwelling units per net acre, shall recognize that increased density may
be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in
public services to be achieved by: 1) the amount, location and proposed use of
common open space; and 2) the location, design and type of dwelling units. The
Planning Commission shall, in its determination, also consider that the physical
characteristics of the site make increased densities appropriate in the particular
location.
5.5-7. Open Space: The application for residential PUD shall set aside an area equal to
not less than 20% of the total planned unit development for usable open space.
The development plan shall include such provisions for the ownership and
maintenance of the common open space as are reasonably necessary to insure
that remedial measures will be available to the City if the common open space is
permitted to deteriorate or is not maintained in a condition consistent with the best
interest of the planned development or of the City.
5.5-8. Screening: When business or manufacturing structures or users in a planned unit
development district abut a residential district or residential buildings in the same
development, screening shall be provided.
5.6. Procedure for Designation of a Planned Development District.
5.6-1. Preliminary Conference: Any owner or developer proposing to develop a planned
unit development pursuant to this Article may confer with the Planning staff before
submitting an application for rezoning to the PUD District. The preliminary
conference would enable the Planning staff to review the proposed development in
sketch form and to explain the requirements and procedures of this Article to the
owner or developer. The sketch plan would show the location of the proposed
development, approximate building sizes and locations, vehicular access drives,
location of existing utilities, surrounding right-of-way, pavements, and property
lines.

approval but remains in substantial compliance with the plan as submitted for
tentative approval, the Planning Commission may, after meeting with the
landowner, refuse to grant final approval and shall within forty-five (45) days from
the filing of the application for final approval so advise the landowner in writing of
said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons why one or more said
variations are not in the public interest. The landowner may either treat the
refusal as a denial of final approval and resubmit said final plan in accordance with
the request of the Planning Commission, or he or she may notify the Planning
Commission, within forty-five (45) days of notice of the date of refusal, his or her
notice to appeal the decision of the Planning Commission. In the event such an

Permits will be issued only when the permit application is in precise conformance
to the approved Final Development Plan, and the Director of Planning so certifies
on the permit application.
5.10. Staged Development: In accordance with the schedule proposed in the
application for approval of the Preliminary Plan, the developer may elect to file an
application for final approval of only a geographic area of the total planned unit
development and delay, within the time limits authorized in the ordinance approving
the Preliminary Plan, application for final approval of other areas. In applying the
provisions of this section, where the proposed Final Development Plan is
submitted in stages, the Planning Commission may permit in each area deviations
from the number of dwelling units per acre established for the entire planned unit
development, provided such deviation shall be adjusted for in other sections of the
development so that the number of dwelling units per acre authorized for the entire
planned unit development is not affected. The developer shall furnish such
performance bond, escrow deposit, or other financial guarantees as may be
determined by the Planning Commission to be reasonably required to assure
performance in accordance with the development plan and to protect the public
interest in the event of abandonment of said plan before completion.

site and in relation to surrounding land uses.
9.2. General Requirements. No building permit shall be issued for the construction of

the consideration of any such proposal or proposals, the planning
commission shall establish a date and time for the conduct of a public
hearing, allowing sufficient time for notice to be given.
C. Notice shall be given by publication in the same manner as notice is given

recommendations, the governing body may establish an interstate highway
sign and/or advertising sign district by ordinance, which ordinance shall
include a description of the boundaries of the district and shall set forth all
standards and regulations regarding the permitted interstate highway signs
therein. The details of such ordinance may be different in any respect to
those contained in the original proposal or in the planning commission’s
recommendation, except that the governing body may not increase the
area of the district beyond that which was described in the published notice
of hearing. The governing body may suspend the proceedings for the
purpose of directing the publication of a new notice and the conduct of a
public hearing by the planning commission as to any expansion of the
proposed area of the district.

ARTICLE XII
NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, USES, BULK AND SIGNS
12.1. Applicability: This Article applies only to lots, buildings, structures, signs and
non-building uses in existence on the effective date of these Regulations. The
lawful use of any premises existing on the effective date of these regulations may
be continued as hereinafter provided, although neither such use nor bulk conforms
to these Regulations. To avoid undue hardship and to protect lawfully vested
rights, nothing in this Article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any buildings on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of these Regulations and upon which
construction has diligently proceeded.
12.2. Nonconforming Lots of Record:
12.2-1. Single Lot: In any zoning district in which single-family structures are
permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may
be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of
this Ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of
this Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that
yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or
width, or both, of the lot, shall conform to the zoning regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the Joint Board of Zoning Appeals.
12.2-2. Lots with Continuous Frontage: If two (2) or more lots or combinations of
lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of
record at the time of passage of this Ordinance and if all or part of the lots
do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the land
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of
this Ordinance and no portion of said parcel shall be used in a manner
which diminished compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by this Ordinance nor shall any division of any parcel be made
which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this
Ordinance.
12.3. Nonconforming Uses of Land: Where, at the time of passage of this Ordinance,
a lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the Zoning Regulations
imposed by this Ordinance, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, provided that:
A. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of
the lot or parcel other than that actively occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
B. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was actively being used at the time such use became
nonconforming, notwithstanding the fact that the user thereof may own, or have an
equitable or a leasehold interest in and to a larger land area than that in active
use.
C. No additional structure not conforming to the requirement of this Ordinance shall
be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
12.4. Structures With Nonconforming Bulk:
12.4-1. Authority to Continue: Any structure which is devoted to a use which is
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is either
nonconforming as to bulk or area requirements or which is located on a lot
which does not comply with the applicable bulk regulations, may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions
in Section 12.4-2 through 12.4-4.
12.4-2. Enlargement, Repair, Alterations: Normal maintenance and repairs,
structural alteration, enlargement, or remodeling of a building or structure
with nonconforming bulk is permitted if the same does not increase the
degree of existing nonconformity or create any new nonconforming bulk in
such building or structure. Provided, however, any existing structure which
is not less than 5 feet from any side yard, located in any addition to the
City of Newton platted prior to July 1, 1950, may be substantially rebuilt,
altered, repaired, remodeled or enlarged providing said existing structure
and enlargement meet all other provisions of this Ordinance.
12.4-3. Damage or Destruction: Any structure which is nonconforming as to bulk,
and which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of
fifty percent (50%) or more of its current market value as of date of
damage or destruction, excluding the valuation of the land, shall not be
repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with these regulations. Any such
structure or any part thereof which is damaged to an extent less than fifty
percent (50%) excluding the assessed valuation of the land may be
repaired or restored provided that a building permit is obtained and
substantial reconstruction is undertaken within one year after such damage
and is diligently pursued to completion. Otherwise such building, structure
or part thereof shall thereafter be occupied only by a conforming use, and
shall conform to the bulk requirements of these regulations. Proof of value,
if needed, shall be by three appointed appraisers; one by the owner, one
by the City and one by the other two appraisers. Cost of the appraisals
shall be borne by the owner.
12.4-4. Moving: No structure described in Section 14.2-1 shall be moved in whole
or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or
any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved.
12.5. Nonconforming Uses:
12.5-1. Authority to Continue: Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part or all
of a structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land may be
continued, so long as otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained
in Sections 12.5-2 through 12.5-8 and 12.8.
12.5-2. Repair, Maintenance and Remodeling:
A. Normal maintenance and incidental repair, or replacement, installation or
relocation of non-bearing walls, non-bearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing,
may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use; provided, however, that it does not extend the nonconforming
use nor violate any other provisions of this Article.
B. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public
official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such
structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition (where such
restoration will not be in violation of any other provisions of this Article).
C. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be
remodeled unless the entire structure and use thereof shall thereafter conform to
all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, except as provided in
12.5-7 of this Article.
12.5-3. Extension or Enlargement: No structure that is devoted in whole or in part
to a nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged or added to
in any manner unless such structure and the use thereof conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
12.5-4. Damage or Destruction: Any structure which is occupied by a
nonconforming use, and which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other
causes to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of last full value as
shown by the Assessor's records, excluding the assessed valuation of the
land, shall not be re-occupied by the nonconforming use unless the Joint
Board of Zoning Appeals permits the resumption of the nonconforming use
under Section 12.5-5 of this Ordinance. Any such structure or any part
thereof which is damaged to an extent less than fifty percent (50%) of last
full value as shown by the Assessor's records, excluding the assessed
valuation of the land, may be repaired or restored as per Section 12.4-3 of
this Ordinance.
12.5-5. Abandonment or Discontinuance: In order for the nonconforming use of
land, structure, or structure and land in combination, to lawfully continue,
the same must be a continuous active use. Cessation of such active
nonconforming use of land, structure, or structure and land in combination
for nine (9) consecutive months or for fifteen (15) months during any twoyear
period shall cause the forfeiture of such nonconforming use privilege.
Any subsequent use of land, structure or structure and land in combination
thereafter shall conform to the regulations and uses permitted in the district
in which such land or structure is located, except that a forfeited
nonconforming use privilege shall lawfully resume should the Newton/North
Newton Area Planning Commission under Section 12.8 of this Ordinance
permit the substitution of a nonconforming use.
12.5-6. Nonconforming Accessory Uses: No use which is accessory to a principal
nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or
terminate.
12.5-7. Nonconforming Residential Uses: Notwithstanding the provision of Sections
12.5-2 and 12.5-3, any structure which is devoted to a residential use and
which is located in a commercial or industrial district, may be remodeled,
extended, expanded and enlarged; provided that after any such
remodeling, extension, expansion, or enlargement, such structure shall not
be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units
than such structure accommodated prior to any such work.
12.6. Status of Special Use Permit: Any use which lawfully exists at the effective date
of this Ordinance as a special permit use under the terms of this Ordinance shall
not be deemed to be a nonconforming use in such district but shall, without further
action, be considered a conforming use.
12.7. Nonconforming Signs: All existing signs which are not specifically permitted or
which do not comply with all of the provisions of these regulations for the zoning
district in which it is located, as of the date of adoption of these regulations, shall
be considered nonconforming signs.
12.7-1. Repairs and Damage: Nonconforming signs may not, after the effective
date of these regulations, be enlarged, structurally altered or extended
unless such sign shall be made to comply with all of the provisions of these
regulations, except that normal repairs and repainting of nonconforming
signs are permitted. When a permanent nonconforming sign is destroyed
or damaged by any means to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of
its present day replacement value, it shall not thereafter be restored unless
such sign shall be made to conform to all of the provisions of these
regulations.
12.8. Substitution or Reinstatement of Nonconforming Uses:
12.8-1 The Joint Board of Zoning Appeals may permit the substitution of a
nonconforming use for an existing or forfeited nonconforming use and may permit
specified structural alterations provided that the parking requirements for the proposed
use as prescribed in Article X of this Ordinance are either complied with, or are amended
through a variance as provided in Section 13.3 of this Ordinance.
12.8-2 When a nonconforming use has been changed to any conforming use, it
shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use; except, however, that the
Joint Board of Zoning Appeals may permit the reinstatement of a nonconforming
residential use of a structure located in a commercial zoning district if the essential
character and appearance of the existing structure is that of a residential structure, and if
the Board finds that such reinstatement will not place any unreasonable burdens or
create any unreasonable conflicts with existing commercial uses or with the further
commercial development of the district or area in which such structure is located.
12.8-3 In authorizing any substitution or reinstatement of nonconforming uses, the
Board may attach thereto such conditions and restrictions regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed structure or used as it may deem
necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purpose of the Code and in the public
interest.

procedures and standards set forth in Sections 13.3-2 and 13.3-4 of this article.
C. To hear and decide upon applications for temporary structure and use permits
provided such use is of a temporary nature and does not involve the erection of a
substantial structure. A zoning certificate for such use shall be granted in the form
of a temporary and revocable permit for not more than 12 months subject to such
conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, conveniences and general
welfare.
D. To hear and decide upon applications for a substitution of nonconforming use
pursuant to Article XII, Section 7.8 of the Zoning Code.
E. To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any regulations, requests
for interpretation of any map and all other matters referred to it upon which the
Board is required or authorized to pass by this Ordinance.
F. In exercising the abovementioned powers, the Board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as shall be proper, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative
officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of a majority of
members present shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision
or determination of any such administrative official or to decide in favor of the
applicant or any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance, or
to effect any variation in this Ordinance.
13.1-8. Finality and Judicial Review of Decisions: All decisions and findings of the
Joint Board of Zoning Appeals on appeal or upon application for a
temporary structure and use permit or substitution of a nonconforming use
shall be final decisions, and shall in all instances be subject to judicial
review provided in K.S.A. 12-715. Any person, official or governmental
agency aggrieved with any decision or determination of the Joint Board of
Appeals may present a petition within fifteen (15) days after the filing of the
Board's decision, to the District Court of Harvey County to determine the
reasonableness of any such order of determination.
13.2 Appeals to the Joint Board of Zoning Appeals:
13.2-1. Authorization: An appeal from a decision of the Zoning Administrator or
any other administrative official or agency with respect to the interpretation
or application of this Ordinance may be taken to the Joint Board of Zoning
Appeals by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or
governmental agency or body affected by such decision of the Zoning
Administrator, or other administrative official or agency.
13.2-2. Time for Appeals: The Board of Appeals shall prescribe the time for taking
appeals by general rule. Appeals shall be taken within the prescribed time
by filing a notice of appeal to the Joint Board of Zoning Appeals specifying
the grounds therefore and paying the fee specified. The official or agency
from whom the appeal is taken, when notified by the Board or its agent of
such appeal, shall forthwith transmit to the Board all of the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed was based.
13.2-3. Stay of Proceedings: An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator or
other administrative official or agency certifies to the Joint Board of Zoning
Appeals, after notice of the appeal has been filed, that by reason of
specified facts stated in the certificate of a stay would, in his/their
judgment, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, the
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
which may be granted by a court of record upon application; upon notice to
the Zoning Administrator; and upon due cause shown.
13.2-4. Hearing and Notice: The Joint Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a
reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal or any other matter
referred to it. Public notice of the time, place, date and subject of such
hearing shall be published once in the official City newspaper at least
twenty (20) days prior to the date fixed for hearing. A copy of such notice
shall be mailed to each party in interest. Any party in interest
may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent or by
attorney.
13.2-5. Decision: The Joint Board of Zoning Appeals shall render a written
decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay after the close of the
hearing, and in all cases, within thirty (30) days after the close of the
hearing. In rendering the decision, the Joint Board of Zoning Appeals shall
be bound by the provisions of this Ordinance.
13.3. Variances:
13.3-1. Authorization of Variances: The Joint Board of Zoning Appeals may
authorize such variances from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be
contrary to the public interest. Variances may be authorized only when the
Board has made findings of fact based upon the specific standards set
forth in Section 13.3-4 of this Article, that owing to special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will, in an individual
case, result in unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee or occupant of
land or structures.
13.3-2. Application for Variance: A written application for a variance shall be filed
with the Joint Board of Zoning Appeals which shall contain the following
information, as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by
rule or regulation of the Joint Board of Zoning Appeals:
A. The particular requirements of this Ordinance which prevent the proposed use or
construction.
B. The characteristics of the subject property which prevent compliance with the
requirement of this Ordinance.
C. The reduction of the minimum requirements of this Ordinance which would be
necessary to permit the proposed use or construction.
D. The particular hardship which would result if said particular requirements were
applied to the subject property or structure.
13.3-3. Notice and Hearing: Notice shall be given in the manner required for
hearings on appeals by Section 13.2-4 of this Article; provided that in
addition to the time, place, date and subject, such notice shall also include
a description of the property involved and a brief description of the relief
sought.
13.3-4. Standards for Granting Variances: The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not
grant a variance as authorized by Section 13.3-1 of this Article unless it
shall, in each case, make specific written findings of fact directly based
upon the evidence presented to it that support conclusions that:
A. The variance requested arises from such conditions which are unique to the
property in question and which are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district
and which were not created by an action of the property owner or the applicant.
B. The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent
property owners or residents nor will it confer upon the applicant any special
privileges denied by this Ordinance to other land or structures in the same district.
C. The strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance from which a variance is
requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the applicant.
D. The variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order,
convenience or welfare.
E. The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land or structure.
F. Granting the variance requested will not be opposed to the general spirit and
intent of this Ordinance.
13.3-5. Conditions and Restrictions: In granting a variance, temporary structure
and use permit, or a substitution of a nonconforming use, the Board may
impose such conditions, safeguards and restrictions upon the subject
property as may be necessary to insure compliance with the standards set
forth in Section 13.3-4, to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect
of such variance upon other property, and to fulfill the general purposes
and intent of this ordinance. Failure to comply with any of the conditions or
restrictions imposed on the variance shall constitute a violation of this
ordinance.
13.3-6. Prohibitions: Under no circumstances shall the Board of Appeals grant a
variance to allow a use that is not permissible under the terms of this
ordinance in the district involved. No nonconforming use of adjacent lands
or structures in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of
adjacent lands or structures in the same district and no permitted or
nonconforming use of lands or structures in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
13.3-7. Decision: The decision shall be rendered in the manner required and
subject to the provisions of Section 13.2-5 of this Article.
ARTICLE XIV
FLOOD PLAIN ZONING DISTRICT
14.1. Statutory Authorization. The provision for flood plain protection is adopted
pursuant to the authorization contained in Kansas Statutes Annotated Sections 12-
705, 12-707, 12-710 and 12-734, 735 (1973 Supp.).
14.2. Purpose. The uncontrolled use of flood plains, rivers and streams, as well as
filling, construction and certain other land practices in the flood plain of the City of
Newton adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare and impairs the tax
base of the City. In addition, extraordinary public expenditures may be required
for the protection of persons and property and for the relief of distress in areas
subject to periodic flooding. Therefore, it is the purpose of this section to:
14.2-1. Prohibit the placement of fill, materials, and structures which would obstruct
flood flows and decrease the storage capacity of the floodway.
14.2-2. Protect human life and health, prevent property damage, minimize business
interruptions and minimize rescue and relief efforts, which generally must
be undertaken at public expense.
14.2-3. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve
such uses, provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
14.2-4. Minimize expenditures of public monies for costly flood control projects and
minimize the damage to public facilities in the flood plain, such as water
mains, sewer lines, streets and bridges.
14.2-5. Minimize flood blight areas and maintain property values and a stable tax
base adjacent to the floodplain.
14.2-6. Discourage the victimization of unwary home and land buyers.
14.2-7. To assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community
to purchase flood insurance in the Federal Flood Insurance Program.
14.3. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by
this section is considered to be reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based
on engineering and scientific methods of study, review and evaluation conducted
by the Federal Insurance Administration. However, larger floods may occur on
rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural
causes. This section does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damage. This section shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer
or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
section or on any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
14.4. Definitions: Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.
Appeal means a request for a review of the Zoning Administrator's interpretation of any
provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the flood plain within a community subject to a
one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Channel is a natural or
artificial watercourse of perceptible extent, with a definite bed and banks to confine and
conduct continuously or periodically flowing water. Channel flow thus is that water which
is flowing within the limits of the defined channel. Development means any manmade
change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or
other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations.
Flood or Flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
2. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means
an official map of a community, on which the Flood Insurance Study has delineated the
Flood Hazard Boundaries and the zones establishing insurance rates applicable to the
community.
Flood Insurance Study is the official report provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the Flood Boundary-
Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Flood Profile is a graph or a longitudinal profile showing the relationship of the watersurface
elevation of a flood event to location along a stream or river.
FloodPlain is the land adjacent to a body of water which has been or may be hereafter
covered by floodwater including but not limited to the regulatory flood.
Flood-Proofing means a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments
to properties and structures subject to flooding primarily for the reduction or elimination
of flood damages to properties, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and contents of
buildings in a flood hazard area.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Floodway Fringe is that area of the flood plain, outside of the floodway, that on the
average is likely to be flooded once every 100 years (i.e. that has a one percent (1%)
chance of flood occurrence in any one year).
Lowest Floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's
lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance.
Manufactured Home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain management
purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and
other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For
insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel
trailers, and other similar vehicles.
Manufactured Home Park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
New construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on
or after the effective date of this ordinance.
Obstruction is any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel rectification, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence,
rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any
channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood hazard area which may impede, retard, or
change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting
debris carried by such water, or that is placed where the flow of water might carry the
same downstream to the damage of life or property.
Start of construction means (for other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, Pub. L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation
for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as
a mobile home.
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent (50%) of the market value of
the structure either (1) before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the structure
has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the
purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of
a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any
alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State
Inventory of Historic Places.
Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this ordinance which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific
enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
14.5. General Provisions:
14.5-1. Lands to Which the Flood Plain Section Applies. This section shall apply to
all flood plain areas within the City of Newton and to all flood plain areas in
incorporated territory lying outside of but within three (3) miles of the
nearest point of the City limits provided that the unincorporated territory
has not been designated a flood plain zone or district by any other
government unit or subdivisions.
14.5-2. Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration
through a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance
Study for the City of Newton" with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and any revision thereto
are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
ordinance.
14.5-3. National Flood Insurance. Nothing in this section or in any regulations
adopted hereunder shall be construed as affecting the eligibility of any
existing structure upon the publication of the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
14.5-4. Compliance. No structure, land or water shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable
regulations.
14.5-5. Establishment of Development Permit. A development permit shall be
required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance.
14.5-6. Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances
on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact
location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning
map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Zoning Administrator shall
make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation
is contested, the Board of Zoning Appeals will resolve the dispute. The
regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing
factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person contesting
the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence,
if he so desires.
14.5-7. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This ordinance is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
14.5-8. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of ordinance, all
provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally
construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to limit or
repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
14.6. Development Permit:
14.6-1. Permit Required. No persons, firm or corporation shall initiate any
development or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a
separate permit for development for each such building or structure.
14.6-2. Application for Permit. To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file an
application therefore in writing on a form furnished for that purpose. Every
such application shall:
A. Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which the
application is made.
B. Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot, block tract
and house and street address, or similar description that will readily identify and
definitely locate the proposed building or work.
C. Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended.
D. Be accompanied by plans and specifications for proposed construction.
E. Be signed by the permittee or his authorized agent who may be required to submit
evidence to indicate such authority.
F. Within designated flood prone areas, be accompanied by elevations (in relation to
mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) or in the case of
floodproofed non-residential structures, the elevation to which it has been
floodproofed. Documentation or certification of such elevation will be maintained
by the Zoning Administrator.
G. Provide a certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the
non-residential floodproofed structure is adequate to be watertight with walls
impermeable to the passage of water and withstand the hydrodynamic forces
associated with the 100-year flood.
H. Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as
a result of the proposed development.
1) Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State
Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submit copies of such notifications to the Administrator;
2) Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained.
I. Give such other information as reasonably may be required by the Zoning
Administrator.
1) A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the stream, elevation
of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas to
be corrupted by the proposed development and higher water information.
2) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent
structure, fill or storage elevations, size, location and spatial arrangement
of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevation of
streets, water supply, sanitary facilities, photographs showing existing land
uses and vegetation upstream and downstream, soil types, and other
pertinent information.
3) Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the
stream.
14.6-3. Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall review all building
permit applications to determine if the site of the proposed development is
reasonably safe from flooding, and that all necessary permits have been
received as required by Federal or State law.
14.7. Variance Procedures:
14.7-1. The Board of Zoning Appeals of the City shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance and shall
hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator,
in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
14.7-2. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in
other sections of this ordinance, and:
A. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
B. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
C. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the
effect of such damage on the individual owner;
D. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
E. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
F. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage,
for the proposed use;
G. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
H. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain
management program for that area;
I. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
J. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
and
K. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
L. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, providing items A, B, and C of Section 14.7-5 have been fully considered.
As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
14.7-3. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
ordinance.
14.7-4. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
14.7-5. Conditions for Variances:
A. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
B. Variances shall only be issued upon (1) a showing of good and sufficient cause,
(2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and (3) a determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of
the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
C. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a written notice that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting
from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
D. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
14.8. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction:
14.8-1. General Standards. In all area of special flood hazards, the following
provisions are required:
A. All new construction including manufactured homes and substantial improvements
shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
B. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed with
materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
C. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by
methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
D. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
E. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into floodwaters.
F. On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding.
G. The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant,
flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited.
H. Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major
damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if readily removable
from the area within the time available after flood warning.
I. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
14.8-2. Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood
elevation data has been provided, the following provisions are required:
A. Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one
or more feet above base flood elevation.
B. Nonresidential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation, or floodproofed
to one or more feet above the base flood elevation. This shall include attendant
utility and sanitary facilities. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied.
C. In those areas where base flood elevation data have not been provided, the
Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in
order to administer the provisions of Section 14.8.
D. Agricultural Uses on a Special Use Permit Basis. Refer to Section 4.5-2 of this
Ordinance.
E. Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
14.8-3. Manufactured Homes and Residential Subdivisions.
A. All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Manufactured homes must be anchored in accordance with state and
local building codes and FEMA guidelines. In the event that over-the-top frame
ties to ground anchors are used, the following specific requirements (or their
equivalent) shall be met:
1) Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four corners of the
manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate
locations and manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring one
additional tie per side.
2) Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five additional ties
per side at intermediate points and manufactured homes less than 50 feet
long requiring four additional ties per side.
3) All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying a force of
4,800 pounds.
4) Any additions to the manufactured home be similarly anchored.
B. Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zones A1-30, AH and AE
on the community's FIRM, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation;
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in
accordance with the provisions of Section 14.8-3-A.
C. Standards for Residential Subdivision Proposals.
1) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments, including
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage.
2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce
exposure to flood hazards.
4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and
other proposed development (including proposals for manufactured home
parks and subdivisions), which is greater than either 50 lots or 5 acres.
14.8-4. In the Floodway Portion of the Flood Plain District.
A. Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other developments are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
B. The storage of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive
or potentially injurious to human life or property shall be prohibited; storage of

safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other nearby property.
ii.The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to
the property in question.
iii.Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience.

purposes of these regulations as identified in Section 24-101.
(b) VARIANCE FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. When a plat is
presented that includes land for which a planned unit development plan

24.110 INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT.
(a) INTERPRETATION. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. These
regulations shall be construed broadly to promote the purposes for which
they are adopted.
(b) PUBLIC PROVISIONS. The provision of these regulations are not
intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or
regulation, statue, or other provision of law except as provided in these
regulations. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, or other provision
of law, the provision that is more restrictive or imposes higher standards
shall control.
(c) PRIVATE PROVISIONS. The provisions of these regulations are not
intended to abrogate any easement, covenants, or other private
agreement; provided, that where the requirements of these regulations
are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulation than such
easement, covenant, or private agreement, the requirements of these
regulations shall govern.
(d) A subdivision of land, that was not lawful at the time of the adoption of
these regulations, shall not become or be made lawful solely by reason of
adoption of these regulations.
(e) The provisions of these regulations are cumulative and are additional
limitations upon all other laws and ordinances heretofore passed or which
may be passed hereafter governing any subject matter in the provisions
of these regulations.
24.111 SEVERABILITY. If any part or provision of these regulations or application
thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall affect only the part, provision, or
application directly challenged in the action in which such judgment is rendered
and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of the regulations or
the application thereof.
24.112 VESTED RIGHTS.
(a) SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. Development rights in
single family residential development shall vest upon recording of a final
plat of such land. If construction is not commenced on such land within
five years of recording a plat, the development rights in such shall expire.
Except for lots in a recorded plat, any remaining contiguous lots or tracts
of land within the area divided under this rule held in common ownership
at the conclusion of said five (5) year period shall be considered a single,
unplatted lot and subsequent divisions of said lot shall be platted in
conformance with the subdivision regulations then in effect.
8
(b) NON-SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. For all purposes
other than single-family developments, the right to use land for a
particular purpose shall vest upon the issuance of all permits required for
such use by the City, and construction has begun, and substantial
amounts of work have been completed under a validly issued permit.
Persons who obtain a validly issued permit on a lot or tract of land
created under the provisions of the previous subdivision regulations shall
be permitted to develop said property so long as the permit issued does
not expire. Failure to start construction under said permit before the
expiration of the permit shall not protect the owner from the provisions of
these regulations or the Newton/North Newton zoning regulations.

in compliance with all local laws and regulations applicable at the time

makes a determination on the record that compliance with any of those
local laws and regulations is reasonably necessary to protect public
health and safety.

ARTICLE 4. MINIMUM SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
24.401PURPOSE. The purpose of this article is to provide reasonable standards of design
for the subdivision and resubdivision of land. The Planning Commission shall study
and review all subdivision plats in relation to the general character of the area, the
general requirements of the community, and the particular requirements of the
neighborhood. These design standards shall guide private and public policy regarding
the efficient layout and design of public improvements.
24.402PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER CONNECTIONS. No preliminary plat shall be
approved unless the Planning Commission determines that public facilities will be
adequate to support and service the area of the proposed subdivision. The intent is to
maximize local municipal coordination of public facilities in accordance with the
comprehensive plan and capital improvement program.
24.403GENERAL DEVELOPMENT. Subdivisions, resubdivisions and all related
improvements shall be planned, designed, and constructed in accordance with the
standards and specifications set forth in this Article.
(a) A subdivision shall be designed to comply with the Newton-North Newton
Comprehensive Plan.
(b) The name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or closely approximate
that of any existing development within the postal delivery areas of
Newton. The Planning Commission shall approve all subdivision names.
(c) The name of any new subdivision road shall not duplicate or closely
approximate that of any existing road within the postal delivery area of
Newton. The Planning Commission shall approve all street names.
(d) The purchase and installation of all facilities and utilities shall be the
responsibility of the developer. No building permit may be issued unless
the City Engineer inspects and certifies that all public improvements have
been properly installed.
(e) The Planning Commission may require the dedication of parklands (or a
payment in lieu of parklands), open space, easements for the
construction of public streets and sidewalks, and such other lands that
are necessary to further the goals of the comprehensive plan. All such
dedications shall be generally proportional to the impact of development.
(f) All subdivisions shall be designed according to “best practices” that
emphasize good landform and drainage, the preservation of natural
features, safe transportation facilities, and promote the goals of
pedestrian and traffic connectivity.
(g) The Planning Commission shall have the power to impose reasonable
conditions on the subdivision of land as a valid exercise of the police
power granted to Kansas municipalities to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of current and future residents.
(h) Any land that the Planning Commission finds unsuitable for subdivision
and subsequent development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep
slopes, rock formations, topography, inadequacy of utility easements, or
other features that will reasonably effect the public health, safety, and
20
welfare shall not be subdivided or developed until reasonable and
adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the
Planning Commission to solve the problems of adverse development
conditions.
24.404LOT DESIGN AND LAYOUT. All lots and landform design shall be planned in
accordance with the following general standards.
(a) The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building
setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision for the type
of development and use contemplated.
(b) All subdivisions shall conform to policies for subdivision design in the
comprehensive plan and regulations contained in the Zoning Ordinance of the
Cities of Newton and North Newton.
(c) All lots shall be designed and arranged with safe access to a public street.
Where driveway access from a arterial or a collector street may be necessary for
several adjoining lots, the Planning Commission may require that such lots be
served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards.
(d) Lot arrangement shall be designed to provide positive drainage to the municipal
storm water system.
(e) All subdivisions shall conform to the requirements of the Newton or North Newton
Flood Plain Regulations.
(f) Side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the street lines, unless a
variance is granted to provide a better street and lot plan. The angle of variation
will be marked on the plat. Lot lines shall be straight, when not adjacent to street
right-of-way.
(g) Flag lots or private travel easements shall not be permitted except by a specific
plat variance issued by the Planning Commission.
(h) The minimum lot areas and widths, measured at the setback lines, shall conform
to the requirements of the Newton-North Newton Zoning Ordinance.
(i) Lots that front upon a cul-de-sac or curved street having a radius of 200 feet or
less shall be measured at the building setback line along an arc parallel to the
right-of-way of such cul-de-sac or curved street. Such lots shall also be laid out
so that their lot frontage, as measured on the arc of such right-of-way line, is not
less than fifty (50) percent of the required lot width measured at the building
setback line.
(j) The maximum depth of all lots shall not exceed two and one-half times the width
of the lot. The width of an irregularly shaped lot shall be measured at the rear lot
line.
(k) All lot corners and points-of-intersection shall be monumented in accordance a
1/2 inch by 24 inch iron bar set in concrete.
(l) Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate
building setback from an orientation to both streets.
(m) Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where they
are needed to provide for the separation of residential development from arterial
21
streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. No
access shall be allowed from individual lots to arterial streets.
(n) If an owner places restrictions on any lot that are greater than those
imposed by these subdivision regulations, or by the Zoning Ordinances of
Newton or North Newton, such restrictions or a reference thereto shall be
placed on the final plat.
24.405BLOCKS. Intersecting streets determining block lengths shall be provided at such
intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing and future streets. In
residential districts, where no existing plats are recorded, the blocks shall not exceed
1,300 feet in length, unless previous adjacent layout or topographical conditions justify
a variation from this requirement. Blocks planned for residential purposes should be of
sufficient width to allow for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for
commercial or industrial use shall be designed specifically for such purpose, with
adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading.
24.406STREETS AND CIRCULATION. The plan for general circulation and the development
of all streets shall be prepared in accordance with the following standards.
(a) CLASSIFICATION. The arrangement of arterial, collector, and local
streets shall conform to the major thoroughfare system and policies
identified in the comprehensive plan.
(b) TOPOGRAPHY. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography.
Local streets may be designed to a curvilinear, gridiron, or modified-grid
system. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography. Steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
(c) ARRANGEMENT. All streets shall be properly integrated with the
existing and proposed system of streets and dedicated rights-of-way.
Additionally, all streets shall be properly related to specific traffic
generators and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
i) Where required by the Planning Commission, rights-of-way shall be
provided for extending streets to adjoining unsubdivided property.
Land in such rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the appropriate
City.
ii) Rights-of-way shall be designated along all section and quarter
section lines. Section line right-of-way shall be for arterial streets;
quarter-section right-of-way shall be for collector streets at their
designated widths, unless topographic conditions or other
circumstances justify otherwise.
iii) Where a proposed subdivision abuts an approved subdivision
containing future street rights-of-way, the developer of the
proposed subdivision shall construct the street and all required
improvements from the proposed subdivision to the approved street
in the existing subdivision.
iv) New streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the subdivision
to provide access to adjoining property, and shall intersect with
existing streets.
22
v) When a subdivision borders on, or contains a railroad right-of-way
or a limited access highway, the Planning Commission may require
a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-ofway,
at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with due
regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade
separations.
vi) Local streets shall be so designed as to discourage through or
non-local traffic.
vii) Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out to intersect, as
nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other
conditions justify a variation from the right angle intersection, the
Planning Commission may authorize a variation with a minimum
angle of eighty (80) degrees.
viii) When deemed necessary, the developer shall provide appropriate
traffic calming.
(d) CONNECTIVITY. In order to promote connectivity to adjacent properties,
every plat shall provide multiple access points, to the greatest extent
possible. Streets in a proposed subdivision must connect, where
feasible, to existing streets in abutting platted subdivisions.
(e) FRONTAGE ON IMPROVED STREETS. No subdivision shall be
approved unless it has access to a public street that has been suitably
improved.
(f) PUBLIC STREETS. All proposed new streets in a new subdivision shall
become public streets and dedicated to the City of Newton or North
Newton following a final inspection by the City Engineer. The subdivider
shall warrant all repairs and reasonably necessary changes on the
streets for a period of one year following the date of final acceptance by
the City.
(g) HALF-STREET. Dedication of half-streets shall not be approved.
(h) PRIVATE STREETS. Private streets are generally discouraged;
however, when private streets are approved as part of a subdivision, they
shall meet the design standards for local streets of these regulations.
Approval of a subdivision involving a private street shall be solely at the
discretion of the Planning Commission. The right-of-way width and
roadway width for private streets are the same as those required for
public streets. Turnaround provision for private streets, with a single point
of ingress and egress, are the same as are required for public streets.
Applications for a private street shall be accompanied by a development
agreement, which shall be recorded with the Harvey County Register of
Deeds as part of the final plat. This agreement shall establish the
conditions under which the street will be constructed and maintained, as
well as the conditions controlling an offer of dedication, and shall
stipulate:
i) The street shall be constructed and maintained to conform to the
Newton Design Standards and Standard Construction
Specifications.
23
ii) The owners of the abutting lots will include, with any future offer for
dedication, sufficient monies, as estimated by the City Engineer, to
restore the street to conformance with municipal standards.
iii) An offer for dedication of the street shall be made only for the street
as a whole.
iv) The method of assessing maintenance and repair costs.
(i) GRADING AND CONSTRUCTION PLAN. All streets shall be designed,
graded, and improved in accordance with the design and construction
standards of the City of Newton or North Newton.

Major Streets – 350 Feet
Local Streets – 100 Feet
A tangent of 25 feet, minimum, shall be provided between all
reversed curbs to provide for a smooth flow of traffic.
(k) TEMPORARY TURNAROUND. When a temporary turnaround is
provided on a street that is to be extended in the future, the Planning
Commission, with the assistance of the City Engineer, shall establish the
width of the turnaround and the need for temporary easements.
Temporary cul-de-sacs shall have, as a minimum, the same dimensions
as a permanent cul-de-sac.
(l) CUL-DE-SACS. Permanent cul-de-sacs (dead end streets) shall not be
longer than 600 feet and a turn-around not less than 50 feet in radius
shall be provided at each terminus to provide adequate provision for turnaround
of emergency or commercial vehicles, such as fire trucks and
school busses.
(m) ACCESS MANAGEMENT. Access management includes the control of
the spacing, location of driveways, side streets and intersections.

permitted.
iii) DRIVEWAY SPACING ON ARTERIAL, COLLECTOR AND LOCAL
STREETS. For arterial and collector streets, no driveway shall
intersect the arterial or collector street within 150 feet of an
intersecting street or driveway on the same property. For local
streets, no driveway shall intersect the local street within 75 feet of
another intersecting local street, except that a driveway for a lowdensity
residential development may be reduced to 40 feet.
(n) STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL USE. The minimum
right-of-way width of streets adjacent to an area designed, proposed, or
zoned for commercial or industrial use may be increased by the Planning
Commission to such extent as the Commission may deem necessary to
assure the free flow of through traffic without interference from parked or
parking vehicles.
i) MARGINAL STREET ACCESS. When blocks or lots in a proposed
commercial or industrial subdivision front on any limited access
highway or arterial street, the subdivider may be required to
dedicate a marginal access street to provide ingress and egress to
and from such blocks or lots.
(o) ACCESS TO ARTERIALS. When a subdivision is proposed to front on
an arterial street, the following standards shall apply:
i) The subdivision shall be prepared so that the rear of all lots fronts
the arterial street unless an intervening frontage access street is
provided. No access shall be permitted from the lots directly to the
arterial street and the developer shall provide an additional setback
distance to separate the dwellings from the street R.O.W. and erect
screening and sound absorbing systems.
ii) As an alternative, and approved by the Planning Commission, the
subdivision may be separated from the arterial streets by a service
or frontage road. The frontage road shall be separated from the
arterial street by at least 20 feet and planted with grass and other
landscaping material suitable for a sound barrier.
