In accordance with such plan and program for the emergency management of this Village,

programs, and to take all other preparatory steps, including the partial or full mobilization of

§ 28-12. Financing.
It is the intent of the Village Board and declared to be the policy of the Village that every effort
shall be made to provide funds for disaster emergencies.
It is the Village Board's intent that the first recourse shall be to funds regularly appropriated to the
Agency. If the Mayor finds that the demands placed upon these funds in coping with a particular
disaster are unreasonably great, and the Governor has proclaimed the Village a disaster, he may
make application for funds from the state disaster relief fund. If monies available from the fund are
insufficient, and if the Mayor finds that other sources of money to cope with the disaster are not
available or are insufficient, he shall issue a call for an immediate session of the Village Board for
the purpose of enacting ordinances as the Village Board may deem necessary to transfer and
expend monies appropriated for other purposes, or borrow monies from the United States
Government or other public or private sources. If less than a quorum of the members of the Village
Board is capable of convening in session to enact such ordinances for the transfer, expenditure or
loan of such monies, the Mayor is authorized to carry out those decisions until such time as a
quorum of the Village Board can convene.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the Mayor's authority to apply for,
administer and expend grants, gifts, or payments in aid of disaster prevention, preparedness,
response or recovery.

A local disaster emergency may be declared only by the Mayor or Village Board. If declared by the
Mayor, it shall not be continued for a period in excess of seven days except by or with the consent
of the Village Board. Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing or terminating a local
disaster emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity, and shall be filed promptly with
the Village Clerk.
The effect of a declaration of a local disaster emergency is to activate any and all applicable local
emergency operations plans and to authorize the furnishing of aid and assistance thereunder.
During a local disaster emergency, the Mayor may suspend the provisions of any municipal
ordinance prescribing procedures for the conduct of municipal business, or the orders, rules and
regulations of any municipal agency, if strict compliance with the provisions of any ordinance, rule
or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the
emergency, as authorized by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act (20 ILCS 3305/1 et
seq.), provided that if the Village Board meets at such time, the Mayor shall act subject to the
directions and restrictions imposed by that body.
§ 28-14. Testing of disaster warning devices.
The testing of disaster devices, including outdoor warning sirens, shall be held only on the first
Tuesday of each month at 10:00 in the morning.
§ 28-15. Mutual aid arrangements between political subdivisions.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
The Coordinator for emergency management operations may, in collaboration with other public
agencies within his immediate vicinity, develop or cause to be developed mutual aid arrangements with
other political subdivisions, municipal corporations or bodies politic within this state for reciprocal
disaster response and recovery in case a disaster is too great to be dealt with unassisted. The mutual
aid shall not, however, be effective unless and until approved by each of such political subdivisions,
municipal corporations or bodies politic as are parties thereto, in the manner provided by law, and
unless and until filed with and approved in writing by the State Director. Such arrangements shall be
consistent with the state and local emergency management operations plan and program, and in the
event of such disaster as described in § 28-9 of this article, it shall be the duty of each local
government and department for emergency management operations to render assistance in
accordance with the provisions of such mutual aid arrangements.
§ 28-16. Communications.
The local Emergency Management Agency shall ascertain what means exist for rapid and efficient
communications in times of disaster emergencies. The Agency shall consider the desirability of
supplementing these communications resources or of integrating them into a comprehensive system or
network. In studying the character and feasibility of any system or its several parts, the Agency shall
evaluate the possibility of multipurpose use thereof for general municipal and local governmental
purposes. The Agency shall make recommendations to the Mayor as appropriate.
§ 28-17. Immunity; rights unaffected.
Neither the Village, the Agency or any member thereof or any person acting at their direction, engaged
in any emergency management operations or disaster activities, while complying with or attempting to
comply with this article or any rule or regulations promulgated pursuant to this article, is liable for the
death of or any injury to persons, or damage to property, as a result of such activity. This section does
not, however, affect the right of any person to receive benefits to which he would otherwise be entitled

Occupational Diseases Act (820 ILCS 310/1 et seq.), or under any pension law, and this section does
not affect the right of any such person to receive any benefits or compensation under any Act of
Congress.
§ 28-18. Professions, trades and occupations.
If such disaster as is described in § 28-9 occurs in this Village and the services of persons who are
competent to practice any profession, trade or occupation are required in this Village to cope with the
disaster situation and it appears that the number of persons licensed or registered in this Village to
practice such profession, trade or occupation may be insufficient for such purpose, then any persons
who are licensed elsewhere to practice any such profession, trade or occupation may, if a member of
another political subdivision rendering aid in this Village pursuant to the order of the head of that
political subdivision and upon the request of the Village, or if otherwise requested so to do by the
Mayor or the Coordinator of this Village, during the time the disaster condition continues, practice such
profession, trade or occupation in this Village without being licensed or registered in this Village.
§ 28-19. Appropriations and levy of tax.
The Village Board may make appropriations for emergency management operations in the manner
provided by law for making appropriations for the ordinary expenses of such political subdivision. The
Village Board may also levy for emergency management operations a tax not to exceed 0.05% of the
full, fair cash value as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue on all taxable property in
the Village for the current year. However, the amount collectible under such a levy shall in no event
exceed $0.25 per capita. The annual tax shall be in addition to and in excess of the amount authorized
to be levied for general corporate purposes.
§ 28-20. Authority to accept services, gifts, grants or loans.
Whenever the federal or state governments, or any agency or officer thereof, or whenever any person,
firm or corporation shall offer to the Village services, equipment, supplies, materials or funds by way of
gift or grant for purposes of emergency management, the Village, acting through the Mayor or through
its Village Board, may accept such offer; and upon such acceptance the Mayor or the Village Board
may authorize any officer of the Village to receive such services, equipment, supplies, materials or
funds on behalf of the Village.
§ 28-21. Orders, rules and regulations.
The Mayor shall file a copy of every rule, regulation or order and any amendment thereof made by
him pursuant to the provisions of this article in the office of the Village Clerk. No such rule,
regulation or order, or any amendment thereof, shall be effective until 10 days after such filing;
provided, however, that upon the declaration of such a disaster emergency by the Mayor as is
described in § 28-13, the provision relating to the effective date of any rule, regulation, order or
amendment issued pursuant to this article and during the state of such disaster emergency is
abrogated, and said rule, regulation, order or amendment shall become effective immediately
upon being filed with the Village Clerk, accompanied by a certificate stating the reason for the
emergency.
The Emergency Management Agency established pursuant to this article, and the Coordinator
thereof, shall execute and enforce such orders, rules and regulations as may be made by the

and personnel of all such departments, offices and agencies are directed, upon request, to cooperate
with and extend such services and facilities to the Coordinator and the Emergency Management
Agency.
§ 28-23. Limitations on private liability.

compensation grants a license or privilege or otherwise permits the designation or use of the
whole or any part or parts of such real estate or premises for the purpose of sheltering persons

§ 45-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this Identity Theft Prevention Program (Program) is to protect customers of the

policies and procedures to facilitate the detection, prevention and mitigation of identity theft in
connection with the opening of new covered accounts and activity on existing covered accounts.
§ 45-2. Scope.
This Program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying information of a customer
of one or more of the utilities operated by the municipality (electric, natural gas, water and wastewater)
by any and all personnel of the municipality, including management personnel. This Program does not
replace or repeal any previously existing policies or programs addressing some or all of the activities
that are the subject of this Program, but rather it is intended to supplement any such existing policies
and programs.
§ 45-3. Definitions.
When used in this Program, the following terms have the meanings set forth herein, unless the
context clearly requires that the term be given a different meaning:
COVERED ACCOUNT
An account that the municipality offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family or
household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments of transactions.
[16 CFR 681.1(b)(3)(i)] A utility account is a "covered account." The term "covered account"
also includes other accounts offered or maintained by the municipality for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to customers, the municipality or its customers from identity theft.
[16 CFR 681.1(b)(3)(ii)]
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

identify a specific person, including any name, social security number, date of birth, official
state or government-issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number,
government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number. Additional
examples of identifying information are set forth in 16 CFR 1022.3(h).
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
IDENTITY THEFT
A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information of another person without
authority. [16 CFR 681.1(b)(8) and 16 CFR 603.1(a)]
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
RED FLAG
A pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft.
Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the
FTC's Identity Theft Rules (16 CFR Part 681) or the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C.
§ 1681 et seq.), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, enacted

The initial adoption and approval of the Identity Theft Prevention Program shall be by ordinance of
the Village Board of Trustees. Thereafter, changes to the Program of a day-to-day operational
character and decisions relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Program may be
made by the Village President (Program Administrator). Major changes or shifts of policy positions
under the Program shall only be made by the Board of Trustees.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Development, implementation, administration and oversight of the Program will be the
responsibility of the Program Administrator. The Program Administrator may, but shall not be
required to, appoint a committee to administer the Program. The Program Administrator shall be
the head of any such committee. The Program Administrator will report at least annually to the
Village Board of Trustees regarding compliance with this Program.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Issues to be addressed in the annual Identity Theft Prevention Report include:
The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft in
connection with the opening of new covered accounts and activity with respect to existing
covered accounts.
Service provider arrangements.
Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response.
Recommendations for material changes to the Program, if needed for improvement.
§ 45-5. Identification of red flags.
The municipality has considered the guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from
the FTC's Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the municipality's past history with instances of
identity theft, if any. The municipality hereby determines that the following are the relevant red flags for
purposes of this Program given the relative size of the municipality and the limited nature and scope of
the services that the municipality provides to its citizens:
Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or service
providers.
A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report or an identity verification
response from a credit reporting agency.
A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a
consumer report.
A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in Section
681.1(b) of the FTC's Identity Theft Rules.
A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual
pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:
A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established
credit relationships; or
An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a
financial institution or creditor.

The presentation of suspicious documents.
Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or forged.
The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the
appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification.
Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the
person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification.
Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that
is on file with the municipality, such as a signature card or a recent check.
An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having
been destroyed and reassembled.
The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address
change.
Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external
information sources used by the municipality. For example:
The address does not match any address in the consumer report or CRA ID Check
response; or
The social security number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security
Administration's Death Master File.
Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other
personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of
correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.
Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as
indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the municipality. For example:
The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent
application; or
The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent
application.
Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent
activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the municipality. For example:
The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or
The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.
The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or
other customers.
The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the account number
or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening
accounts or other customers.
The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal
identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is
incomplete.

Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying
information that is on file with the municipality.
If the municipality uses challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the
customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be
available from a wallet or consumer report.
The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account.
Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the municipality
receives a request for the addition of authorized users on the account.
A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud.
For example: the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no
subsequent payments.
A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used
(taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other
relevant factors).
Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although usage of utility
products or services continues in connection with the customer's covered account.
The municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.
The municipality is notified of unauthorized usage of utility products or services in connection
with a customer's covered account.
Notice of possible identity theft. The municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft,
a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a
person engaged in identity theft.
§ 45-6. Detection of red flags.
The employees of the municipality that interact directly with customers on a day-to-day basis shall
have the initial responsibility for monitoring the information and documentation provided by the
customer and any third-party service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and
the modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red flags that might
arise. Management shall see to it that all employees who might be called upon to assist a
customer with the opening of a new account or with modifying or otherwise accessing an existing
account are properly trained such that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags
identified in this Program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to recognize the red
flags identified in this Program shall not open a new account for any customer, modify any existing
account or otherwise provide any customer with access to information in an existing account
without the direct supervision and specific approval of a management employee. Management
employees shall be properly trained such that they can recognize the relevant red flags identified
in this Program and exercise sound judgment in connection with the response to any unresolved
red flags that may present themselves in connection with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or accessing of an existing account. Management employees shall be responsible for
making the final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the
manner in which a prospective new customer may apply for service, the information and
documentation to be provided by the prospective customer in connection with an application for a

new utility service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer with the
application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in which the information and
documentation provided by the customer and any third-party service provider shall be maintained.
Such policy shall be generally consistent with the spirit of the Customer Identification Program
rules (31 CFR 103.121) implementing Section 326(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act but need not be as
detailed. The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth
the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall establish their identity before being
allowed to make modifications to or otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
§ 45-7. Response to detected red flags.
If the responsible employees of the municipality as set forth in the previous section are unable,
after making a good faith effort, to form a reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a
customer attempting to open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing account
based on the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party service
provider, the municipality shall not open the new account or modify or otherwise provide access to
the existing account as the case may be. Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts
or the modification or access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the
municipality and shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the steps
to be taken in the event of an unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to
aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that
results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a notice that a customer has provided
account information to a fraudulent individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or
mitigate identity theft when a red flag is detected include:
Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
Contacting the customer.
Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a
covered account.
Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
Not opening a new covered account.
Closing an existing covered account.
Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt
collector.
Notifying law enforcement.
Determining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances.
§ 45-8. Initial risk assessment for covered accounts.
Utility accounts for personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of "covered account" in the FTC's Identity Theft Rules. Therefore, the municipality determines
that with respect to its residential utility accounts it offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The
municipality also performed an initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or
maintains any other accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or the
utility from identity theft. In making this determination the municipality considered the methods it uses

to open its accounts, the methods it uses to access its accounts, and its previous experience with
identity theft, and it concluded that it does not offer or maintain any such other covered accounts.
§ 45-9. Program updates.
The Program, including relevant red flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually
to reflect changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the Program update
include:
An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or procedures.
Changes in methods of identity theft.
Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and
service provider arrangements.
§ 45-10. Training and oversight.
All staff and third-party service providers performing any activity in connection with one or more
covered accounts are to be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that
the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and
mitigate the risk of identity theft.

Article II. Vacancies in Office
[Adopted as Ch. 1, Art. II, Div. V, of the 2015 Code]
(65 ILCS 5/3.1-10-50)
§ 82-9. Vacancy by resignation.
A resignation is not effective unless it is in writing, signed by the person holding the elective office, and
notarized.
1/14/2020 Village of Westville, IL
https://www.ecode360.com/print/WE3840?guid=33050119,33050223,33050235,33050264,33050286,33050392,33050403,33050491,33050524,3… 41/491

Unconditional resignation. An unconditional resignation by a person holding the elective office may
specify a future date, not later than 60 days after the date the resignation is received by the officer
authorized to fill the vacancy, at which time it becomes operative, but the resignation may not be
withdrawn after it is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy. The effective date of a
resignation that does not specify a future date at which it becomes operative is the date the
resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy. The effective date of a
resignation that has a specified future effective date is that specified future date or the date the
resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy, whichever date occurs later.
Conditional resignation. A resignation that does not become effective unless a specified event
occurs can be withdrawn at any time prior to the occurrence of the specified event, but if not
withdrawn, the effective date of the resignation is the date of the occurrence of the specified event
or the date the resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy, whichever date
occurs later.
Vacancy upon the effective date. For the purpose of determining the time period that would require
an election to fill the vacancy by resignation or the commencement of the sixty-day time period
referred to in § 82-13, the resignation of an elected officer is deemed to have created a vacancy
as of the effective date of the resignation.
Duty of the Clerk. If a resignation is delivered to the Clerk of the Village, the Clerk shall forward a
certified copy of the written resignation to the official who is authorized to fill the vacancy within
seven business days after receipt of the resignation.
§ 82-10. Vacancy by death or disability.
A vacancy occurs in an office by reason of the death of the incumbent. The date of the death may be
established by the date shown on the death certificate. A vacancy occurs in an office by permanent
physical or mental disability rendering the person incapable of performing the duties of the office. The
corporate authorities have the authority to make the determination whether an officer is incapable of
performing the duties of the office because of a permanent physical or mental disability. A finding of
mental disability shall not be made prior to the appointment by a court of a guardian ad litem for the
officer or until a duly licensed doctor certifies, in writing, that the officer is mentally impaired to the
extent that the officer is unable to effectively perform the duties of the office. If the corporate authorities
find that an officer is incapable of performing the duties of the office due to permanent physical or
mental disability, that person is removed from the office and the vacancy of the office occurs on the
date of the determination.
§ 82-11. Vacancy by other causes.
Abandonment and other causes. A vacancy occurs in an office by reason of abandonment of
office; removal from office; or failure to qualify; or more than temporary removal of residence from
the Village, as the case may be. The corporate authorities have the authority to determine whether
a vacancy under this section has occurred. If the corporate authorities determine that a vacancy
exists, the office is deemed vacant as of the date of that determination for all purposes, including
the calculation under § 82-13 or § 82-14.
Guilty of a criminal offense. An admission of guilt of a criminal offense that, upon conviction, would
disqualify the municipal officer from holding the office, in the form of a written agreement with state
or federal prosecutors to plead guilty to a felony, bribery, perjury, or other infamous crime under
state or federal law, constitutes a resignation from that office, effective on the date the plea
agreement is made. For purposes of this section, a conviction for an offense that disqualifies a
municipal officer from holding that office occurs on the date of the return of a guilty verdict or, in
the case of a trial by the court, on the entry of a finding of guilt.

Election declared void. A vacancy occurs on the date of the decision of a competent tribunal
declaring the election of the officer void.
§ 82-12. Election of Acting Mayor.
The election of an Acting Mayor pursuant to § 82-14 or § 82-15 does not create a vacancy in the
original office of the person on the Village Board, unless the person resigns from the original office
following election as Acting Mayor. If the person resigns from the original office following election as
Acting Mayor, then the original office must be filled pursuant to the terms of this article and the acting
Mayor shall exercise the powers of the Mayor and shall vote and have veto power in the manner
provided by law for a Mayor. If the person does not resign from the original office following election as
Acting Mayor, then the Acting Mayor shall exercise the powers of the Mayor but shall be entitled to
vote only in the manner provided for as the holder of the original office and shall not have the power to
veto. If the person does not resign from the original office following election as Acting Mayor, and if that
person's original term of office has not expired when a Mayor is elected and has qualified for office, the
Acting Mayor shall return to the original office for the remainder of the term thereof.
§ 82-13. Appointment to fill Trustee vacancy.
An appointment by the Mayor or Acting Mayor, as the case may be, of a qualified person as described
in § 82-4 of this Code to fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee must be made within 60 days after the
vacancy occurs. Once the appointment of the qualified person has been forwarded to the corporate
authorities, the corporate authorities shall act upon the appointment within 30 days. If the appointment
fails to receive the advice and consent of the corporate authorities within 30 days, the Mayor or Acting
Mayor shall appoint and forward to the corporate authorities a second qualified person as described in
§ 82-4. Once the appointment of the second qualified person has been forwarded to the corporate
authorities, the corporate authorities shall act upon the appointment within 30 days. If the appointment
of the second qualified person also fails to receive the advice and consent of the corporate authorities,
then the Mayor or Acting Mayor, without the advice and consent of the corporate authorities, may make
a temporary appointment from those persons who were appointed but whose appointments failed to
receive the advice and consent of the corporate authorities. The person receiving the temporary
appointment shall serve until an appointment has received the advice and consent and the appointee
has qualified or until a person has been elected and has qualified, whichever first occurs.
§ 82-14. Election to fill vacancies in municipal offices with fouryear
terms.
If a vacancy occurs in an elective municipal office with a four-year term and there remains an
unexpired portion of the term of at least 28 months, and the vacancy occurs at least 130 days
before the general municipal election next scheduled under the general election law, then the
vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the term at that general municipal election. Whenever
an election is held for this purpose, the Village Clerk shall certify the office to be filled and the
candidates for the office to the proper election authorities as provided in the general election law.
If a vacancy occurs with less than 28 months remaining in the unexpired portion of the term or less
than 130 days before the general municipal election, then:
Mayor. If the vacancy is in the office of Mayor, the vacancy must be filled by the corporate
authorities electing one of their members as acting Mayor. Except as set forth in § 82-12, the
Acting Mayor shall perform the duties and possess all the rights and powers of the Mayor until
a Mayor is elected at the next general municipal election and has qualified. However, in
villages with a population of less than 5,000, if each of the Trustees either declines the
election as Acting Mayor or is not elected by a majority vote of the Trustees presently holding

Board of Trustees, as the case may be.

If the Mayor is temporarily absent because of an incapacity to perform official duties, but the
incapacity does not create a vacancy in the office, the corporate authorities shall elect one of their

perform the duties and possess all the rights and powers of the Mayor but shall not be entitled to
vote both as Mayor pro tem and as a Trustee.

It shall be the duty of the Village Attorney to prepare such ordinances as may be required by the

§ 87-2. Introduction.
When a proposed ordinance is introduced, it shall be read one time by title only and referred to the
proper committee unless the Board of Trustees shall otherwise specifically direct.
§ 87-3. Votes required.
The passage of all ordinances for whatever purpose, and of any resolution or motion to create any

concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office on the Village Board, including the Mayor,
unless otherwise expressly provided by the Code or any other act governing the passage of any
ordinance, resolution, or motion; provided that, where the Board consists of an odd number of
Trustees, the vote of the majority of the Trustees shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance. The yeas
and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of the designated ordinances, resolutions, or
motions and recorded in the journal of the Village Board. In addition, the corporate authorities at any
meeting may, by unanimous consent, take a single vote by yeas or nays on the several questions of

designated ordinances, orders, resolutions and motions included in such omnibus group or consent
agenda. The taking of such single or omnibus vote and such entries of the words "omnibus vote" or
"consent agenda" in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this section
for all intents and purposes and with like effect as if the vote in each case had been separately by yeas
and nays on the question of the passage of each ordinance, order, resolution and motion included in
such omnibus group, and separately recorded in the journal. Likewise, the yeas and nays shall be

the Village Board by the Mayor shall be reconsidered by the Village Board at the next regular meeting

reconsideration, 2/3 of all the Trustees then holding office on the Village Board agree at that regular
meeting to pass an ordinance, resolution, or motion, notwithstanding the Mayor's refusal to approve it,
then it shall be effective. The vote on the question of passage over the Mayor's veto shall be by yeas
and nays and shall be recorded in the journal. (65 ILCS 5/3.1-40-50)

same as though it were a part of each and every separate section. Any person convicted of a
violation of any section of this Village Code, where any duty is prescribed or obligation imposed, or
where any act is of a continuing nature or declared to be unlawful, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day such duty or
obligation remains unperformed or such act continues, unless otherwise specifically provided in
this Village Code.
In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by different clauses or
sections of this Village Code, the prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed, but not
more than one recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense; provided that
the revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar any
other penalty being enforced.
Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a breach of any section or
provision of this Village Code, and there shall be no fine or penalty specifically declared for such
breach, the provisions of this Code shall apply and a separate offense shall be deemed committed
upon each day during or on which a breach or violation occurs or continues.
§ 93-4. Liability of officers.
The failure of any officer or employee to perform any official duty imposed by this Code shall not
subject such officer or employee to the penalty imposed for violation of this Code, unless a penalty is

and prosecuting attorney's fee, in amounts set from time by the Board of Trustees by resolution, shall
be paid by the respondent pursuant to such order.
§ 93-13. Administrative Review Law to apply.
The findings, decision and order of the Hearing Officer shall be subject to the review on the Circuit
Court for the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Vermilion County, Illinois and the provisions of the Administrative
Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.) and all amendments and modification thereto, and the rules
adopted pursuant thereto, are adopted and shall apply to govern every action for the judicial review of
the findings, decision and order of the Hearing Officer under this article.
§ 93-14. Enforcement of judgment.
Any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other sanction or costs imposed,
remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures
under the Illinois Administrative Review Law are a debt due and owing to the Village and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law.
After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law
may be sought for a final determination of a Village Code violation, unless stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision and order of the Hearing Officer may be enforced in
the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
In any case in which a respondent has failed to comply with an order directing the respondent to
correct a Village Code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a Village Code
violation, any expenses incurred by the Village to enforce the order, including, but not limited to, its
attorney's fees, court costs and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are
fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be due and owing the Village and may be collected
in accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a Hearing Officer pursuant
to this subsection, the Village shall provide a notice to the respondent that states that the
respondent shall appear at a hearing before the Hearing Officer to determine whether the
respondent has failed to comply with the order. The notice shall set the date for such hearing,
which shall not be less than seven days from the date that notice is served. If notice is served by
mail, the seven-day period shall begin to run on the date that the notice was deposited in the mail.
Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, a
lien shall be imposed upon the real estate of the respondent in the amount of any debt due and
owing under this article. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien
pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
The Hearing Officer may set aside any order entered by default and set a new hearing date upon
a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of the order of default, if the Hearing Officer
determines that the respondent's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any
time if the respondent establishes that the Village did not provide proper service of process. If any
judgment is set aside pursuant to this subsection, the Hearing Officer shall have the authority to
enter any order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the
Village as a result of the vacated default order.
§ 93-15. Sanctions applicable to property and property owner.
An order to correct a Village Code violation and the sanctions imposed by the Village as a result of a
finding of a Village Code violation under this article shall attach to the property as well as to the
property owner, so that a finding of a Village Code violation against one property owner cannot be
avoided by conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent transferee or

It shall be a defense to a Village Code violation charged under the Village's building or zoning codes
which establish construction, plumbing, heating, electrical, fire prevention, sanitation or other health
and safety standards that are applicable to the structures in the Village, if the respondent proves by a
preponderance of the evidence that:
The alleged Village Code violation does not, in fact, exist or at the time of the hearing the violation
has been remedied or removed;
The Village Code violation has been caused by the current property occupants and that, in spite of
reasonable attempts by the respondent to maintain the dwelling free of such violations, the current
occupants continue to cause the violations; or
An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the respondent or his agents to all or
part of the dwelling for the purpose of correcting the Village Code violation.

Article XXVI. Sexual Harassment Policy
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 97-81. Harassment prohibited.
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual
harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the Village of Westville to prohibit harassment of any person by any
municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of
sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies
or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment
relationship or lack thereof.
§ 97-82. Sexual harassment defined.
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which
currently defines sexual harassment as:
Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature
when:
Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an
individual's employment;
Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
employment decisions affecting such individual; or
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex,
anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or
statements about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
Nonverbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually
suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls," "smacking" or "kissing" noises.
Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or
websites.
Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced
sexual act or actual assault.
Textual/Electronic. "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including
pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and
threats via all forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages,

intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook
and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end
of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on
individual perception and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard
of what would offend a "reasonable person."
§ 97-83. Reporting procedure.
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself to be the object
of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly
communicating her/his position to the offending employee and her/his immediate supervisor. It is
not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment, including the
following:
Electronic/Direct communication. If there is sexually harassing behavior in the workplace, the
harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is
unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal.
If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
Contact with supervisory personnel.
At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels
threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of
human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief
executive officer of the municipality.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not
assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the
victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be
presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough
and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be
identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right
to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with those
entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is
a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must also be filed within 300 days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said or done, the date,
the time and the place), including, but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos
and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless of how
the matter comes to the attention of the municipality. However, because of the serious implications
of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component of an
effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.

No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal agency or office shall
take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an
investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of this policy; or
Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy.
For the purposes of this policy, "retaliatory action" means the reprimand, discharge, suspension,
demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of
any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith is not
substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or
practice of any officer, member, state agency, or other state employee that the state employee
reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation,
hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state
agency or other state employee; or
Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act [740 ILCS 174/15(a)], an employer may not retaliate against an
employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative
commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation. In
addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a
government or law enforcement agency where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. [740 ILCS
174/15(b)]
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a
person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has
opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion
after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC may file a retaliation charge, either due within 300 days
of the alleged retaliation.
§ 97-85. Penalty for violating policy.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies,
employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements,

any person who violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS
430/565 may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the
municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law
or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any
fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency.
§ 97-86. Penalty for false reporting.
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment
report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting
sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven.
Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false
report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge
pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the
State Police, a State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to
$5,000 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

occasional drivers; leased drivers and independent, owner-operator contractors who are either
directly employed by or under lease to the Village or who operate a commercial motor vehicle at
the direction of or with the consent of the Village. For the purpose of pre-employment/pre-duty
testing only, the term "driver" includes a person applying to the Village to drive a commercial motor
vehicle.
SAFETY-SENSITIVE FUNCTION
Any of those on-duty functions set forth in 49 CFR 395.2, Paragraphs (1) through (9).
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 97-90. Use prohibited.
The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance or
alcohol is prohibited on all Village premises, in any Village-owned or -leased motor vehicle, or other
location at which the driver is to perform work; nor will the Village hire or retain any individual who uses
or possesses any illegal drug, in any amount and regardless of frequency, or any individual who
engages in prohibited alcohol-related conduct.
The Village will maintain a pre-employment screening program designed to prevent hiring anyone
who uses any illegal drugs, or engages in prohibited alcohol-related conduct.
No driver will consume any Schedule 1 drug of the Schedule of Controlled Substance of the Drug
Enforcement Administration or any amphetamines, narcotics, opiates, hallucinogenic substances,
depressants, stimulants, or any other habit-forming drug while on or off duty, except as provided in
this article.
No driver shall report for work or drive while impaired by any drug, controlled substance, or with an
alcohol breath concentration of 0.02 or greater.
A driver may use a substance administered by or under direction of a physician who has advised
the driver that the substance will not affect the driver's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.
No driver may operate any motor vehicle whose motor senses, sight, hearing, balance, reaction,
reflexes or judgment are or may be presumed affected or who has consumed any alcohol within
four hours.
Any driver who sells or otherwise dispenses illegal drugs or alcohol to others on Village premises,
in or from a Village-owned or -leased motor vehicle, is subject to immediate termination.
§ 97-91. Testing.
Drug testing. The Village will require drug testing in accordance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Requirements as set forth in 49 CFR Part 40. Effective August 15, 1994, all urine samples shall be
split-samples. The "primary sample" shall be at least 30 ml of urine; the "split sample" shall be at
least 15 ml. Failure of the driver to provide that quantity even after a two-hour second opportunity
following drinking up to 24 ounces of water will cause the driver to be referred for a medical
evaluation to develop pertinent information whether the driver's inability to provide a specimen is
genuine or constitutes a refusal to test. The medical evaluation shall go to the MRO, who will
make a conclusion in writing to the Village. While this process is being accomplished, the driver
shall be placed out of service.
Alcohol testing.
The Village will require alcohol testing in accordance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Requirements as set forth in 49 CFR Part 40. Two breath tests are required to determine if a
person has a prohibited alcohol concentration. A "screen test" shall be conducted first. Any

result less than 0.02 alcohol concentration is considered a "negative test." If the alcohol
concentration is 0.02 or greater, a second or "confirmation test" must be conducted. This test
shall be by a "Evidential Breath Testing" (EBT) device that prints out the results, date, time, a
sequential test number, name and serial number of the EBT. The alcohol test must be
conducted by a "Breath Alcohol Technician" (BAT) who is trained to operate that EBT and is
proficient in all breath alcohol testing procedures.
Drivers shall only be tested for alcohol while performing a safety-sensitive function, or just
after performing a safety-sensitive function. Any test 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 shall
cause the driver to immediately be removed from driving or any other safety-sensitive function
for at least 24 hours. Failure of the driver to provide an adequate amount of breath will cause
the driver to be immediately referred for a medical evaluation to develop pertinent information
whether the driver's inability to provide the adequate amount of breath is genuine or
constitutes a refusal to test. The physician shall submit a written medical evaluation to the
MRO, who will make a conclusion in writing to the employer. While this process is being
accomplished, the driver shall be placed out of service.
Types of testing.
For the purpose of compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier regulations, all drivers will be
required to take and successfully pass urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing. Refusal
to submit to such screening is considered a positive test.
Pre-employment. Applicants for positions as drivers will also be required to take and
successfully pass urine drug tests and alcohol breath test before they can be used as drivers;
except applicants that have taken part in qualified programs in the last 30 days and been
tested in the last six months or in a random program in the last 12 months with no positive
results.
The following information must be obtained on any new driver from previous employers for
the past two years: any positive drug test or alcohol test of 0.04 or greater, including any
refusals to be tested. Every new employee shall provide to the Village a written release which
authorizes the Village to obtain the driver's past drug and alcohol test results. No driver shall
be used for more than 14 days while these test results are being secured. Regulations
prohibit the use of any driver after 14 days if these test results have not been obtained. Any
driver found to have had a positive test result in these two years shall cause the employer to
further obtain information on the subsequent Substance Abuse Professional's evaluation
and/or determination under 49 CFR 382.605 and determine if there was compliance with 49
CFR 382.309 and 382.311. If not, the driver cannot be used until in full compliance.
Periodic. All drivers may be required to submit to a urine drug test and breath alcohol test at
least every two years at the same time as the biennial medical examination occurs.
Reasonable cause. Any driver suspected of drug or alcohol use as a result of reasonable
evidence upon reporting to work during the work day, or upon completion of his day's work
activity, may be subjected to a reasonable cause urine drug or breath alcohol test. Refusal to
submit to such screening will be considered a positive test. A reasonable cause observation
form must be completed and signed by at least one qualified supervisor within 24 hours of the
observation that led to a reasonable cause test.
Random testing.
The Village will randomly select 50% of all employees each year for drug testing and
25% of all employees each year for breath alcohol testing per the requirements of 499
CFR 382.305 and 49 CFR Part 40.
On a monthly basis, the Medical Review Officer (MRO) will, from the total group, select
randomly on his computer a number to be tested that on an annual basis will equal 50%

of that total group for random drug testing and 25% for breath alcohol testing. This same
process will be repeated each month.
Once the MRO makes the monthly selections, he will forward that list to the consortium,
which will notify the employer under whose drug policies those selected are covered. The
Village will be given a date before which the individual must be tested per these random
selection processes. The person to be tested shall not be informed of the need to be
tested except just prior to the actual test being performed.
Failure of the Village to accomplish the above requirements in the time allotted will cause
them to be out of compliance with the random testing requirements of 49 CFR Part 40.
Post-accident testing.
The Village will require post-accident urine drug and breath alcohol testing of all
employees covered by this policy as required by 49 CFR 382.303 and 49 CFR Part 40.
Post-accident urine drug and breath alcohol testing will be required of those employees
who are involved in an accident if the driver receives a citation for a moving traffic
violation arising from the accident, there is a fatality or serious accident involving bodily
injury or significant property damage.
The post-accident urine drug test shall be conducted as soon as possible but not later
than 32 hours after the reportable or fatal accident. If the test is not administered, the
employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not
promptly completed. If a breath alcohol test is not conducted within two hours, a record
shall be prepared and retained stating why. If in eight hours a test is still not conducted,
all attempts shall cease and a complete record made of why it was not accomplished. In
addition, the driver shall not consume any alcohol for at least eight hours following an
accident or until a breath alcohol test has been accomplished.
A driver who is seriously injured and cannot provide a urine specimen or breath alcohol
test at the time of the accident shall provide the necessary authorization for obtaining
medical records and reports that would indicate if a controlled substance or alcohol was
in the driver's system and the level present.
The employer shall provide the driver with sufficient procedures so that the driver can
meet the requirements of Subsection C(7)(a), (b), (c), (d), and comply with all provisions
of 49 CFR Part 40.
Failure of the driver to be readily available or refusal to give a urine sample or breath
alcohol test when the driver has been involved in a fatal accident, accident involving
serious bodily injury, or accident with significant property damage, or received a citation
for a moving violation, except for a driver who meets the conditions of Subsection C(7)
(d), shall be considered a refusal to take a test and a positive test result.
§ 97-92. Test results.
Drug test results. Test results will be reviewed to determine whether there is any indication of a
controlled substance abuse.
The test results will be reviewed by a Medical Review Officer (MRO). If there is any evidence
of a positive result, the MRO will give the person tested an opportunity to discuss the results
and provide documentation of legally prescribed medication.
The results will be released to the Medical Review Officer, who will then release the results to
the Village, which will maintain them in a secure location with controlled access.

General.
The test results from all drug and alcohol tests will become a part of the driver's qualification
file, which shall be in a secured location with controlled access and retained as specified in 49
CFR 382.401.
The results will not be released to any unauthorized party without written consent. Upon
termination, every driver is required to permit in writing the release of their urine drug and
breath alcohol test results for at least two years to any future employer. Upon the receipt of a
written request of a driver, every employer is required to provide copies of all his or her urine
drug and breath alcohol test results promptly to any other possible employer at no charge.
§ 97-93. Employee assistance program.
An employee assistance program will be conducted by the Village to provide educational information
concerning the effects and consequences of drug or alcohol use on personal health, safety and work
environment.
Every driver will be required to take at least one hour of training each year on substance abuse
and alcohol use, and sign a form certifying his/her attendance.
Written notice will be given when this training is available.
§ 97-94. Compliance with laws; recordkeeping.
The Village will comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning any
violations of criminal drug and alcohol use statutes in the workplace.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Recordkeeping. All records will be retained as listed in 49 CFR 382.401.
A driver is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the driver's
use of drugs or alcohol, and test results. Access shall not be contingent upon payment for records
other than those requested.
Records shall be made available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of a written request from
a driver.
An employer may disclose information required to be maintained under this policy on a driver, to
the decision maker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of that
driver and arising from the results of an alcohol or controlled substance test required by this policy,
or from the employer's determination that the driver engaged in conduct prohibited by this policy
(including but not limited to worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, or other
proceeding related to benefits sought by the driver).
The provisions of this policy may and shall be deemed modified from time to time as may be
required by federal or state law, including as set forth in federal statutes, Code of Federal
Regulations or elsewhere, and such modifications as required by law shall be deemed
immediately incorporated herein. The Village reserves the right to interpret, change, rescind or
depart from this policy in whole or in part without notice.

of drugs or alcohol, even though the driver is terminated.
Article XXVIII. Sexual Misconduct
§ 97-96. Purpose; definition.
The Village will not tolerate and will seek to eradicate any behavior by its employees which constitutes
sexual misconduct toward another employee, volunteer, intern, or member of the public. "Sexual
misconduct" means any actual, attempted or alleged sexual molestation, assault, abuse, sexual
exploitation or sexual injury. "Sexual misconduct" does not include "sexual harassment."
§ 97-97. Reporting procedures; Sexual Misconduct Coordinator.
It is the express policy of the Village to encourage victims of sexual misconduct, and their parents or
guardians in the case of minors, to come forward with such claims. The Village shall designate a
Sexual Misconduct Coordinator who shall remain accountable for the implementation and monitoring of
this policy. The identity of the Sexual Misconduct Coordinator shall remain on file with the Village. In
order to conduct an immediate investigation, any incident of sexual misconduct shall be reported as
quickly as possible in confidence pursuant to this article.
§ 97-98. Employee responsibilities.
Employees are required to report any known or suspected incidents of sexual misconduct. They shall
report to their supervisor or the Sexual Misconduct Coordinator. If the person to whom an employee is
directed to report is the offending person, the report should be made to the next higher level of
administration or supervision.
§ 97-99. Investigation and confidentiality.
All formal complaints shall be given a full, impartial and timely investigation. During such investigation,
every effort shall be made to protect the privacy rights of all parties, although confidentiality cannot be
guaranteed.
§ 97-100. Discipline for violations.
Any Village employee who is determined, after an investigation, to have engaged in sexual misconduct
in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
§ 97-101. False accusations.

misconduct or who retaliates against any person who testifies, assists or participated in an
investigation, a proceeding or a hearing relating to a sexual misconduct complaint. Retaliation
includes, but is not limited to, any form of intimidation, reprisal or harassment.
§ 97-103. Child abuse incident reporting and follow-up.
Definitions. "Sexual child abuse," as used in this chapter, is defined as the following:
"Child" for the purposes of child abuse is defined as a person under 18 years of age, who,
prior to juvenile proceedings, has not been judicially emancipated or emancipated by
marriage.

of the infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child by a parent or any other person.
The exploitation or overwork of a child by a parent or any other person.
The involvement of the child in any sexual act with a parent or any other person, or the

other person or the child's involvement in pornographic displays, or any other
involvement of a child in sexual activity constituting a crime under the laws of this state.
Sexual abuse of a minor is a crime.
Any case of known or suspected child abuse of a minor shall be reported immediately in
compliance with Illinois mandatory reporting guidelines and to the Sexual Misconduct Coordinator,
the Village Attorney's office, and Police Department.
In the event that the Sexual Misconduct Coordinator is first notified of an incident of known or
suspected child abuse, the Sexual Misconduct Coordinator shall immediately notify the child's
parent or legal guardian as the case may be and the appropriate legal authorities as required by
state or local law. The Sexual Misconduct Coordinator shall prepare a Suspected Child Abuse
Standard Report and immediately follow up to investigate the incident and to ascertain the
condition of the child. The Sexual Misconduct Coordinator shall consult and communicate with the
Village Attorney as necessary.
Any employee involved in a reported incident of sexual misconduct and/or child abuse shall be
immediately relieved of responsibilities that involve interaction with minors or shall be suspended
as determined by the employee's supervisor. Reinstatement of employees involved in a reported
incident of child abuse shall occur only after all allegations of child abuse have been fully
investigated and resolved by the Village.

§ 97-106. Findings; applicability.
The Village finds a safe work environment is beneficial for employees and promotes productivity.
Workplace bullying has been linked to absenteeism, drug and alcohol use, and sexual violence.
The Village considers workplace bullying unacceptable and will not tolerate it. The anti-bullying
policy shall apply to all individuals who are employees, volunteers and contractors.

characteristic is prohibited in all places of employment, and an employer shall prevent bullying in its
place of employment.
No person shall be subjected to bullying:
During any period of employment activity;
While working, on property of the employer, or at employer-sponsored or employersanctioned
events or activities; or
Through the transmission of information from an employment-utilized telephone, computer,
computer network, or other similar electronic employer-utilized equipment.
Nothing in this policy is intended to infringe upon any right to exercise free expression or the free
exercise of religion or religiously based views protected under the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution.
§ 97-109. Disciplinary action.
Any employee or volunteer who is determined, after an investigation, to have engaged in bullying in
violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including immediate discharge.
Any contractor found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to contract cancellation.

harassment. Contractors are likewise prohibited from retaliating.
§ 97-110. Reporting and complaint procedure.
The Village encourages all employees, volunteers or contractors to promptly report any instance
of bullying behavior. Early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method
of resolving actual or perceived incidents of bullying. Therefore, while no fixed reporting period has
been established, prompt reporting of complaints or concerns is encouraged so that rapid and
constructive action can be taken. The Village shall make every effort to stop alleged workplace
bullying before it becomes severe or pervasive, but can only do so with the cooperation of its
employees.
Reports of bullying will be treated seriously, and investigated promptly and impartially. The Village
further encourages all individuals to whom this policy applies to formally report any concerns of
assault, battery, or other bullying behavior of a criminal nature to the Village Attorney's office. The
Village Board requires any supervisor who witnesses bullying, irrespective of reporting relationship
or his/her responsibility to address it, to promptly report this conduct to the Police Chief or the
Mayor.
Individuals who believe they have experienced conduct that they believe violates this policy, or
who have concerns about such matter, should report their complaints or concerns verbally or in
writing to their supervisor, or the Village Attorney, before the conduct becomes severe or
pervasive. If a verbal report is made, it shall be documented in writing by the official to whom it is
reported. Individuals should not feel obligated to report their complaints to their immediate

unwelcome and requesting that such behavior immediately stop.
Article XXX. Domestic and Sexual Violence Policy
§ 97-111. Findings and intent.
Domestic violence can permeate the lives and compromise the safety of employees with tragic,
destructive and often fatal results. Domestic violence occurs within a wide spectrum of relationships,
including married and formerly married couples, couples with children in common, couples who live
together or have lived together, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender couples, and couples who are
dating or who have dated in the past. Domestic violence represents a pattern of coercive tactics which
can include physical, psychological, sexual, economic and emotional abuse perpetrated by one person
against another in an intimate relationship or in the same household, with the goal of establishing and
maintaining power and control over the victim. In addition to exacting a tremendous toll from the
individuals it directly affects, domestic violence often spills over into the workplace, compromising the
safety of both victims and co-workers and resulting in lost productivity, increased health care costs,
increased absenteeism, and increased employee turnover. The Village will take appropriate actions to
promote safety in the workplace and respond effectively to the needs of victims of domestic violence.
§ 97-112. Definitions.
For purposes of this policy and pursuant to the Illinois Victims' Economic Security and Safety Act
(VESSA) (820 ILCS 180/1 et seq.), the following terms are defined as follows:

Abuse by a family or household member, as defined by this policy pursuant to Section 103 of the
Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 (750 ILCS 60/103). Domestic violence includes sexual
assault or stalking.
EMPLOYEE
A person working for the Village for remuneration for services.
FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD MEMBER
For employees with a family or household member who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence,
this means a spouse, parent, son, daughter, other person related by blood or by present or prior
marriage, another person who shares a relationship through a son or daughter, and persons jointly

Editor's Note: Original § 11-31-3 of the 2015 Code, Victims' Economic Security and Safety Act
(VESSA), which immediately followed this section, was repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch.
1, General Provisions, Art. I).
§ 97-113. Policy.
Employee awareness. The Village shall take reasonable actions to educate employees regarding
the effects of domestic violence and methods to report such violence to authorities. It is the policy
of the Village that information on domestic violence and available resources shall be available to
employees through the Village Board and by this written policy, which shall be disseminated to
employees.
Nondiscriminatory policy. Nondiscriminatory and responsive personnel policies for victimized
employees of the Village shall ensure that personnel policies and procedures do not discriminate
against victims of domestic violence and are responsive to the needs of victims of domestic
violence.
Illinois law prohibits employers from interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of
any right provided under VESSA. This law requires employers, when given 48 hours' prior
notification, to allow time off for employed victims of domestic or sexual violence and
employees with a family or household member who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence,
to take unpaid leave to seek medical help, legal assistance, counseling, safety planning, and
other assistance without penalty from the employer for the employee or the family or
household member who is a victim.
Illinois law prohibits employers from discriminating against any employee who is a victim of
domestic or sexual violence or any employee who has a family or household member who is
a victim of domestic or sexual violence.
An employee who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, or has a family or household
member who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence and whose interests are not adverse
to the employee as it relates to domestic or sexual violence, may take unpaid leave from work
to address domestic or sexual violence by:
Seeking medical attention for, or recovering from, physical or psychological injuries
caused by domestic or sexual violence to the victim;
Obtaining services from a victim services organization for the victim;
Obtaining psychological or other counseling for the victim;
Participating in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocating, or taking other
actions to increase the safety of the victim;
Seeking legal assistance or remedies to ensure the health and safety of the victim,
including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceeding related to
or derived from domestic or sexual violence.
The employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any twelve-month
period. This policy does not create a right for an employee to take an unpaid leave that
exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under, or is in addition to, the unpaid leave time
permitted by the federal Family Medical Leave Act. Leave may be taken intermittently or on a
reduced work schedule. An employee may substitute accumulated paid leave for unpaid
leave; however, the paid leave will count toward the number of workweeks used for purposes

of this policy. The employee shall provide at least 48 hours' advance notice of the employee's
intention to take leave, unless providing such notice is not practicable. No action will be taken
against an employee for failing to provide 48 hours' advance notice if the employee provides
certification that leave was used for the purposes outlined in Subsection B(2) of this section
and can demonstrate that advance notice was not practicable.
During a leave taken pursuant to this policy, the Village shall maintain coverage under its
group health plan for the duration of such leave at the level and under the conditions
coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in employment for the
duration of such leave. If the employee fails to return from leave, however, the Village may
recover any premium costs it paid for such coverage if the reason for the employee not
returning is other than the continuation, recurrence, or onset of domestic or sexual violence or
circumstances beyond the control of the employee. Neither seniority nor leave benefits will
accrue to the employee during unpaid leave.
The Village, upon request, will assist the employee in determining the best use of his/her
attendance and leave benefits when an employee needs to be absent as a result of being a
victim of domestic violence. If an employee requests time off to care for and/or assist a family
or household member who has been a victim of domestic violence, the employee's supervisor
or the Village Board (or its designee) will evaluate the employee's request for leave for
eligibility under existing law and collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee
and the attendance rules.
The Village requires certification from an employee for leave under this policy. The employee
shall certify that the leave is for one of the purposes enumerated in Subsection B of this
section. Certification shall be provided to the employer within a time period set by the
employer.
The Village understands that victims of domestic violence may lack the required
documentation or have difficulty obtaining the required certification to justify absences without
compromising their safety. Therefore, the Mayor or his designee shall consult with the
employee to identify what documentation she/he might have, or be able to obtain, that will not
compromise his/her safety-related needs and will satisfactorily meet the documentation
requirements of the employer.
All information provided to the employer pursuant to notification and certification requirements
of this policy, and the purposes for which leave may be requested pursuant to this policy, shall
be retained in strictest confidence by the employer, except to the extent that disclosure is
requested or consented to in writing by the employee, or otherwise required by applicable
federal or state law. Reported information shall be kept private to the greatest extent possible
by federal law, state law, and Village policy; however, information may have to be disclosed
pursuant to a subpoena, Illinois Supreme Court Rules, a court of law, or where otherwise
required by law. Where medical information is received by the Village from an employee who
is the victim of domestic violence, such medical information shall be kept confidential.
Employees who are victims of domestic violence and who are legally separated from a
covered spouse or civil-union partner shall be allowed to make reasonable changes in
benefits at any time during the calendar year, provided the change is requested within 30
days of the separation and is in accordance with the Village policies, rules, and regulations.
The Village will not make inquiries about a job applicant's current or past domestic violence
victimization, and employment decisions will not be based on any assumptions about or
knowledge of such exposure.
Accountability for employees who are abusers.
The Village will hold employees, individuals who volunteer services to the Village without
remuneration (hereafter "volunteers"), and individuals who contract with the Village or work

for contractors of the Village (hereafter "contractors") accountable for engaging in the
following behavior:
Using Village resources to commit an act of domestic violence;
Committing an act of domestic violence from or at the workplace or from any other
location while on official Village business; or
Using their job-related authority and/or Village resources in order to negatively affect
victims and/or assist perpetrators in locating a victim and/or in perpetrating an act of
domestic violence.
Any physical assault or threat made by an employee, volunteer, or contractor, while on Village
premises, during working hours, while representing the Village, or at a Village-sponsored
event, is a serious violation of this policy. This policy applies not only to acts against
employees, but to acts against all other persons. Those found to have violated this policy will
be subject to corrective or disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
In cases in which the Village has found that an employee, volunteer, or contractor has
threatened, harassed, or abused an intimate partner at the workplace using Village
resources such as work time, workplace telephones, facsimile machines, mail, e-mail or
other means, said employee shall be subject to corrective or disciplinary action.
In cases in which the Village has verification that an employee, volunteer, or contractor is
responsible for a domestic-violence-related offense, or is the subject of any order of
protection, including temporary, final or out-of-state order, as a result of domestic
violence, and said employee, volunteer or contractor has job functions that include the
authority to take actions that directly impact victims of domestic violence and/or actions
that may protect abusers from appropriate consequences for their behavior, the Mayor
shall determine if corrective action is warranted.
In cases in which any employee, volunteer, or contractor intentionally uses his/her jobrelated
authority and/or intentionally uses Village resources in order to negatively impact
a victim of domestic violence, assist an abuser in locating a victim, assist an abuser in
perpetrating acts of domestic violence, or protect an abuser from appropriate
consequences for his/her behavior, said individual may be subject to corrective or
disciplinary action.
Article XXXI. Social Media Policy
§ 97-114. Intent.
It shall be the mission of the Village to ensure its employees maintain professional conduct in their onand
off-work lives. This shall include the image an employee portrays of themselves on the internet
and computer-related media.
§ 97-115. Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to outline the expectations of employees with respect to their use of social

the Village.

Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Foursquare,
The Squad Room, usenet groups, online forums, message boards or bulletin boards, blogs, and other
similarly developed formats, in any way so as to tarnish the Village's reputation. Employees of the
Village are embodiments of our mission. It is vital that each employee accept their role as
ambassadors of the department, striving to maintain public trust and confidence, in not only their
professional actions but also in their personal and online actions. Any online activity that has the effect
of diminishing the public's trust and/or confidence in the Village will hinder the efforts of the Village to
fulfill its mission. Any online actions taken that detract from the mission of the Village, or reflect
negatively on the position of the Village will be viewed as a direct violation of this policy. For police
officers: By virtue of the position of peace officer, they are held to a higher standard than general
members of the public and their online activities should reflect such professional expectations and
standards.

the question under debate, avoiding personalities and refraining from impugning the motives

Chair may briefly explain his ruling; but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other
person shall participate in the discussion. The presiding officer shall have the right to
participate in debate.

personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which his integrity, character, or motives are
assailed, questioned or impugned.

A motion simply to adjourn shall not be subject to amendment or debate, but a motion to
adjourn to a time certain shall be.
The Village Board may, at any time, adjourn over one or more regular meetings on a vote of a
majority of all the Trustees authorized by law to be elected.
Previous question. When the previous question is moved on the main question and seconded, it
shall be put on this form: "Shall the main question now be put?". If such motion is carried, all
further amendments and all further motions and debate shall be excluded and the question put
without delay upon the pending amendment in proper order and then upon the main question.
Motions to lay on the table and to take from the table.
A motion simply to lay the question on the table shall not be debatable, but a motion to lay on
the table and publish, or with any other condition, shall be subject to amendment and debate.
A motion to take any motion or other proposition from the table may be proposed at the same
meeting at which such motion or proposition was laid upon the table, provided 2/3 of the
Trustees vote therefor.
A motion to lay any particular motion or proposition on the table shall apply to that motion or
proposition only. An amendment to the main question or other pending question may be laid
on the table and neither the main question nor such other pending question shall be affected
thereby.
Indefinite postponement; motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time.
When consideration of a motion or other proposition is postponed indefinitely, it shall not be
again taken up at the same meeting.
A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question to debate.
A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall not be construed as a
motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered to be of the same general nature and
to possess the same general attributes so far as applicable under these rules, as a motion to
postpone indefinitely or to a time certain.
Motion to refer. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall take precedence over a similar
motion to refer to a special committee.
Motion to amend.
A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but one to amend an amendment to an
amendment shall not be entertained.
An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in order; but an amendment
relating to a different subject shall not be in order.
On an amendment to "Strike Out and Insert," the paragraph to be amended shall first be read
as it stands, then the words proposed to be stricken out, then those to be inserted, and finally,
the paragraph as it will stand if so amended shall be read.
An amendment to the main question or other pending questions may be referred to a
committee and neither the main question nor such other pending question shall be affected
thereby.
Filling of blanks. When a blank is to be filled and different sums or times proposed, the question
shall be taken first on the least sum or the longest time.

Motion to substitute. A substitute for any original proposition under debate or for any pending
amendment or such proposition may be entertained, notwithstanding that at such time further
amendment is admissible; and if accepted by the Trustees by a vote shall entirely supersede such
original proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut off all amendments appertaining
thereto.
Reconsideration.
A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the same meeting, or at the first
regular meeting held thereafter. A motion for reconsideration having been once made and
decided in the negative shall not be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be
reconsidered.
A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by Trustees who voted on the prevailing
side of the question to be reconsidered, unless otherwise provided by law; provided, however,
that where a motion has received a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely
on the ground that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the passage
or adoption of such motion, then in such case a motion to reconsider may be made and
seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such question to be reconsidered.
Adoption of Robert's Rules of Order Revised. The rules of parliamentary practice comprised in the
latest published edition of Robert's Rules of Order Revised shall govern the Board in all cases to
which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the special rules of the
Board.
Temporary suspension of rules; amendment of rules. These rules may be temporarily suspended
by a vote of 2/3 of the corporate authorities entitled by law to be elected and shall not be repealed,
altered or amended unless by concurrence of 2/3 of all the corporate authorities entitled by law to
be elected.
Censure of Trustees; expulsion of Trustees. Any Trustee acting or appearing in a lewd or
disgraceful manner, or who uses opprobrious, obscene and insulting language to or about any
member of the Board, or who does not obey the order of the Chair shall be, on motion, censured
by a majority vote of the members present, or expelled by a 2/3 vote of all Trustees elected. (65

§ 200-5. Development permits.
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any
development in the floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the administrator. The
administrator shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
Drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions;
Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling;
The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings;
The elevation of the lowest floor (including basements) of all proposed buildings subject to the
requirements of § 200-7 of this chapter; and

estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
Upon receipt of an application for development permit, the administrator shall compare the
elevation of the site to the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be
shown by survey elevation to be below the base flood elevation shall be subject to the
requirements for development in the floodplain. Any development located on land that can be
shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has not been
filled after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in the floodplain and
therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter. In addition, any development located on
land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood source, but
not identified as floodplain on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the provisions of
this chapter.
The administrator shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
The administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other

New and replacement on-site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal systems shall be located
and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
Manholes or other above-ground openings located below the flood protection elevation shall
be watertight.
Construction of new or substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the
limits of the floodplain. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the
floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
floodproofed to the five-hundred-year flood frequency elevation or three feet above the level
of the one-hundred-year flood frequency elevation, whichever is greater. Floodproofing and
sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or
released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood
elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities.
All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as not to alter flood flows or
increase potential flood damages.
§ 200-10. Carrying capacity; notification of alterations or
relocation.
For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the
flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained.
In addition, the Village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of
a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
§ 200-11. Variances.
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific development proposal, the
applicant may apply to the appointed Board of Appeals for a variance. The appointed Board of Appeals
shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Village.
The Village may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
intent of this chapter.
No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions
are met:
The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not granted;
The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or creation of a nuisance;
There will be no additional public expense for flood protection, rescue or relief operations,
policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other public facilities;
The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a pattern inconsistent with the
intent of the NFIP; and
All other state and federal permits have been obtained.

The appointed Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the
requirements of the building protection standards of § 200-7 would lessen the degree of protection
to a building and will:
Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per $100 of insurance
coverage;
Increase the risk to life and property; and
Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that the applicant
acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and liability.
Historic structures. Variances to the building protection requirement of § 200-7 of this chapter
which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or alteration of an historic site or
historic structure as defined in "historic structure" (§ 200-2) may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of § 200-6 and § 200-7 of this chapter, subject to the conditions
that:
The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being removed as a certified historic
structure.
Agriculture.
Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided individually based on a
case-by-case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet
the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for
agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the floodplain management
regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the varied structure is located in wide,
expansive floodplain areas and no other alternate location outside of the special flood
hazard area exists for the agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal
confinement facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural purposes in Zone A only as
identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the exterior and interior
building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior
finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant
materials in accordance with § 200-7 of this chapter.
The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structures in accordance with § 200-7 of this chapter. All of the
building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related
forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base
flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight,
floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in
accordance with § 200-7 of this chapter.

The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the one-hundred-year
flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with § 200-7B of this chapter.
The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
provisions of § 200-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural
structures within any designated floodway.
Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the
floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer or architect prior to the
issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.
§ 200-12. Disclaimer of liability.
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger
floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter
does not imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free from flooding or
damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of the Village or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
§ 200-13. Penalty.
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to comply with the conditions of a
permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the
Mayor may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The Mayor shall
notify the owner in writing of such violation.
If such owner fails, after 10 days' notice, to correct the violation:
The Village shall make application to the Circuit Court for an injunction requiring conformance
with this chapter or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure
compliance with this chapter.
Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not less than $50
nor more than $750 for each offense.
A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation
occurs or continues.
The Village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the property.
The Mayor shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase
flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
The Mayor is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject
development. The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance,
and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work
order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is
held by the Board of Appeals. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee
and shall state:

permit shall be suspended or revoked.
Nothing herein shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy
any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
§ 200-14. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Village to fulfill the requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program, including Ordinance No. 98-1306, adopted August 11, 1998.
However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility
in the Program; nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
§ 200-15. Severability.
The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed severable and the invalidity of any portion
of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the remainder.

Village's actual cost, as determined by the Village, of installing a connection from the main to the
applicant's meter.
Any gas account that is past due for 45 days is subject to disconnection.
§ 209-2. Deposit.
A deposit is required to be paid as a condition for the installation of gas meters. The amount of
deposit shall be set from time to time by the Board of Trustees by resolution.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
This meter deposit charge shall be deposited in the Natural Gas Meter Deposit Fund; and in the
event any customer discontinues service and has paid in full all amounts due for gas or service
charges, then the full amount of the deposit shall be refunded. However, in the event that any
amounts are due from said customer, either for gas or service charges, then such amounts shall
be deducted and paid into the proper fund and the balance shall be refunded.
Any customer who has paid all amounts due within the specified period for a period of two years
shall, upon application to the Village, be refunded his deposit.
§ 209-3. Refusal or discontinuance of service; restoration.
The Village reserves the right, at any time, to refuse any gas tap or service connection with the
natural gas system of the Village whenever the Village Board shall determine that the supply of
natural gas to the Village is insufficient. The Village may elect at any time it deems proper that all
future gas tap or service connection with the natural gas system of the Village shall be on a limited
or restricted basis. The Village, in that event, may issue orders for gas tap or service connection
for space heating. Any person, firm or corporation to whom a restricted order for gas tap or service
connection has been issued is thereby expressly prohibited from using such gas tap or service
connection for space heating.
No customer of the natural gas system of the Village shall install or connect any appliance or
facility to their house piping system, nor shall any customer of the Village make any change in
their existing appliances or facilities, without first securing a written permit from the Village.
The Village reserves the right to discontinue gas service to any premises on account of
nonpayment of charges or where the owner or tenant of such premises has been found guilty of a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. The Village agrees to discontinue gas service to
any premises upon request of the property owner. The Village, in discontinuing gas service, has
the option to remove or shut off the meter to such premises.
A property owner seeking restoration of gas service shall contact the Village as for a new service.
Gas service shall not be restored unless the Village has been paid:
All delinquent gas charges or otherwise provided for payment.
All monthly facility charges while the service was disconnected, but not to exceed 12 months
and a reconnection fee. The reconnection fee if the meter has been removed and the
reconnection fee if the meter has been simply shut off shall be set from time to time by the
Board of Trustees by resolution.

Any increase in the cost of gas charged to the Village by its pipeline supplier may be passed on to all
customer rates for cost recovery. The purchased gas adjustment shall be determined by computing
cost of gas using new rates and historical gas sales in customers to determine the purchased gas
adjustment charge. Changes shall be made immediately upon the pipeline change becoming effective.
In the event that 1) the rates of the pipeline supplier become effective retroactively or 2) for any reason
the Village has been unable to recover charges in the cost of natural gas subsequent to the date of this
chapter, then the amount of any deficiency shall be applied uniformly and directly to the next following
12 months of gas sales or until such time as the deficiency has been recovered, whichever occurs first.
§ 209-5. Authorized rate changes.
The rates for gas services prescribed in this chapter may be changed by the Village at any time and
the Village shall not be deemed to have contracted with any customer to maintain such rates for any
period of time whatever.

The Comptroller is directed to issue receipts for all money received under this chapter and to keep a
record of all monies obtained from the regulation of this chapter in a separate fund and to deposit the
fund in the designated depository for the Village.
§ 209-7. Charges in event of meter failure.
If, at any time, a meter fails to register the quantity of gas, the quantity shall be estimated and then the
charge to be made shall be based on the average quantity registered during the period of time prior to
the date of failure which is reasonable and comparable to the period in which such failure occurs.
§ 209-8. Utility billing procedures.
The provisions of Chapter 318, Utilities, and the administrative and billing procedures contained in
Articles I and II shall be applicable to the gas distribution system.
In regard to § 318-5H, the following shall be applicable, with the following addition thereto:
Notwithstanding a decision of the hearing officer, service may not be terminated on any day when
the official Weather Bureau forecast is for a temperature below 20° F. for the next 24 hours.
Neither may the service be shut off the day before a holiday or weekend when the official forecast
calls for a temperature below 20° F.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 209-9. Charges for gas usage.
There shall be and there are hereby established monthly rates and charges for the sale of natural gas
and for the use and service supplied by the natural gas distribution system of the Village, based upon
the amount of gas consumed as shown by the gas meters.
Rates and charges. The gas rates and charges are as follows:
Gas rates shall be based on the actual per-therm cost charged to the Village plus operating
expenses and replacement cost, with a minimum per month base rate of $3.

above rates. Those items are identified as follows:
Gas charge. The foregoing and any other rates shall be adjusted on each billing based
on the actual cost to the Village. The result shall be known as the "gas charge."
Operating expense adjustment. Any changes in operating expenses (in addition to
changes in cost of gas and taxes) shall be passed uniformly and directly to all bills
rendered after such determination has been made by audit or by the Board of Trustees.
The determination shall be made by using the latest fiscal audit report with the "base
operating expenses" being those operating expenses. Changes in operating expenses
shall be limited to the following:
Demonstrated changes identified in the fiscal reports of the Village.
Changes in wages, salaries, payroll or payroll expenses applicable after they have

No person shall, in any manner, obstruct or permit or cause to be obstructed the free access of any
officer or employee of the Village to any valve meter, shut-off box, or connection with any gas main or
service pipe by means of any coal, lumber, brick, building material, or by any other means or device
whatever, or refuse or prevent free access thereto by such officer or employee whenever such officer
or employee shall desire access thereto in the performance of his duties. The officers of the Village
and any and every person delegated or authorized by the Village for such purpose shall have free
access to all and any part of any building, structure, or for examining the taps, pipes, and fixtures
therein. Any person in possession, charge, or control of any such building, structure, or premises onto
which such officer or employee shall desire to make entry or to have access for the purpose herein
specified, who shall refuse to permit such entry or access, or who shall do or cause to be done any act
or thing for the purpose of preventing such entry or access, shall be deemed to be guilty of a violation
of this chapter and shall be punished as herein provided.
§ 209-14. Enforcement by Superintendent.
The Superintendent of the Gas System shall enforce the provisions of this chapter and shall, in the
name of the Village, receive applications for gas supply or service and issue permits therefor as
provided herein.
§ 209-15. Tap-in connections; exclusive control of Village.
Taps and connections to mains or any part or portion of the Village's natural gas transmission line and
distribution system shall be made only by the Village and shall be made in accordance with such
reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Village. The letting of gas to and the
turning off of gas from all buildings, structures or premises and into and from all connections and
service shall be under the exclusive control of the Village and no plumber or other person shall let gas
to or from any service or connection for any purpose whatever without permission therefor. (See § 209-
29.)
§ 209-16. Separate meters required.
No person, firm or corporation shall connect any gas service line or transmit gas supplied by the
natural gas system of the Village into more than one distinct building from one meter. A garage or
similar outbuilding shall be considered a distinct building. Apartment buildings having separate dwelling
units may be serviced from a single meter. Duplex dwellings shall be served from individual meters.
The Board of Trustees shall have the right to establish special services or service connections as may
be necessary for large users.
§ 209-17. Damage to meters and other equipment.
All meters, pipes and other equipment which are installed by the Village shall be and remain the
property of the Village and consumers using the same shall be responsible for the safekeeping thereof.
If any meter, pipe, or other equipment which is installed by the Village shall be damaged or destroyed
by any cause which could have been prevented by the exercising of ordinary care and caution, the
cost of repairing or replacing the same shall be charged to and paid by the consumer responsible
therefor.
§ 209-18. Availability of supply.
If, at any time and for any reason, the volume of gas available for delivery by the Village is not
adequate to supply all the demands on the Village, the Village shall have the right, upon such

notice as is reasonable under the circumstances, to reduce or discontinue the delivery of gas; first,
to its medium commercial users; next, to its small commercial users; and finally, to its residential
users. Such reduction or discontinuance, as the case may be, shall continue as long as such
shortage of supply exists. Notice of reduction or discontinuance of delivery shall be given to users
on a reasonably nondiscriminatory bases. Whenever notice is given by the Village to any user to
reduce or discontinue his use of gas, he, such consumer, shall comply therewith until he, such
consumer, is notified by the Village that such shortage no longer exists. If any user fails to reduce
his use of gas in compliance with any notice to him to do so, the Village may completely
discontinue supplying gas to him while such shortage continues.
For the purpose of this section, but not as a limitation thereof, the Village's supply of gas shall be
deemed to be inadequate if and to the extent that the total demands on it exceed the Village's
contract demand under its contract with its supplier.
§ 209-19. Village not liable for interruption of service or supply.
The Village shall have the right to shut off the supply of gas whenever it is necessary to make
repairs, improvements, enforce rules or for any operating reason. In all cases where possible, a
reasonable notice of the circumstances will be given to the customer, but in an emergency or
discovery of an unsafe condition, the gas may be shut off without notice. Such necessary repairs
or work will be made by the Village as rapidly as may be practical. The Village shall not be held
responsible or liable because of any shutoff or discontinuance of service for any direct or resultant
damages to any person, company or customer.
In the event of such discontinuance of gas service, the Village will make every attempt to
safeguard the customer and service shall not be renewed until the Village authorities have purged
the lines and put into service all automatic controls and pilots. The cost of purging of lines,
relighting pilots, and checking automatic controls will be borne by the Village and the customer will
not be liable for any portion thereof. Where the nature of the customer's operations are not such
that an interruption of service might create a hazard or large economic loss, such customer shall
provide facilities for standby service if desired.
Whenever mains, pipes, service connections or other facilities of the gas system are taken up,
shut off or interfered with by reasons of any Village street improvement, the Village will endeavor
to maintain service so far as is reasonably possible, but will not be directly or indirectly liable for
any interruption, poor pressure or damage of any kind, either to the customer adjacent or to other
customers affected thereby. Direct damage to property due to such operations shall be either
repaired or replaced by the Village without cost to the consumer.
The Village expressly stipulates with all customers and other persons who may be affected by the
discontinuance of service that it will neither insure nor be responsible or liable in any manner for

All persons are strictly forbidden to attach any electrical ground wire to any fixture or piping which
is or may be connected to any gas service pipe, meter, or main belonging to the Village. The
Village will hold the owner of the premises responsible and liable for any damage to its property or
injury to the employees of the Village caused by such ground wire. All persons shall remove any
existing ground wires immediately and if such ground wires are not removed after 24 hours'
written notice, the Village, through its officials, may enter the property and remove such ground
wires and the customer shall pay all costs. All questions and complaints shall be made in writing to
the Gas Department of the Village for proper investigation. The Department shall make a report to
the Village Clerk who, in turn, shall report to the Board of Trustees at the next regular meeting. All
employees of the Village are strictly forbidden to demand or accept any tips, gratuity or other
personal compensation for any service whatsoever which is rendered during working hours.
Any customer-owned lines which are required to be operated and maintained by the Village shall
be subject to a monthly charge covering such operation and maintenance. Said charge shall be an
additional monthly amount equal to the facility and gas charge at the time of billing.
§ 209-21. Piping, facilities, appliances and venting.
The responsibility of the Village for maintenance and safety of natural gas piping terminates at the
outlet of the meter, except for residential customers where the meter is located more than three
feet from the outside residential wall in accordance with Illinois law.
All house or mobile home piping shall be of rigid construction. The pipe from the outlet of the
meter shall be black iron not less than one inch inside diameter and shall enter the outside vertical
house wall or mobile home skirt. The pipe shall be secured or anchored by means of a suitable
metal strap or clamp at a point not more than 18 inches from the meter outlet and shall be
fastened to the wall at intervals sufficient to make the pipe rigid throughout. All piping from the
meter shall be securely fastened so that the pipe will not turn when fittings are installed at or near
the meter. The final tie-in of the gas line to the meter shall be made by the Village.
Gas will not be turned on to any customer manifold that has not been first air tested for
leakage at one psig or more by the applicant or his agent and subsequently checked by the
Village. Testing must be done as a completed system. No partial or temporary service is
permitted. All tests shall be held for observation by the Village gas employee.
Customer connections between the meter and the outside residential wall are prohibited,
except for individual lines to serve gas grills or gas lights.
The Village does herewith adopt as its rules and regulations the safety practices set forth by the
National Fire Protection Association in the latest revision of the National Fuel Gas Code, NFPA 54,
as though those provisions were fully repeated and set forth herein so far as they are not
inconsistent with this chapter. In the event of conflict, the more restrictive language shall apply.
NFPA 54 is the National Fuel Gas Code. Any person, firm or corporation installing fuel gas piping
or appliances within the gas service area of the Village shall avail themselves of said Fuel Gas
Code prior to the undertaking of any such installation and shall follow it.
No surface may be constructed or placed over a gas service line or main which may produce a
seal to a building wall or foundation or which may obstruct ready access for repair or replacement.
All buried natural gas piping facilities owned or served by the Village and distribution
appurtenances shall conform to the latest revision of NFPA 54 and the Minimum Federal Pipeline
Safety Standards, 49 CFR Part 192, as though fully set forth herein. The minimum standards shall
apply equally to private buried facilities and distribution appurtenances. No natural gas piping may
be placed or remain beneath any building or sealed surface except in a specified vented casing.
No meter, regulator, or any part of a meter Village-owned setting may be painted or otherwise
coated by a customer without written approval of the Utilities Superintendent on a case-by-case

basis. Special coatings are required to prevent shorting of insulators.
The Village shall not "approve" customer piping, which as used herein means piping beyond the
outlet of the meter. The Village may refuse connection or discontinue service upon discovering
any conditions which may be in violation of this chapter or which may create any type of safety
hazard, including venting.
Heating plants and water heaters shall be connected to gas piping, except where an AGA-listed
flexible connector is furnished by the manufacturer as part of its installation design. AGA-approved
appliance connectors may be used only on ranges, clothes dryers or built-in ovens. Sweat fitting
shall not be used anywhere in the gas piping.
All gas conversion burners to be installed shall be AGA-listed and approved. All designed heating
plants shall be AGA-listed and approved and the manufacturer's recommendations for the
installation shall be followed. No conversion burner shall be installed in an old or ineffective
furnace or a boiler which is in poor repair. Test for leakage shall be conducted by the installer in an
approved manner before placing a conversion burner in a warm-air heating plant.
No alteration, repair, adjustment, customer relighting, any applicant work or piping work shall be
done by Village forces beyond the outlet of the meter, except to the extent that it may be required
for purposes of safety only. This prohibition shall apply to L.P. conversions.
No unvented gas appliances, except kitchen ranges, clothes dryers and refrigerators, may be
installed or operated within the Village. Safety shut-off devices to protect either supply gas or
venting failure shall be installed and subsequently tested for proper operation by the installer.
Written documentation of the test may be requested. These devices shall be used when approved
for or furnished with new heating equipment.
Decorative or supplementary appliances shall be properly vented in accordance with NFPA 54.
These include but are not limited to gas logs and gas log lighters. At any time such units are
installed in wood-burning fireplaces, special action must be taken for permanent modification of
the flue damper. Positive assurance must be provided that the damper cannot be fully closed. A
permanent hole must be cut or a positive stop attached, even if the unit has a safety pilot. The size
of this opening shall be in accordance with the table in NFPA 54 titled "Free Opening Area of
Chimney Damper for Venting Flue Gases from Unlisted Decorative Appliances for Installation in
Vented Fireplaces." All other provisions for safety must be observed.
The Village shall be notified of any changes or alterations, remodeling or reconstruction affecting
gas piping in any building, house or grounds. This shall be done using a new application for gas
service or by amending an existing application.
§ 209-22. Rules to become part of contract.
All the rules and regulations concerning the use of the facilities of the natural gas system of the Village
and the consumption of gas therefrom shall become a part of the contract with every gas customer,
and every gas customer shall be subject thereto and bound thereby.
§ 209-23. Extension of gas mains and service.
The Village shall not be required to extend service within the Village limits a distance of more than
100 feet per customer and only then when sufficient funds are available in excess of those
required for the proper operation of the system. Extension of mains and service outside of the
Village limits shall be subject to approval of the Board and shall also be subject to all of the rules
and regulations and provisions as provided herein or as may be amended. All mains, lines and
equipment shall immediately become the property of the Village.

Where service is desired when funds for extensions are not available and/or when the distance is
in excess of the 100 feet per customer noted above, such extension can be made if the applicant
will deposit with the Village the estimated cost of making the extension, less 100 feet when funds
are available, or the entire amount when the funds are not available. The amounts so deposited
shall be refunded to such consumer or consumers at the rate of $0.90 per Mcf. annually until the
total deposit has been refunded or until eight annual payments have been made, whichever event
occurs first. Such deposit shall be interest-free. In the event that the amount deposited is greater
or less than the actual cost of the extension, such excess or deficiency shall be corrected prior to
giving service.
Deposits made under the provisions of this section shall not exempt the application from the
payment of all other charges required by this chapter.
Amounts received by the Village for such extensions shall be deposited in the Meter Deposit
Fund and payments for refunds shall likewise be paid from the same fund.
§ 209-24. Tampering with system prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or customer to break the seal of any meter or
in any manner to make any alterations, changes or repairs on the same or to open any mains,
laterals, service pipe, stopcocks, valves, or any part thereof or otherwise tamper with or attempt to
do any work on either or any of them without written authority of the Village, or its properly
authorized agent. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this section, or who shall
willfully or maliciously injure or damage any property connected with the gas system of the Village,
shall be subject to the penalty hereinafter prescribed.
No customer shall be permitted to use the stop cock of the service connection for shutting off gas
while making extensions, additions or repairs to the pipe or equipment on the premises. Such
shut-off or discontinuance or interruption of service shall be made only by properly authorized
employees of the Village.
Tampering shall include any type of confinement, enclosure, covering over, surface sealing or
changing of the environment relative to any parts of the gas system or equipment of the Village.
Such tampering shall become the liability of the customer, who shall pay the Village the actual cost
of removal, repairing and/or replacing equipment or material.
§ 209-25. Transfer of gas service.
Gas service may not be transferred from one premises to another by any user. The availability of
service at any location is dependent upon the availability of natural gas in the Village and its rules in
effect at the time of a request for service at any premises.
§ 209-26. Gas and Water Committee.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]

§ 231-53. Complaints by residents.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Any five residents of the municipality shall have the right to file a complaint with the Mayor stating
that a licensee under this chapter has been or is violating the provisions of this chapter or any
amendments hereto, or of any of the statutes of the State of Illinois, enacted with reference to the
control of liquor. Such complaint shall be made in writing and shall be signed and sworn to by the
parties complaining.
The complaint shall state the particular provision, rule or regulation believed to have been violated
and the facts in detail upon which such belief is based. If the Mayor is satisfied that the complaint
substantially charges a violation, and that from the facts alleged there is reasonable cause for
such belief, he shall set the matter for hearing, and shall serve notice upon the licensee of the time
and place of such hearing and of the particular charges in the complaint.
(See 235 ILCS 5/7-7.)
§ 231-54. Revocation or suspension of local license; notice and
hearing.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
The Mayor may revoke or suspend any license issued by him if he determines that the licensee has
violated any of the provisions of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, any valid ordinance adopted by the
municipality, or any applicable rule or regulation established by the Mayor or the State Commission
which is not inconsistent with law.
Fine as opposed to suspension or revocation. In addition to the suspension, the Mayor may levy a
fine on the licensee for such violations. The fine imposed shall not exceed $1,000 for a first
violation within a twelve-month period, $1,500 for a second violation within a twelve-month period,
and $2,500 for a third or subsequent violation within a twelve-month period. Each day on which a
violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. Not more than $15,000 in fines under this
section may be imposed against any licensee during the period of his license. Proceeds from such
fines shall be paid into the general corporate fund of the municipal treasury. (See P.A. 89-0063.)
Revocation and suspension; notice. However, no such license shall be so revoked or suspended
and no licensee shall be fined except after a public hearing by the Mayor with a three-day written
notice to the licensee affording the licensee an opportunity to appear and defend. All such
hearings shall be open to the public and the Mayor shall reduce all evidence to writing and shall
maintain an official record of the proceedings. If the Mayor has reason to believe that any
continued operation of a particular licensed premises will immediately threaten the welfare of the
community he may, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for such conclusion
and without notice or hearing, order the licensed premises closed for not more than seven days,
giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard during that period; except that if such licensee shall
also be engaged in the conduct of another business or businesses on the licensed premises, such
order shall not be applicable to such other business or businesses.
Hearing. The Mayor shall, within five days after such hearing, if he determines after such hearing
that the license should be revoked or suspended, state the reason or reasons for such
determination in a written order of revocation or suspension and shall serve a copy of such order
within the five days upon the license. The findings of the Mayor shall be predicated upon
competent evidence.

§ 231-56. Appeals in event of multiple violations.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
In any case in which a licensee appeals to the State Commission a suspension or revocation by
the Mayor that is the second or subsequent such suspension or revocation placed on that licensee
within the preceding twelve-month period, the licensee shall consider the suspension or revocation
to be in effect until a reversal of the Mayor's action has been issued by the State Commission and
shall cease all activity otherwise authorized by the license. The State Commission shall expedite,
to the greatest extent possible, its consideration of any appeal that is an appeal of a second or
subsequent suspension or revocation within the past twelve-month period.
Any appeal of the decision and findings of the Mayor in Subsection A shall be limited to a review
of the official record of the proceedings of said Mayor. The official record shall be a "certified
official record" of the proceedings taken and prepared by a certified court reporter or certified
shorthand reporter. A copy of this record shall be filed by the Mayor within five days after notice of
the filing of such appeal is received by the municipality from State Commission.

a defined enclosed area (roof not required). The application for an adjacent premises facility shall be
on a form provided by the Village Clerk and shall, in writing:
State the hours during which liquor is to be sold;
Describe the physical improvements to be made by the applicant to ensure that minors shall not

freely and fully consented to the development of such a facility.
§ 231-58. Causes for denial.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
The Mayor may refuse to approve the application for an adjacent premises facility as provided for
herein if it is found that:
Any provision of state law, local ordinance or other duly adopted rule or regulation relating to the
licensing or sale of alcoholic liquor at retail, other than those provisions which would be in direct
conflict with the provisions herein relating to the application, would be violated;
To grant the application would pose any threat to public safety or would likely create a public
nuisance; or
The improvements proposed by the licensee to ensure the protection of minors are not adequate
to reasonably ensure such protection.
§ 231-59. Conditions of approval.
An application for an adjacent premises facility, if approved, may be conditioned upon the
applicant enforcing certain conditions, including, but not limited to, those imposed for the
protection of minors. Whenever deemed appropriate by the Mayor, the failure of a licensee to
enforce such imposed conditions may constitute grounds to suspend or revoke the liquor license
of the licensee duly issued by the Village for the establishment adjacent to the premises regulated
under this article.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
The following is a list of conditions with respect to an adjacent premises facility with respect to

Obscene defined. Any material or performance is obscene if:
The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that,
taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and
The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it
depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic
sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory
functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and
Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
Interpretation of evidence.
Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with
reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character
of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or
directed to such an audience.
Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity
indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such
evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion
that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence shall be admissible to show:
The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was
directed;
What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special
audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people;
The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or the absence
thereof;
The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state;
Appeal to prurient interest or absence thereof in advertising or other promotion of the
material;
The purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.
Permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer an intent to disseminate from the creation,
purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of
obscenity, specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies; or the possession of more than three
copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to disseminate.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination:
[Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under 18 years of
age;
Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession
of such material.

§ 260-95. Harmful material.
Elements of the offense. A person who, with knowledge that a person is a child, that is, a person
under 18 years of age, or who fails to exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a
child, knowingly distributes to, or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to or offers to distribute
or exhibit any harmful material to a child is guilty of a violation of this chapter.
Interpretation of terms; definitions.
Material is harmful if, to the average person applying contemporary standards, its
predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest; that is, shameful or morbid
interest in nudity, sex, or excretion which goes substantially beyond customary limits of
candor in description or representation of such matters and is material, the redeeming social
importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
DISTRIBUTE
To transfer possession of material, whether with or without consideration.
KNOWINGLY
Having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the contents thereof.
MATERIAL
Any writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment.
Interpretation of evidence.
The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall be judged with reference to
average children of the same general age of the child to whom such material was offered,
distributed, sent or exhibited unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the
circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for specially
susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the material shall be judged with
reference to its intended or probable recipient group.
In prosecutions under this section where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate the material is being commercially exploited
for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is,
in fact, substantially less than its prurient appeal.
Affirmative defenses.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any library operated by an accredited
institution of higher education from circulating harmful material to any person under 18 years
of age, provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational purpose, and
it shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that the act
charged was committed in aid of legitimate scientific or educational purposes.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from distributing to his child any harmful
material.
Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance upon any of the
following documents as proof of the age of a child shall be a defense to any criminal
prosecution under this section: a document issued by the federal government or any state,
county or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited

to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal
Selective Service Act or an identification card issued to a member of the Armed Forces.
In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in this section culminates in the
sale or distribution of such harmful material to a child, under circumstances where there was
no personal confrontation of the child by the defendant, his employees or agents, as where
the order or request for such harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone, or similar
means of communication, and delivery of such harmful material to the child was by mail,
freight, or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any prosecution for a violation of
this section that the advertisement contained the following statement or a statement
substantially similar thereto, and that the defendant required the purchaser to certify that he
was not under the age of 18 years and that the purchaser falsely stated that he was not under
the age of 18 years:
"NOTICE: It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to purchase the matter herein
advertised. Any person under 18 years of age who falsely states that he is not under 18 years
of age for the purpose of obtaining the material advertised herein is guilty of a misdemeanor."
Child falsifying age. Any person under 18 years of age who falsely states, either orally or in
writing, that he is not under the age of 18 years, or who presents or offers to any person any
evidence of age and identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of ordering,
obtaining, viewing or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view any harmful material is
guilty of a misdemeanor.
(65 ILCS 5/11-5-1; 720 ILCS 5/11-21)
§ 260-96. Tie-in sales of obscene publications to distributors.
Any person, firm or corporation or any agent, officer or employee thereof engaged in the business of
distributing books, magazines, periodicals, comic books or other publications to retail dealers who shall
refuse to furnish to any retail dealer such quantity of books, magazines, periodicals, comic books or
other publications as such retail dealer normally sells because the retail dealer refuses to sell, or offer
for sale, any books, magazines, periodicals, comic books or other publications which are obscene,
lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent is guilty of an offense. Each publication sold or delivered in violation

Chapter 291. Stormwater Management
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Westville as Ch. 32 of the 2015 Code.
Amendments noted where applicable.]
Article I. General Provisions
§ 291-1. Authority and purpose.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the Village by the Illinois
Compiled Statutes, 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-5, 5/11-30-8, 5/11-109-1, and 5/11-107-1.
The purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to public health and safety, protect property,
prevent damage to the environment and promote public welfare by guiding, regulating and
controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any new development or
redevelopment or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the
movement of earth, and/or changes the stormwater drainage pattern and/or stormwater flows from
that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural state. This stormwater runoff
and resulting soil erosion could result in the inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and
destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources.
This chapter regulates these activities to minimize adverse impacts.
The purpose of this chapter is also to comply with the General National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. ILR40 regulations, the notice of intent (NOI) submitted to
the IEPA in 2003.
This chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives:
To assure that new development or redevelopment does not increase the drainage or flood
hazards, or create unstable conditions susceptible to soil erosion;
To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to
increased stormwater runoff and soil erosion;
To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding and soil erosion on a
watershed basis;
To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged
public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and
relief operations caused by stormwater runoff and soil erosion quantities from new
development or redevelopment;
To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and soil, water, air, animal,
and plant resources;
To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains
and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats;
To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to manage flood and
stormwater impacts, improve water and groundwater quality, reduce soil erosion, protect
aquatic and riparian habitat, maintain quality forest resources, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits, enhance community and economic development.

MODIFIED RATIONAL METHOD
As described in the Illinois Department of Transportation "Drainage Manual," is based on the
principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area occurs at that point in time
when all parts of the watershed are contributing to the flow. The rainfall generating the peak flow is
assumed to be of uniform intensity for the entire watershed with a rainfall duration equal to the
time of concentration.

pasture, woodland, or other land, but it is not urban and built-up land or water areas. It is either
used for food or fiber or is available for those uses. The soil qualities, growing season and
moisture supply are those needed for a well-managed soil to economically produce a sustained
high yield of crops. Prime farmland produces the highest yields with minimum inputs of energy and
economic resources, and farming it results in the least damage to the environment.

For that portion of the watershed outside of an owner's land, the peak rate of runoff which
would have occurred for a five-year return period storm under the state of development
existing just prior to application for development of an owner's land shall be calculated and
determined.
For that portion of the watershed within the lands of an owner, the peak rate of runoff which
would have occurred for a five-year return period storm under a state of traditional agricultural
usage shall be calculated and determined.
The maximum controlled release rate for each independent watershed area within the
owner's land as it exits the owner's land for storms up to and including the fifty-year return
period storm shall be the sum of Subsections A(1) and A(2) of this section.
The peak rate of runoff which would have occurred for a five-year return period storm shall be
determined using the Rational Method or other substantial method acceptable to the Village
Engineer.
The five-year and fifty-year storm shall be determined utilizing Bulletin 70 of the Illinois State
Water Survey, or the most recently available information.
In the event that the downstream stormwater runoff drainage system is inadequate to
accommodate the maximum release rate provided above, then the Village, at its option, may
reduce the allowable release rate to that rate permitted by the capacity of the receiving
stormwater runoff drainage system and additional storage, as determined by the Village
Engineer, may be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the
receiving stormwater runoff drainage system.
Storm sewer systems.
Compliance is mandatory with the latest edition of the Standard Specifications for Water and
Sewer Main Construction in Illinois.
Capacity. All storm sewer systems shall be designed for the peak rate of runoff from a
minimum of a five-year return period storm in accordance with the Illinois Department of
Transportation Drainage Manual. The five-year return period storm shall be determined
utilizing Bulletin 70 of the Illinois State Water Survey, or the most recently available
information. The minimum pipe diameter shall be 12 inches. The system shall have a free
outlet.
All design calculations must be submitted to the Village Engineer for approval.
Grade. Sewer grades shall be such that, in general, a minimum of two feet of cover is
maintained over the top of the pipe. Pipe cover less than the minimum may be used upon
site-specific approval by the Village Engineer. Uniform slopes shall be maintained between
inlets, manholes and inlet to manhole. Minimum and maximum allowable slopes shall be
those capable of producing velocities between two feet per second and 10 feet per second,
with three feet per second being desirable, when the sewer is flowing full as calculated by
Manning's Formula. Velocities lower than the minimum or higher than the maximum may be
used upon site-specific approval by the Village Engineer.
Overland flow. The maximum distance for overland flow of stormwater runoff to an
underground storm sewer system shall be 600 feet.
Alignment. Storm sewers shall be constructed in a straight line between manholes insofar as
possible. Where long-radius curves are necessary to conform to street layout, the minimum
radius of curvature shall be no less than 100 feet. Deflection of pipe sections shall not exceed
the maximum deflection recommended by the pipe manufacturer. The deflection shall be
uniform and the finished installation shall follow a smooth curve.

storm sewer structure shall be prohibited, except with approved conflict structures.
Surface drainage systems. Surface drainage will be permitted for stormwater, where cost
estimates show storm sewers are not economically feasible (including all life-cycle costs and the
value of the land consumed), where land use conditions indicate this method is feasible, and
where topographic conditions indicate there will be no difficulty from this method of disposal of
stormwaters. Such economic and feasibility studies shall be reviewed and approved by the Village
Engineer.
Capacity. All surface drainage systems of stormwater shall be designed for the peak rate of
runoff from a minimum of a ten-year return period storm. The ten-year return period storm
shall be determined utilizing Bulletin 70 of the Illinois State Water Survey, or the most recently
available information. The system shall have a free outlet. All design calculations must be
submitted to the Village Engineer for approval.
Grade. Stormwater surface drains shall be constructed with uniform bottom slopes along the
entire length of the drains. Minimum and maximum allowable grade shall be those capable of
producing velocities between 0.5 foot per second and 10.0 feet per second, respectively,
when the surface drain is flowing full. A minimum slope of 0.3% is required. In all cases,
stormwater velocity shall be controlled to eliminate problems of soil erosion or other damage
which could detract from the primary use of the area.
Side slopes and bottom widths. Surface drains shall be constructed having side slopes of not
less than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, or flatter. Side slopes steeper than three
feet horizontal to one foot vertical shall not be used without site-specific approval by the
Village Engineer. A channel bottom width of not less than two feet shall be provided.
Erosion. Design of surface drains shall include control of soil erosion. Temporary seeding or
other soil stabilization measures shall be utilized during construction to control erosion.
Permanent erosion control measures such as mulching, hydroseeding, conventional seeding,
or other similar measures shall be utilized upon completion of construction. At the discretion
of the Village Engineer, energy dissipaters, such as riprap, may be required at storm inlet and
outlet locations. Erosion control practices identified in this chapter shall be constructed in
accordance with the Illinois Urban Manual, 1995.
Culverts. Culverts and similar structures shall have a capacity which meets or exceeds the
capacity of the surface drain, but shall be a minimum of 12 inches in diameter. The flowline of
a culvert shall match the flowline of the surface drain. All culverts shall have flared end
sections or headwall treatments. Culvert materials shall be in accordance with the Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Illinois Department of Transportation (latest
edition).
Workmanship. The specifications for the construction of stormwater surface drains shall equal
or exceed those set forth in the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
Illinois Department of Transportation (latest edition) or shall be as otherwise approved by the
Village Engineer.
Tile drains. All major stormwater surface drains as designated by the Village Engineer shall
also be constructed with a subsurface drainage tile or tubing encased to the surface with
washed gravel in a nonwoven geotextile envelope.
Excess stormwater passageway.
An excess stormwater passageway shall be provided for the floodplains of all natural
watercourses and such man-made watercourses and storm drainage systems as the Village
Engineer may direct, which shall have adequate capacity to convey the excess stormwater
from the tributary watershed. The capacity of this excess stormwater passageway shall be

adequate to transport the peak rate of runoff from the fifty-year return period storm, assuming
all upstream areas are fully developed for uses specifically permitted by existing zoning.
Emergency overflow routes shall be located in permanent easements, dedicated commons,
or on public rights-of-way. Routes shall be designated on the face of the preliminary plat and
subsequent plans. No structures shall be constructed within this passageway; however,
streets, parking lots, playgrounds, park areas, pedestrian walkways, open green space, and
utility and sewer easements shall be considered compatible uses.
Design of the excess stormwater passageway shall include control of stormwater velocity to
eliminate problems of soil erosion or other damage which would detract from the primary use
of the area. The entire area of any excess stormwater passageway within the corporate limits
of the Village and 1 1/2 miles thereof shall be placed in a drainage easement or remain under
the jurisdiction of the Village, other governmental unit, or Village-approved quasi-public
agency (i.e., homeowner's association, etc.). In the event this passageway is reshaped or its
capacity to transport excess stormwater is otherwise restricted, the Village may cause to have
any restrictions removed at the expense of the agency, party, or parties causing or permitting
these restrictions. Should a natural drain exist, it shall be preserved and used to the extent
possible, as a part of the excess stormwater passageway. Where it is necessary to reroute a
natural drain, the rerouted drain shall have a capacity equivalent to or greater than that which
existed in the natural drain and as otherwise required by this chapter.
Stormwater storage. When the maximum controlled stormwater runoff rate would be exceeded
due to the development, redevelopment, or new construction on the owner's land, stormwater
storage methods shall be provided and constructed by the owner. Any one or all of the stormwater
storage methods listed shall be provided and constructed.
General requirements.
The volume of required stormwater storage shall be calculated on the basis of the
maximum value achieved from the runoff of a fifty-year return period storm less the
volume of water released through the outlet structure. The fifty-year return period storm
shall be determined utilizing Bulletin 70 of the Illinois Water Survey, or the most recently
available information. The method utilized for calculation of volume of storage shall be
the rational method or any other substantial method acceptable to the Village Engineer.
The release rate of the outlet structure when 1/2 of the storage volume is filled may be
used in lieu of routing techniques in small drainage areas. The control structure shall be
designed to maintain as uniform a flow as possible, independent of the stormwater
storage volume. Where the proposed structure, project, or land development forms only a
portion of a watershed or contains portions of several watersheds, the storage volume
calculations shall be based upon the area of the entire project, development, or land use
change.
The storage of excess stormwater runoff from a fifty-year return period storm having a
duration of 24 hours, released at the allowable rate, shall not result in a storage duration
in excess of 24 hours, but storage duration may be as long as 48 hours upon site-specific
approval by the Village Engineer.
All design calculations must be submitted to the Village Engineer for approval.
Plans shall clearly indicate normal and high water elevations, design storage volume,
minimum, maximum and typical slopes.
Each stormwater storage area shall be provided with a method of overflow in the event a
storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. This overflow facility shall be constructed
to function without special attention and can become a part of the excess stormwater
passageway described in Subsection D of this section.

The entire stormwater storage area shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the
public health, safety, and welfare. If a condition occurs in the stormwater storage area
which is hazardous to the public health, safety, or welfare, the person responsible for the
condition will be required to provide approved corrective measures. In the event these
corrective measures are not provided, the Village may eliminate the hazard at the
expense of the person responsible.
Detention basins and their fifty-year high water shall be contained within platted lots
dedicated for drainage purposes. Said lots shall have a minimum thirty-foot street
frontage at a minimum of two locations. For infill redevelopment, detention basins and
their fifty-year high water shall be contained within a drainage easement with thirty-foot
public roadway frontage where possible. All detention basins shall include the following
design parameters:
A twenty-foot minimum setback from all property lines to the normal pool elevation.
A minimum of one foot of freeboard above the one-hundred-year design water
elevation.
Any buildings within 100 feet of a detention basin shall have the lowest water entry
point a minimum of two feet above the one-hundred-year design water elevation.
Dry bottom stormwater storage.
Dry bottom stormwater storage areas may be designed to serve a secondary purpose for
recreation, open space, or similar types of uses which will not be adversely affected by
occasional intermittent flooding;
Minimum grades for turf areas shall be 0.5% (200 units horizontal to one unit vertical),
and maximum side slopes shall be 25% (four units horizontal to one unit vertical).
Storage area side slopes shall follow the natural land contours as closely as practicable,
and a minimum of earth excavation shall be used to create the storage facility.
Geometrics of dry bottom stormwater storage areas shall be approved by the Village
Engineer.
Erosion control measures.
Temporary seeding or other soil stabilization measures shall be established in the
stormwater storage area and excess stormwater passageway immediately following
the construction or reconstruction of these areas. During the construction of the
overall development, it is recognized that a limited amount of sediment buildup may
occur in the stormwater storage area due to erosion. In no case shall the volume of
the storage area be reduced to less than 90% of the required volume during the
construction phase of the development.
Permanent erosion control measures such as mulching, hydroseeding, conventional
seeding, fertilizing, or sod installation shall be utilized to control soil movement and
erosion within the storage area and excess stormwater passageway. These
measures shall meet or exceed the standards established by the Illinois Urban
Manual, 1995. The installation of these permanent measures shall take place only
after the majority of construction and other silt- and sediment-producing activities
have been completed. Prior to the establishment of the permanent erosion control
measures, the required capacity of the stormwater storage area and the excess
stormwater passageway shall be restored.
The control structure shall be provided with an interceptor for trash and debris, and it
shall be designed and constructed to prevent soil erosion and not to require manual
adjustments for its proper operation. The control structure shall be designed to operate
properly with little or no maintenance and/or attention. The control structure shall be

provided with safety screens for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals
from crawling into structures. The control structure shall be constructed to allow access
to it at all times, including times of flood flow.
Adequate impact stilling basins shall be provided to ensure that downstream soil erosion
is mitigated as much as practical and the regime of the downstream drain facility is not
disturbed.
Low-flow conduits or channels shall be provided in stormwater storage areas; these
conduits or channels shall be so constructed that they will not interfere with any
secondary usage of the storage area and will reduce the frequency of time that the
storage area will be covered with water. Low-flow conduits shall facilitate complete
interior drainage of the stormwater storage area.
Pipe outlets of less than six inches in diameter shall not be allowed. Pipe outlets shall not
exceed 100 feet in length. Multiple outlets from a storm storage area shall be avoided if
they are designed to be less than 12 inches in diameter.
The maximum planned depth of stormwater stored shall not exceed four feet.
Tile underdrains shall be provided in dry bottom stormwater storage areas in accordance
with Subsection C(7) of this section. These tile underdrains shall be so constructed that
they will not interfere with any secondary usage of the storage area. Tile underdrains
shall be so constructed that they shall facilitate dewatering of the soils in the stormwater
storage area to avoid marshy or saturated soil conditions. Tile underdrain systems may
be combined with the low-flow conduits or channel systems and shall be as approved by
the Village Engineer.
Fencing may be required whenever storage depths exceed four feet, or when side slopes
are greater than four horizontal to one vertical.
Wet bottom stormwater storage. Wet bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed in
compliance with all the regulations which are applicable and govern the construction of dry
bottom stormwater storage areas. The following additional regulations shall apply:
Protection of the shoreline must be provided to alleviate soil erosion due to wave action.
This protection shall extend down the side slope to an elevation one foot below the
normal water surface elevation and up the side slope to an elevation one foot above the
normal water surface elevation. Approved shoreline protection methods include
vegetative turf reinforcement mats constructed in accordance with the manufacturer's
recommendations, riprap revetment constructed in accordance with the requirements of
the Illinois Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, latest edition, or retaining walls constructed from Allen Block or Portland
cement concrete. Alternative methods may be submitted to the Village Engineer for
approval.
Above-water side slopes shall be a maximum of four horizontal to one vertical. If retaining
walls are used, their height is limited to four feet. Retaining wall design and material type
shall be approved by the Village Engineer.
In accordance with Section 204 of the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, Illinois Department of Transportation (latest edition), below-water slopes
shall be a maximum of four horizontal to one vertical, except that slopes of two horizontal
to one vertical will be permitted below a point where the proposed water depth will be
eight feet or greater.
Wet bottom basins shall have a natural or artificial means of aeration to prevent pond
stagnation.

If fish or other aquatic wildlife are desired, a minimum depth of eight feet shall be
maintained over at least 25% of the pond's surface area.
An outlet structure shall be provided to allow dewatering of the pond for maintenance and
cleaning. Gravity dewatering is strongly preferred.
Wet bottom basin design shall include an evaluation of soil permeability. A basin liner
shall be included in the design if needed to ensure water retention to normal pool
elevation.
The control structure for stormwater release shall be designed to operate at full design
release rate with only a small increase in water depth in order to minimize the land
surface wetted by frequent minor stormwater runoff conditions.
The volume of water permanently stored shall not be considered to be part of the
required excess stormwater storage volume.
Paved stormwater storage. Design and construction of the pavement base must ensure that
there is no pavement damage due to flooding. Control structures in paved areas must be
readily accessible for maintenance and cleaning. Vortex control devices will be required.
Automobile parking lot storage areas. Automobile parking lots may be designed to provide
temporary detention storage on a portion of their surfaces. Automobile parking facilities used
to store excess stormwater must be constructed having a maximum depth of stored
stormwater of 0.5 foot; and these areas shall be located in the most remote, least-used areas
of the parking facility. Design and construction of automobile parking in stormwater areas
must ensure that there is no damage to the parking facility due to flooding, including damage
to the subbase. Warning signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn of possible
flood conditions during storm periods.
Underground stormwater storage. Underground stormwater storage facilities must be
designed for easy access in order to remove accumulated sediment and debris. These
facilities must be provided with a positive gravity outlet.
Stormwater storage areas which will be filled to capacity by frequent storms shall be designed
in a manner that will protect immediate downstream properties, and all overflow structures
shall be designed to function properly and effectively without the necessity of making manual
adjustments. A larger outlet for a stormwater storage area may be permitted by the Mayor or
his designee for the orderly management of stormwater runoff where large tributary areas
were developed without detention.
If the orderly management of the stormwater runoff cannot be achieved by passing the entire
tributary area runoff through the stormwater storage area, then the stormwater storage area
may be constructed to exclude the runoff from the tributary area originating outside of the
area to be developed.
Where the owner has a large tract of land upon which development is to occur in several
phases, the owner may construct, upon site-specific approval by the Village Engineer, one
stormwater storage facility which is designed to be enlarged at later dates as additional
portions of the owner's lands are developed and as additional stormwater storage is required
due to that development.
Where portions of the owner's land are tributary to the same drain for an outlet, but which are
within two or more tributary areas to that drain, the owner may construct, upon site-specific
approval by the Village Engineer, compensatory stormwater detention facilities within one
tributary area which offset the lack of construction of stormwater detention facilities in another
tributary area. Such compensatory storage shall be designed and constructed such that the
net effect of these facilities shall be to limit the amount of stormwater runoff released into the

drain to that which would have occurred had stormwater detention facilities been constructed
for all the tributary areas.
Stormwater storage areas may be planned and constructed jointly by two or more landowners
so long as compliance with this chapter is maintained.
Where fringe portions of the owner's land are, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, difficult
or impractical to drain to the detention facilities to be constructed for the rest of the property,
the owner may apply for a variance of the requirements of this chapter. Such a variance may
be granted for an area of land equal to up to 2% of the total property involved. In such cases,
a variance may be granted without owner's proof of the avoidance of an unnecessary
hardship and without specifically stating the public's interest in granting the variation.
Other requirements.
Automobile parking lots and other land uses with significant portions of paved and roofed
areas as determined by the Village Engineer shall be constructed with internal stormwater
runoff drainage systems.
Sump pumps. Sump pumps installed to receive and discharge groundwaters or stormwater
runoff shall be connected to the storm sewer where possible or discharged into a designated
stormwater runoff drainage facility. No discharge of stormwater runoff or groundwater by a
sump pump into a sanitary sewer shall be allowed. No discharge of sanitary sewage into a
storm drain shall be allowed.
No sump pump, footing drain, or downspout shall discharge onto a street surface, paved curb
and gutter system, or public sidewalk.
Downspouts. Downspouts and roof drains shall discharge onto the ground or be connected to
a storm drain. No downspouts or roof drains shall be connected to a sanitary sewer.
Footing drains. Footing drains and drainage tile shall discharge into a storm sewer or other
storm drainage facility. No footing drains or drainage tile shall be connected to a sanitary
sewer.
Sump pump drains. Any newly constructed or installed structure equipped with a sump pump
and located on property, any part of which is within 100 feet of a sump drain line or storm
sewer outlet, shall be required to connect to tie-in to such line or outlet.
§ 291-15. Accommodating flows from upstream tributary areas.
Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of the
property's drainage system. Whenever practicable, flows from upstream areas that are not to be
detained should be routed around the basin being provided for the site being developed.
Upstream areas not meeting code requirements.
When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this chapter, tributary to
the applicant's property, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall be explored
by the applicant or the Village. When it is deemed beneficial by the Village or the applicant to
explore such a design, the following steps shall be followed:
The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his property using the
release rates of § 291-14, the applicant's property area, and the procedures described in
§ 291-13.
Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the storage and release rate
requirements of this chapter, shall be identified.

Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property area, total storage
needed for the combined properties shall be computed.
Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined property areas. Storage shall
be computed as described in § 291-14. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable,
fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be used for the purposes of
computing storage.
Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the Village may choose to pay for oversizing
the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's
responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as computed above. If regional
storage is selected by the Village, then the design produced in § 291-13 shall be
implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the Village, the applicant shall bypass all
tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever practicable. If the applicant must
route upstream flows through his basin and the upstream areas exceed one square mile in
size, the applicant must meet the provisions of Subsection B for on-stream basins.
Upstream areas meeting requirements. When there are areas which meet the storage and release
rate requirements of this chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be
bypassed around the applicant's detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage
needed for the applicant's property shall be computed as described in Subsection A. However, if
the Village decides to route tributary area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design
stormwater releases shall be based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary
areas. It must be shown that at no time will the release rate from the combined property exceed
the allowable release rate for applicant's property alone.
§ 291-16. Early completion of detention facilities.
Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage
system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program.
Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant on a regular basis
and before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities.
Article IV. Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
§ 291-17. Findings.
The Village hereby finds that:
The soil types found in the Village are susceptible to erosion and if left unprotected could cause
severe loss of soil with resultant damage to property;
The topography of the Village contains areas with steep slopes which, if clearing of trees and/or
inappropriate construction takes place, could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems
which could result in damage to property;
Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain
nonagricultural uses, including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units, commercial
buildings and industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream
channels and drainageways, and the creation of recreational facilities;
The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health
and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles;
Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed-out fills, and embankments;

Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams,
lakes, sinkholes, wetlands, and reservoirs;
Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes, promotes the
growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly
and difficult to remove; and
Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and
natural depressions, resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
§ 291-18. General principles.
It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development
activities, including clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling of land, in the Village.
Water quality shall adhere to:
Illinois Environmental Protection Act (415 ILCS 5/12), from Ch. 111 1/2, par. 1011 and 1012;
Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations (Ill. Admin. Code): Title 35:
Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution Chapter I: Pollution Control Board, Part
302, Water Quality Standards; and
Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations (Ill. Admin. Code): Title 35:
Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board, Part
304, Effluent Standards.
Measures taken to control soil erosion and off-site sediment runoff shall be adequate to assure
that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year, twenty-four-hour
frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all new development or redevelopment
activities within the Village and to the preparation of the submissions required under § 291-19 of
this chapter:
New development or redevelopment shall be related to the topography and soils of the site so
as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes greater than 33% where
high cuts and fills may be required are to be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours
should be followed as closely as possible.
Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately
adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, sinkholes, and wetlands are to be left
undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must
include appropriate stabilization measures.
Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resulting from any necessary
development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond, sinkhole or wetland.
Preventive measures shall reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation.
The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed for the shortest practical time during
development.
Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other appropriate sediment or
runoff control measures shall be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to
remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing development.
The selection of erosion and sediment control measures shall be based on assessment of the
probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on
evaluation of the risks, costs, and benefits involved.

In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of
continuing maintenance must be considered.
Provision shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by changed soil and
surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways shall be designed so that
their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create
additional erosion on-site or downstream.
Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed and functional as soon as practical
during development.
Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses shall be vegetated
with an appropriate protective cover prior to development.
All waste generated as a result of site development activity shall be properly disposed of and
shall be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water.
All construction sites shall provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto
public or private roadways.
All temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be maintained to function as
intended until the contributing drainage area has been permanently stabilized, at which time
they shall be removed.
§ 291-19. Plan submission requirements.
Each applicant shall submit the information depending on development size, and regulated to ensure
that the provisions of this chapter are met. The submittal shall include sufficient information to evaluate
the environmental characteristics of the property, the potential adverse impacts of the development
related to erosion both on-site and off-site, and the effectiveness of the proposed erosion and sediment
control plan in reducing sediment loss and meeting the provisions of § 291-2. The applicant shall
certify on the drawing that all clearing, grading, drainage, and construction shall be accomplished in
strict conformance with the erosion and sediment control plan. The following information shall be
submitted for both existing and proposed property conditions, new developments or redevelopments

inches in diameter and larger shall be protected for their present and future value for
erosion protection and other environmental benefits. Trees that have been selected for
preservation shall be marked prior to the beginning of any clearing, grading, stripping,
excavation, or filling of the site. A "no construction" zone shall be established and marked
at the perimeter of the drip line of each tree which is to be preserved.
Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and diversions, and the outlets
of all channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed as regulated in Article III. All
constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized within 48 hours, consistent with the
standards as required in the IEPA Erosion Control Manual Standards and Specifications for
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control.
Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible, or as
regulated in Article III. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements
shall be met:
Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the maximum extent
practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be
constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The
stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be stabilized within 48 hours after
channel disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped.
Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting
accepted design standards and specifications.
Soil storage piles containing more than 10 cubic yards of material shall not be located with a
downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway, drainage channel, or sinkhole.

construction site wastes.
§ 291-23. Construction site stormwater pollution prevention plan.
Activities that are applicable to this chapter, per § 291-3, must provide a construction site
stormwater pollution prevention plan (CSSPPP).
The construction site stormwater pollution prevention plan may be a full-sized plan sheet with
necessary notes for requirements or may be a narrative explaining construction site operating
procedures to minimize or eliminate stormwater pollution as a result of construction activities.
The items covered in an approvable CSSPPP are dependent on the activities and the materials
required on site to complete the project. Therefore, the detail of the plan may be more or less
depending on site activities planned. Standard items included in a CSSPPP are, but are not
limited to:
Purpose.
Construction site description.
Activities/Materials to be addressed in the CSSPPP.
Construction site operating procedures.
Activities/Materials monitoring and maintenance.
Emergency and spill procedures.
Should construction site activities/materials change during construction, the CSSPPP must reflect
the changes. Therefore, the plan must be kept on-site at all times and be altered as necessary
with the approval of the Inspector. Should major changes be warranted, a revised plan must be
submitted for review and approval.
Article V. Maintenance Responsibilities
§ 291-24. Long-term maintenance responsibility.
Maintenance of stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment control facilities located on private
property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before an appropriate permit is
obtained from the Village, the applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the Village
guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its stormwater
drainage and erosion and sediment control system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the
Recorder of Deeds of the county. The maintenance agreement shall include a schedule for regular
maintenance of each aspect of the property's stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment control
system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized personnel of the
Village. The maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the appropriate personnel of the Village
notify the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property
owner shall begin such corrections within 72 hours, and correction shall not extend beyond 10
calendar days of such notification. If the corrections are not made within this time period, the Village
may have the necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner. The Village has
the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner for maintenance of the stormwater
drainage and erosion and sediment control system.

Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, which allows a direct or indirect
nonstormwater discharge to the storm drain system to enter the storm drain system is forbidden in the
Village. Illicit discharge may include but is not limited to any conveyances which allow any
nonstormwater discharge including sewage, process wastewater, and wash water to enter the storm
drain system and any connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains and sinks.
Article VI. Inspections
§ 291-26. Authority to inspect; schedule.
The Mayor or his designee shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve
that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply
with the stormwater drainage or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans for
grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the Mayor or his
designee shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections
and to ensure compliance with this chapter, the permittee shall notify the Mayor or his designee
within two working days of the completion of the construction stages specified below:
Upon completion of installation of the stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment control
measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any other
earth disturbance or grading;
After stripping and clearing;
After rough grading;
After final grading;
After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and
After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of sediment controls.
If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the permittee
shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work stages in
each phase or area. If an inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five
working days after notice is received by the Village from the permittee, the permittee may continue
work at his/her own risk, without presuming acceptance by the Village. Notification of the results of
the inspection shall be given in writing at the site.
§ 291-27. Construction activity inspections.
Qualified personnel (provided by the permittee) shall inspect disturbed areas of the construction site
that have not been finally stabilized, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or
exit the site at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm that is
0.5 inch or greater or equivalent snowfall. "Qualified personnel" means a person knowledgeable in the
principles and practice of erosion and sediment controls, such as a licensed professional engineer or
other knowledgeable person who possesses the skills to assess conditions at the construction site that
could impact stormwater quality and to assess the effectiveness of any sediment and erosion control
measures elected to control the quality of stormwater discharges from the construction activities.

If at any stage of the grading of any development site the Mayor or his designee determines by
inspection that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is
likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the Mayor or
his designee may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
special precautions to be taken as are considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril.
Special precautions may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope,
construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation
of plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or
engineering geologist, which may be made requirements for further work.
Possibility of storm damage. Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading
on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to
install temporary structures or to take such other measures as may be required to protect
adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions
prevail, the Mayor or his designee may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion
or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of
protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
§ 291-29. Amendment of plans.
Major amendments to stormwater drainage and detention or erosion and sediment control plans shall
be submitted to the Mayor or his designee and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the
same manner as the original plans. Field modification of a minor nature may be authorized by the
Mayor or his designee by written authorization to the permittee.

§ 295-33. Action on permit application.
Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications, containing all required
documentation, shall be examined by the Superintendent within a reasonable time after filing. If
the application does not conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws,
rules, and regulations, the Superintendent shall reject such application in writing, stating the
reasons therefor. If the Superintendent is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the
requirements of this article and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the
Superintendent shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the
duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the
construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of
this article.
Additional Village review of applications of telecommunications retailers.
Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act (220 ILCS 65/4), a telecommunications
retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to commence work governed by this article for
facilities for the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of
the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the Village not less
than 10 days prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than
30 days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Superintendent shall
specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used or
constructed.
In the event that the Superintendent fails to provide such specification of location to the
telecommunications retailer within either a) 10 days after service of notice to the Village by
the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new
construction or b) 25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the
case of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this article.
Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a permit is required for work
pursuant to § 295-32 of this article, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village
an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements
of Subsection A of this section.
Additional Village review of applications of holders of state authorization under the Cable and
Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-100 et seq.)
shall be deemed granted 45 days after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon by
the Village, provided the holder has complied with applicable Village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
§ 295-34. Effect of permit.
Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the Village authorizes
a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article on Village rights-ofway,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.

Duration. No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a period longer than six months
unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion.
Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under
this article prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who
will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with such Village
representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the
purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary
in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property
owners.
Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse the
permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations.
§ 295-35. Revised permit drawings.
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations
identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee
shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within 90 days after the completion of the
permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the
actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in
accordance with § 295-49 of this article. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms
to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
§ 295-36. Insurance.
Required coverages and limits.
Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying
right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the
Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in Subsection A(1)(a) and (b) below:
Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion,
collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred as "X," "C," and "U" coverages)
and products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than:
Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one accident; and
Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a combined single limit
of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for each accident;

Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000 per employee and
per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors
performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section.
Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of
primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess
coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by
the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to
the Village within 10 days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not
to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified
mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of
such intent to cancel or not to renew."
Within 10 days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event later than 10 days
prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of
replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit
requirements required by Subsection A of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to
the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under Subsection A, or the requirements of Subsections B, C and D of this section. A
utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
Subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the
Workers' Compensation Act (820 ILCS 305/1 et seq.).
Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the
Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or selfinsurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance
or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid
and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in
the State of Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and
of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.
§ 295-37. Indemnification.
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be deemed to agree to defend,
indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense,
arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed

or prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the
utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of
this article by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.
§ 295-38. Security.
Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in
this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at
the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:
The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article;
Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the permittee's failure
to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the
Village issued pursuant to this article; and
The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the
Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee in
violation of this article, including, without limitation, any damage to public property or
restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the Village must
perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform
or complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this article
or any other applicable law.
Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the Village in the form, at the permittee's
election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of
credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to
this subsection shall, at a minimum:
Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the permittee;
Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of any amounts
covered by it; and
Provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of Illinois at which it can be
drawn.
Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably
estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to
the construction under the permit, as determined by the Superintendent, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the
permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting
of construction of facilities in one location or related groups of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous
phase or phases, the Superintendent may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee
to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this Subsection C for any
single phase.
Withdrawals. The Village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for and
its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within
the fourteen-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village
has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the
permittee; or
Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the Village determines can be remedied
by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has
been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount
specified in Subsection C of this section.
Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security
fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the
Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum
balance required in Subsection C of this section.
Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on
deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other
applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all
accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover
any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the
permittee.
Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the security fund are in
addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized
by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or
otherwise violated.
§ 295-39. Permit suspension and revocation.
Village right to revoke permit. The Village may revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
article for one or more of the following reasons:
Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete statements in the permit
application;
Noncompliance with this article;
Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way presents a direct or imminent threat to the
public health, safety, or welfare; or
Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in accordance with the permit and
approved plans.

suspend a permit issued pursuant to this article, stating the reason or reasons for the revocation
or suspension and the alternatives available to permittee under this § 295-39.

Village for all costs of removal.
§ 295-40. Change of ownership or owner's identity or legal
status.

the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including this article,
with respect to the work and facilities in the right-of-way.

§ 295-45. Vegetation control.
Electric utilities; compliance with state laws and regulations. An electric utility shall conduct all
tree-trimming and vegetation control activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable
Illinois laws and regulations and, additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement with the
Village as permitted by law.
Other utilities; tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is done by any other utility with
facilities in the right-of-way, and that is not performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and
regulations specifically governing the same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance
operation, but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any
other permit required under this article.
Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree trimming permits shall include
assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are
experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be
tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment
of damages. The Village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for
trees removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or
unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the removal and replacement of trees
if trimming or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.
Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The Village may require that special measures be
taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special significance. The required measures may
consist of higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
Chemical use.
Except as provided in the following subsection, no utility shall spray, inject or pour any
chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation in the Village for any purpose, including
the control of growth, insects or disease.
Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be permitted on rights-of-way unless
the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control.
§ 295-46. Removal, relocation or modification of facilities.
Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the Village, a utility shall, at its own expense,
protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the Village, any
utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within
the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the
following circumstances:

such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that
the Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of
abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
§ 295-47. Site cleanup and restoration.
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other property within 10

maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the Village. This includes restoration of entrances
and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved
by the Superintendent. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading,
reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period provided in

§ 295-48. Maintenance and emergency maintenance.
General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be
maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.
Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify noncompliance with normal
procedures for securing a permit.
If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall
take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the
public on the right-of-way, including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flags. If a hazard
does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the
parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights
shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when
no other means of access to the facility is available.
In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the Superintendent or his or her
duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been

practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public.

undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after an emergency repair.
§ 295-49. Variances.
Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the provisions of this
article must do so in writing to the Superintendent as a part of the permit application. The request
shall identify each provision of this article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why
a variance should be granted.
Authority to grant variances. The Superintendent shall decide whether a variance is authorized for
each provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
Conditions for granting of variance. The Superintendent may authorize a variance only if the utility
requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an
irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the
provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the
provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested
approach.
Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the
Superintendent may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and
conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the
purposes of this article.
Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination,
including denial of a variance, made by the Superintendent under the provisions of this article shall
have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within 30
days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall
commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide
the appeal.
§ 295-50. Penalty.
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of
this article shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be
times when the Village will incur delay or other costs, including third-party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that
another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear
the Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission
may review or overrule a permit-related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed

Part 3. Plats and Plans
Article I. Preliminary Plats
§ 300-9. General procedure.
Before preparing a proposed plat for an area, the owner, developer, or their representatives should
have an informal pre-application meeting with the Plan Commission and/or the Village Engineer to
determine applicable ordinance regulations and standards which must be complied with and whether
an area general plan will be required. After the pre-application meeting(s), the subdivider should then
prepare an area general plan as needed and a preliminary plat. As defined in this chapter, the
preliminary plat must contain a substantial amount of data, and will thus be incomplete and cannot be
considered as filed until all required data are submitted. The preliminary plat is received with filing fees
by the Village Clerk's office, which, in turn, will forward the same to the Plan Commission for its review.
Following its review (as well as comments from other appropriate agencies when required), the Plan
Commission forwards its recommendation(s) to the Village Board, which then either approves,
disapproves, or approves with modifications the preliminary plat.
§ 300-10. Filing procedures.
Except as specifically provided otherwise below, every person who proposes to subdivide any land
located within the subdivision jurisdiction of the Village shall file six copies of the preliminary plat of
said subdivision with the Village Clerk.
He shall also file one copy of the preliminary plat and supporting data with the appropriate Soil and
Water Conservation District. Said district shall have not more than 30 days to submit any
comments it might wish to make to the Administrator. (See 70 ILCS 405/22.02a.)

§ 300-14. Rights and privileges of subdivider.
Preliminary plat approval shall confer the following rights and privileges upon the subdivider:
That the preliminary plat will remain in effect for a one-year period from the day the Village Board
approves the same. The applicant may, during this period, submit all or part or parts of said
preliminary plat for final approval. In the event that the subdivision is being developed in stages,
the applicant may, by written mutual agreement with the Village Board, have final approval of the
last part of the plat delayed for a period not to exceed five years from the date of the preliminary
plat approval. Any part of a subdivision which is being developed in stages shall contain a tract of
land at least one block in area or five gross acres.
That the general terms and conditions under which the preliminary plat approval was granted will
not be changed for final approval.
The applicant may also proceed with any detailed improvement plans required for all facilities or
utilities intended to be provided. Actual construction of such facilities and improvements may
commence prior to final plat approval if the detailed improvement plans have been recommended
by the Village Engineer and approved by the Village Board, provided that such facilities and
improvements will be inspected throughout their construction, and final plat approval will be
contingent in part upon acceptable compliance to Village improvement and facilities standards. If
the applicant does not submit the improvement plans prior to the submission of the final plat, then
he shall submit the improvement plans to the Village Clerk's office at the time that the final plat is
submitted.
Article II. Improvement Plans
§ 300-15. Submission of plans.

improvements to be installed within or in conjunction with the proposed development, and pay all
associated filing fees before review by the Village Engineer. These plans and specifications shall
be signed and sealed by the registered professional engineer responsible for their preparation.
Until the Village Engineer certifies in writing that the proposed improvements conform to generally
accepted engineering practices and to the standards in this chapter:
The Administrator shall not issue any building permit to allow construction of said
improvements; and
The Village Board shall not act upon the application for final plat approval. (See § 300-26.)

monuments (set in such a manner that they will not be moved by frost) which mark the
external boundaries of the tract to be divided or subdivided and must designate upon the plat
the locations where they may be found;
Monumentation shall be set in the field by the professional land surveyor preparing the plat or
personnel under his direct supervision. The plat shall be a true and accurate scaled
representation of the monuments set or recovered in the field, and the monument location,
type, material and size shall be as shown on the plat. Monuments shall be set at the true
location of each lot corner, block corner, point of radial curvature and point of radial tangency,
as well as the exterior boundaries of the tract to be subdivided. Witness corners may only be
used where physical barriers prevent setting the monument at the true location or where
monumentation already exists representing the same point. All monuments set in the field
shall contain, at a minimum, a 1/2-inch-by-30-inch-long ferrous or magnetic source that is
recoverable by ferrous metal-detecting equipment commonly employed in the land surveying
practice. Monuments shall also bear the registration number of the professional land surveyor
and be set flush with the final surface elevation;
In the event a private septic disposal system is proposed for each lot, certification by a
registered Illinois professional engineer will be required on the face of the plat or in subsidiary
documents certifying that the proposed land use, the proposed lots and the known soil
properties and characteristics of the area are adequate for such systems in accordance with
Illinois Department of Public Health standards;
Drainage statement by a registered Illinois professional engineer certifying that to the best of
his knowledge and belief, the drainage of surface waters will not be changed by the
construction of the subdivision or any part thereof, or that if such surface water drainage will
be changed, reasonable provision has been made for collection and diversion of such surface
waters into public areas, or drains, which the owner has a right to use, and that such surface
waters will be planned for in accordance with Chapter 291, Stormwater Management, of the
Village Code and generally accepted engineering practices so as to reduce the likelihood of
damage to adjoining properties because of the construction of the subdivision. Said statement
shall also be executed by the owner and developer.
In addition, the subdivider shall furnish the Village Board with a sample sales contract which
reflects both restrictive covenants and local development ordinances to which the property will be
subject.
§ 300-29. Certificates required.
As required by state law (765 ILCS 205/2; 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8), the certificates included in Attachment 1
to this chapter, Final Plat Certificates, shall be executed on the final plat.

§ 300-30. Administrative review; Plan Commission advisory
report.
Within 30 days from the date of application for final plat approval, the Village Engineer and the
Administrator shall review said final plat (and supporting data), and shall each advise the Village Board
in writing whether it substantially conforms to the approved preliminary plat and improvement plans. A
copy of their advisory report shall be forwarded to the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission may
prepare an addendum to said report (should it so desire), and forward same to the Village Board.
§ 300-31. Action by Village Board.
The Village Board shall either approve or disapprove the application for final plat approval by
resolution within 60 days from the date of said application or the filing of the last item of required
supporting data, whichever date is later, unless the Board and the subdivider mutually agree to
extend this time limit. The Village Board shall not approve any final plat unless:
The final plat substantially conforms to the approved preliminary plat; and
The final plat manifests substantial compliance with the design and improvements standards
of this chapter, the Village Zoning Code, and the Official Map; and
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
To the Board's knowledge and belief, the final plat complies with all pertinent requirements of
state law; and
Either of the following has been met:
All required improvements have been completed, inspected, accepted, and dedicated; or
The subdivider/developer has posted a performance bond to guarantee the satisfactory
completion and dedication of all required improvements.
If the Village Board disapproves the final plat, its resolution shall specify the aspects in which the
plat fails to meet the above conditions for approval.
The Village Clerk shall attach a certified copy of the Board's resolution of approval or disapproval
to the final plat. One copy of the resolution and plat shall be retained by the Clerk, one copy shall
be filed with the Administrator, and one copy shall be given to the subdivider.
(See 65 ILCS 5/11-2-8.)
§ 300-32. Changes in approved final plats.
Once a final plat is approved by the Village Board, it shall not thereafter be modified; provided,
however, that minor changes may be made upon written application to the Administrator. Major
changes require the filing of a new final plat and complete re-review. (See § 300-40.)

D.
The subdivider/developer shall maintain all the improvements in the subdivision until they have been
accepted by and dedicated to the Village or other appropriate entity.
§ 300-34. Maintenance bond.
Prior to dedication, the subdivider/developer shall post a maintenance bond with the Village Clerk in
the form approved by the Village Attorney. Said bond shall be in the amount of 25% of the approved
construction estimate amount as determined by the Village Engineer to be sufficient to guarantee the
satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of two years from the date of their
acceptance and dedication. In addition to the subdivision improvements, the maintenance bond shall
also be sufficient to guarantee satisfactory restoration of infrastructure surrounding the subdivision
which, in the opinion of the Village, with reasonable inference is attributable to construction of the
subdivision. If at any time during the two-year period the improvements are found to be defective or
problems above develop, they shall be repaired, replaced, or corrected at the subdivider's/developer's
expense. If the subdivider/developer fails or refuses to pay such costs within 90 days after demand is
made upon him by the Administrator, the Village shall use the maintenance bond to make the
necessary repairs, replacements, or corrections. If the cost of repairs, replacements, or corrections
exceeds the bond amount, the subdivider/developer shall be liable for the excess. At the end of the
two-year period, the maintenance bond shall be released. (See Schedule F, included as an attachment
to this chapter.)
Article VI. Vacation of Plats
§ 300-35. Time and procedure.
In accordance with state law (765 ILCS 205/6, 205/7, and 205/8), any plat or part thereof may be
vacated by the owner of the tract, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written vacation
instrument to which a copy of the plat is attached. If there are public service facilities in any street,
other public way, or easement shown on said plat, the instrument shall reserve to the Village or other
public entity or public utility owning such facilities the property, rights-of-way and easements necessary
for continuing public service by means of those facilities and for maintaining or reconstructing the
same. The vacation instrument shall be approved by the Board in the same manner as plats of
subdivision and shall also be approved by the County Engineer, the Highway Commissioner, the
District Engineer of the State Department of Transportation, and the public utilities. In the case of the
platted tracts wherein any lots have been sold, the written vacation instrument must also be signed by
all the owners of lots in said tracts.
Part 4. Administrative Procedures
§ 300-36. Duties of enforcement officer.

improvements;
To evaluate and pass upon proposed changes in approved final plats (See § 300-32.);
To review and forward applications for subdivision variances to the Plan Commission (See § 300-
37.);
To maintain up-to-date records of matters pertaining to this chapter, including, but not limited to,
preliminary plats, as-built records of completed improvements (See § 300-18.), final plats,
variances, and amendments;
To provide information to subdividers/developers and to the general public on matters related to
this chapter; and
To periodically review the provisions of this chapter to determine whether revisions are needed,
and to make recommendations on such matters to the Village Plan Commission as necessary.
§ 300-37. Subdivision variances.
Any subdivider/developer desiring a variance from the requirements of this chapter shall file a written
application therefor with the Administrator at the same time that he files his preliminary plat. The
application shall fully explain the grounds for the variance request and specify the section(s) of this
chapter which, if strictly applied, would cause great practical difficulties or hardship. The Administrator
shall prepare an advisory report on every variance application and submit it, together with the
completed application, to the Plan Commission.
§ 300-38. Review by Plan Commission.
The Plan Commission shall review the variance application and the Administrator's comments, perform
on-site review when appropriate, and submit its advisory report to the Village Board, together with its
recommendation on preliminary plat approval. (See § 300-10.) The Plan Commission's advisory report
shall be responsive to all the variances standards set forth in § 300-39.
§ 300-39. Action by Village Board; variance standards.
At the same meeting at which it takes action on the application for preliminary plat approval (See
§ 300-13.), the Village Board shall decide by resolution whether to grant or to deny the requested
subdivision variance. A copy of the Board's decision, clearly stating its reasons therefor and the
exact terms of any variance granted, shall be attached to both the preliminary and final plats.
The Village Board shall not grant any subdivision variance unless, based upon the information
presented to it, the Board determines that:
The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of this chapter (See § 300-2.);
and
Strict application of the subdivision requirements (See Part 5.) would result in great practical
difficulties or hardship to the applicant, not a mere inconvenience; and
The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the subdivision requirements that will
alleviate the difficulties/hardship; and
The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of his own making; and

The peculiar circumstances creating the variance request are not applicable to other tracts
and, therefore, a variance would be a more appropriate remedy than a code amendment; and
The variance, if granted, will not materially frustrate the implementation of the Comprehensive
Plan, including the Official Map. (See § 300-44.)
Financial consideration or peculiar circumstances do not constitute a hardship.

Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the Village from taking any other lawful action that
may be necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
Part 5. Design and Improvement Standards
Article I. General Provisions
§ 300-43. Applicability of standards.
No land within the corporate limits or extrajurisdictional territory of the Village shall be subdivided
or developed except in compliance with the regulations of this Part 5 and the applicable provisions
of state law. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8; 765 ILCS 205/1 et seq.)
No lot in any subdivision shall be conveyed until:
The final plat of said subdivision has been approved by the Village Board and recorded in the
office of the County Recorder of Deeds; and
The portion of said subdivision in which the lot is located has been improved in accordance
with the requirements of this Part 5 or until a performance bond or other security has been
posted to assure the completion of such improvements.
§ 300-44. Suitability for development generally.
Land that is unsuitable for development due to flooding, poor drainage, rough topography, adverse soil
conditions, or other features which will be harmful to the health, safety, and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the development and/or its surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed
unless the subdivider/developer formulates adequate plans/methods to solve the problems caused by
the adverse land conditions.
§ 300-45. Reservations for public use.
At the discretion of the Village Board, the developer may be required to reserve for future use or
dedicate at the time of platting land for parks, pathways, playgrounds, schools, or other public
purposes in locations designated in the Village's Comprehensive Plan, if any, in accordance with 765
ILCS 205/3. In the event that land is reserved for future public use within a proposed subdivision, the
land shall be conveyed as commons areas to a homeowners' association or other entity formed under
the subdivision covenants. Said reserved land shall remain under ownership and maintenance of the
homeowners' association or other entity until such time as the Village Board takes action to improve
the land for public benefits listed above. At such time, the reserved land shall be dedicated to the
Village in fee simple without compensation.
Article II. Lot Requirements
§ 300-46. Conformity with zoning.
All lots in a subdivision shall conform to the minimum lot area and dimensions requirements of the
zoning district in which said subdivision is located; land that is under water or reserved for street
improvements shall not be counted to satisfy these minimum requirements. Every corner and through
lot shall be large enough to permit compliance with the district's front setback requirements on every

side of the lot that faces a street. All lot remnants shall be added to adjacent lots to avoid the creation
of parcels that cannot be built upon. All lots shall contain adequate space for required off-street parking
and loading.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 360, Zoning.
§ 300-47. Access and relationship to street.
Land shall be subdivided in such a way that each lot abuts a street meeting the requirements of § 300-
49. All side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street right-of-way lines or radial to curved street
right-of-way lines except where a deviation from this rule will provide a better street and lot design.
Article III. Street Design Standards
§ 300-48. Plan integration.
All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed street system indicated in the
municipal Comprehensive Plan, and shall meet the specifications set forth in Table of Street Design
Specifications included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 300-49. Right-of-way and pavement widths.
Every right-of-way established for subdivision purposes is to be separate and distinct from the lots
or parcels adjoining such right-of-way and not included within the dimensions or areas of such lots
or parcels. All rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the public by the developer.
The minimum pavement widths shall be as noted in the Table of Street Design Specifications
included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 300-50. Topographical considerations.
Grades of street shall conform as closely as possible to the natural topography, but shall not exceed
the maximum grade nor be less than the minimum grade indicated in the Table of Street Design
Specifications included as an attachment to this chapter. All streets shall be arranged so that as many
as possible of the building sites are at or above street grade.
§ 300-51. Through traffic discouraged.
Marginal access and local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage use by through traffic. The rigid
rectangular gridiron street pattern shall be avoided, and the use of curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac, or
U-shaped streets shall be encouraged to effect a more desirable street layout.
§ 300-52. Limited access to arterials.
Where a development abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Plan Commission
may recommend to the Village Board that access to said arterial street be limited by one of the
following means:
By subdividing lots so they back onto the arterial street and front onto a parallel local street
(double-frontage lots), coupled with the installation of screening in a reserve (access-restricting)
strip along the rear lot lines of such lots;

A series of culs-de-sac, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and generally at right
angles to the arterial street, with the rear lot lines of the lots at the termini of such streets backing
onto the arterial street; or
A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting strip, but having access thereto at
suitable points.
§ 300-53. Dead-end streets.
Temporary stub streets. Streets shall be so arranged as to provide for the continuation of principal
streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient
movement of traffic, effective fire and police protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and
where such continuation comports with the Village's Official Map. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must dead-end temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the
property line, and no strip that would prevent connections with future streets shall be reserved. A
temporary turnabout shall be provided at the terminus of any temporary dead-end street, if
required by the Village.
Permanent dead-end streets.
For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent
dead-end streets shall be limited to 500 feet in length.
The terminus of a permanent dead-end street shall not be closer than 50 feet to the boundary
of an adjacent tract. A cul-de-sac turnaround, having a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet
and a minimum pavement radius of 42 feet, shall be provided at the end of every permanent
dead-end street.
§ 300-54. Intersections.
Only two streets. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point.
Right angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles; in no
case shall two streets intersect at an angle of less than 75°. An oblique street shall be curved
approaching an intersection and shall be approximately at right angles with said intersection for at
least 100 feet therefrom.
Proper alignment. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, whenever
practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs
with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected
street has divided lanes without median breaks at either intersection. Intersections involving
collector or arterial streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
Curb radii. To permit safe vehicular movements at corners, the minimum curb radius at the
intersection of two streets shall be 25 feet from back of curb.
Flat grade. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly terrain, an
area having not greater than a 3% slope for a distance of 50 feet from the nearest right-of-way line
of the intersecting street shall be provided at the approach to an intersection.
Slope. Pavement slopes shall be a minimum of 0.4% and a maximum of 8%. There shall be a
three-inch-minimum crown in all pavements.
Adequate sight lines. Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation,
there must be adequate sight lines and distances for the traveling public, both vehicular and
pedestrian. No earth banks or existing vegetation within a triangular area on a lot at the

lines measured from the corner intersection of the property lines to a minimum distance of 15 feet
from their intersection and the third side of which is the line measured from the end points of each
of the other two lines, shall exceed three feet in height above street grade.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 300-55. Curves.
A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on local and collector
streets.
Horizontal curves in streets shall be permitted, provided no curve shall be greater than that
approved by the Village Engineer as reasonably safe for traffic and the particular location of the
curve.
§ 300-56. Improvements to existing streets.
Whenever any development abuts an existing street that is narrower than the standards indicated in
the Table of Street Design Specifications,[1] the subdivider shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way on the
side abutting the development to permit compliance with those standards. The developer shall improve
said street to the standards imposed in § 300-60 et seq., and pay 1/2 the cost of said improvements.
Editor's Note: See Table 5-A, included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 300-57. When excess right-of-way required.
Right-of-way width in excess of the standards set forth in the Table of Street Design Specifications[1]
shall be required where:
Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes; or
Due to the location of railroad tracks, additional width is needed to construct overpasses,
underpasses, and approaches thereto.
Editor's Note: See Table 5-A, included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 300-58. Street jogs.
Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted if the same can be
reasonably avoided.

Any request for proposed audit pursuant to any locally administered tax shall comply with the notice
requirements of this article.
Each notice of audit shall contain the following information:
The tax;
The time period of the audit;
A brief description of the books and records to be made available for the auditor; and
Clear identification of who will be conducting the audit.
[Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Any audit shall be conducted during normal business hours; and if the date and time selected by
the local tax administrator is not agreeable to the taxpayer, another date and time may be
requested by the taxpayer within 30 days after the originally designated audit and during normal
business hours.
The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit conducted. The audit shall be
conducted not less than seven days nor more than 30 days from the date the notice is given,
unless the taxpayer and the local tax administrator agreed to some other convenient time. In the
event the taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the taxpayer may
request another date within the 30 days, approved in writing, that is convenient to the taxpayer
and the local tax administrator.
Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's business or activities,
including original source documents and books of entry denoting the transactions which had given
rise or may have given rise to any tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in
the English language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the Village.
It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available its books and records for
inspection by the Village. If the taxpayer or Tax Collector fails to provide the documents necessary
for audit within the time provided, the local tax administrator may issue a tax determination and
assessment based on the tax administrator's determination of the best estimate of the taxpayer's
tax liability.
If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally imposed and administered tax
as a result of the audit, written notice of the amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer
within 30 days of the Village's determination of the amount of overpayment.
In the event a tax payment was submitted to the incorrect local governmental entity, the local tax
administrator shall notify the local governmental entity imposing such tax.
For audits being conducted by third-party providers, the Village must provide written authorization
for the third-party provider to review the books and records of the taxpayer. No contact may be
made by the third-party provider until the Village authorization is received by the taxpayer. The
auditor must sign a confidentiality agreement upon request by the taxpayer. Upon the completion
of the audit, the local jurisdiction must issue an audit closure report to the taxpayer with the results
of the audit.

A taxpayer who receives written notice from the local tax administrator of a determination of tax

hearing, setting forth the basis of the taxpayer's request for a hearing. The written protest and
petition for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator within 45 days of receipt of the

If a timely written notice and petition for hearing is filed, the local tax administrator shall fix the time
and place for hearing and shall give written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled
for a date within 14 days of receipt of the written protest and petition for hearing, unless the
taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.

determination, audit or assessment shall become a final bill due and owing without further notice.
Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full payment of the contested tax
liability along with interest accrued as of the due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may
reopen or extend the time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or extended for more than 90
days after the expiration of the forty-five-day period.

under § 313-9 above, the local tax administrator shall conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.
No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to
protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any
continuance granted shall not exceed 14 days.
At the hearing, the local tax administrator shall preside and shall hear testimony and accept any
evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit or assessment. The strict rules of evidence
applicable to judicial proceedings shall not apply.

and prior to the Village issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure-tofile
penalty shall be assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance.
§ 313-12. Waiver or abatement of penalties.
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late filing penalty, late
payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause
exists for delay or failure to make a filing.
§ 313-13. Installment contracts.
The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the
controlling tax ordinance. The local tax administrator may not cancel any installment contract so
entered unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the local
tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer shall have 14 working days to
cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen-day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator, the
installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the taxpayer.
§ 313-14. Statute of limitations.
The Village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely
manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days after
receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due
and owing.
No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four years maximum after the
end of the calendar year for which the return for the applicable period was filed or for the calendar
year in which the return for the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
If any tax return is not filed or if, during any four-year period for which a notice of tax determination
or assessment may be issued by the Village, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the
statute of limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which the
return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the return for the
applicable period was filed.
The statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax return was filed by the taxpayer.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
§ 313-15. Voluntary disclosure.
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of
an audit, investigation, or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an
application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a
voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per
month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any
additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if
the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the

underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the
result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and
void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any
additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the
additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.
§ 313-16. Publication of tax ordinances.
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or standard publishing
requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the internet shall satisfy the publication requirements.

valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax
administrator shall:
Timely remove the lien at the Village's expense;
Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
§ 313-18. Interpretation; conflict with other laws.

appropriate account.
Failure to receive bill. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a customer from his obligation to
pay within the time specified. Should the Department be unable to bill a customer for services
used during any month, the following billing shall include the charges for services used during the
unbilled month.
Request to discontinue service. Services shall have been deemed to have been supplied to any
property connected to the water and sewer systems during a month unless the customer notifies
the Village prior to the first day of the new billing month in which the services are to be
discontinued.
Billing; utility shut-off; hearing.
If a bill is not paid on the 20th day of the month, then a penalty equal to 5% of the current bill
shall be added thereto on the 21st day of the month.
A delinquent or "Final Notice" is mailed on the 22nd day of the month to any customer who is
30 days past due.
The customers are given five days from the date of the "Final Notice" or they will be shut off.
(This date does not include days the office is not opened.)
If the office does not hear from the customer in the time allowed, then a "Red Tag" is issued.
The "Red Tag" gives the customer an additional three working days to pay. The "Red Tag" is
hand delivered to the customer's address by Westville gas and water personnel.
If the office still does not hear from the customer, a work order to have the customer's
service(s) shut off is written up.

record, then the Village shall notify the owner of the property by first-class mail.
Once utility services have been disconnected, the same shall not be again connected or used
until all delinquent accounts and bills of service are paid in full, including a fee for each
connection of such utility services as set from time to time by the Board of Trustees by

Lien notice.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]

This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the
unpaid bill, and a notice that the Village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges
for utility services served subsequent to the period covered by the bill. The Village Gas and
Water Clerk will notify by first class mail, to the last known address, intent to file on the
property for unpaid gas or water bills.
If the consumer of utility services whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises, and
the Gas and Water Clerk has notice of this, then notice shall be mailed to the owner of the

premises, if his address is known to the Gas and Water Clerk, whenever such bill remains
unpaid for a period of 45 days after it has been rendered.
The failure of the Gas and Water Clerk to record such lien or to mail such notice, or the failure
of the owner to receive such notice, shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid
utility bills as mentioned herein.
Foreclosure of lien.
Property subject to a lien for unpaid utility charges may be sold for nonpayment of the same,
and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is
the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill-in-equity in the
name of the Village.
The Village Attorney is hereby authorized to institute such proceedings in the name of the
Village in any court having jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which the
bill for utility services has remained unpaid 60 days after it has been rendered.
Under the provisions of Subsection I, when invoked by the Village, a customer shall, in addition to
all of the utility charges and penalties provided for in the Village Code, be required to pay the
reasonable attorneys fees and filing fees incurred by the Village as a result of preparing and filing
such lien, with such fee to be set from time to time by ordinance of the Village Board, with such
fee now determined and actual cost which will compensate the Village for attorney fees and
expenses of filing a lien notice. Upon payment of the utility services specified in said lien notice,
and the fees herein assessed, the Village shall submit to the customer a release of lien, and it will
be the customer's obligation to record the same and pay for the recording fees on the same.
§ 318-6. Liability for charges.
The owner of any lot, parcel of land or premises receiving utility services, the occupant of such
premises and the user of the services shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the
services to such lot, parcel of land, or premises, and all services are rendered to the premises by the
Village only on the condition that such owner, occupant and user shall be jointly and severally liable
therefor to the Village.
§ 318-7. Estimated charges.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Whenever any meter, by reason of its being out of repair, or from any cause, fails to properly register
the utilities passing through the same, the consumer shall be charged the average charge of the
previous three months' usage. If no record of the previous three months exists, then it shall be the duty

§ 318-38. Discontinuance of service.
The Village Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the
occupant thereof, the water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the
provisions of this Part 3 is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water supply
distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored until such conditions have
been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this Part 3 and until a
reconnection fee in an amount set from time to time by resolution of the Board of Trustees is paid
to the Village Clerk.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be effected when the Inspector is assured that
imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water supply system exists. Such action
shall be followed by written notification of the cause of disconnection. Immediate disconnection
without notice to any party can be effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or
pollution of the public water supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Inspector or the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, such action is required to prevent actual or potential
contamination or pollution of the public water supply.
The public water supply, the Inspector or the agents or assigns shall not be liable to any customer

method shall not be allowed when the wye branch is larger than four inches in diameter. The
entire sewer main in the location of the wye and the wye shall be encased in concrete.
Using the pipe cutter only, neatly and accurately cut out desired length of pipe for insertion of
proper fitting. Remove both hub and bell ends, or other compression couplings, from wye
branch fitting to allow the wye branch to be inserted with no more than a total of a 1/2-inch
gap. Use "Band Seal" couplings, or similar couplings, and shear rings and clamps to fasten
the inserted fitting and hold it firmly in place. The entire section shall then be encased in
concrete having a minimum thickness of four inches and extending eight inches beyond each
joint.
If another method is desired, a detail shall be submitted for review and approval by the Village
before the connection is made. Indiscriminate breaking of the sewer main pipe is not allowed.
On-site inspection. After the wye branch has been inserted and jointed, and before any additional
fittings have been placed in the service line, the installation shall be approved by the
Superintendent, or his authorized representative. After approval is granted, the contractor shall
encase the work area as specified herein.
Backfill shall be placed in accordance with the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main
Construction in Illinois, Current Edition. In addition, any building sewer crossing any street or
traveled alley shall be backfilled with CA-86 backfill material.
Concrete encasement. When a riser is constructed and its height is four feet or more measured
from the flowline of the sewer main to the top of the riser pipe, the wye connection shall be
encased in concrete to a height of at least one foot six inches above the flowline of the sewer
main. When the height of the riser is less than four feet above the flowline of the sewer main, the
wye connection shall be backfilled to the top of the riser pipe with carefully placed and compacted
granular backfill.
§ 318-93. Capacity of system.
A building sewer permit will only be issued and a sewer connection shall only be allowed if it can be
demonstrated that the downstream sewer facilities, including sewer, pump stations and sewer
treatment facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and efficiently handle the additional
anticipated waste load.
§ 318-94. Tap-in supervision and testing.
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Village when the building sewer is
ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the Village or its representative.
At any time after the installation of the building sewer, the Village may test the building sewer for
violation of this Part 4.
§ 318-95. Inspections.
After the building sewer has been constructed in the trench but before the sewer is backfilled, the
applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Superintendent that the building sewer is ready
for inspection. If the sewer has been constructed properly, permission will be given to backfill the
trench. If the sewer construction is found to be unsuitable, the permit applicant will correct the
installation to meet Village requirements.

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference
is made in this Part 4 shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of
Laboratories Manual of Laboratory Methods, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided
or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will
determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether
a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.)

accordance with this Part 4, by the industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance with
federal and state guidelines for a user charge system and industrial cost recovery system. (See Part 4,

employees engaged in highway construction, contract or work upon the roadways or public ways
approved by the Village. No person shall possess a traffic control signal, sign or marker owned by

relieve the driver of the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection or
when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrian or other traffic or by reason of weather or
highway conditions. Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any
person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of
all persons to use due care.

of the registered owner, lienholder or other person legally entitled to ownership of the impounded
vehicle is determined. Exceptions to a notification by certified mail to the registered owner,
lienholder and other legally entitled persons are set forth in 625 ILCS 5/4-209.

Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and

Code Hearing Department. If the request is timely filed, a Hearing Officer of the City shall conduct
such hearing within 72 hours after the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. All
interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The formal
rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after

subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the Hearing Officer shall order the
continued impoundment of the vehicle until the full evidentiary hearing pursuant to this section,
unless the vehicle owner posts the applicable cash bond, and a notice of such full evidentiary
hearing shall be given to the vehicle owner.
Unless the vehicle owner has received a notice, after a hearing held pursuant to Subsection A
above, within 10 days after a motor vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the
City of Danville Code Hearing Department shall notify, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
the owner of record of the date, time and location of a full evidentiary hearing concerning the
seizure and impoundment. Such hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order
of the Hearing Officer, no later than 30 days after the motor vehicle was seized. All interested

If, after the hearing set forth in Subsection B above, the Hearing Officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the motor vehicle was used in the commission of or in conjunction
with any of the offenses described in § 330-1 and that none of the exceptions set forth in § 330-2
applies, then the Hearing Officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the motor
vehicle civilly liable to the City and impose the penalties set forth in this chapter. If the Hearing
Officer determines that no such violation occurred, the Hearing Officer shall order the return of the
motor vehicle and/or any cash bond posted and towing and storage fees paid.
In the event that the owner of record desires to appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer under
the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Act (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.), he shall pay the
costs of the preparation and transcription of the record of the hearing.
§ 330-6. Penalty.
[Amended 7-28-2015 by Ord. No. 15-1455; 3-8-2016 by Ord. No. 16-1463]
Whenever a motor vehicle is used in the commission of or in conjunction with any of the offenses
described in § 330-1, the motor vehicle may be impounded and the owner of record of the motor
vehicle shall be liable for an administrative penalty in the amount of $500 for the first offense and
any applicable towing and storage fees and the amount of $750 for the second offense or any
subsequence offense and any applicable towing and storage fee.
Costs. In addition to a fine or other penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter, the owner of record
shall be ordered to pay the costs and fees incurred by the Village in prosecuting the violation,
which shall include, but not be limited to, the costs associated with an administrative adjudication
proceeding or court proceeding, and reasonable attorney's fees.
If a penalty is imposed pursuant to this chapter, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing
to the Village. The owner of record's obligation to pay such debt to the Village shall be
independent of the Village's return of any impounded motor vehicle. If a bond has been posted,
the Hearing Officer shall enter an order deducting from the bond so posted any fines and fees
imposed pursuant to this chapter.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an impounded motor vehicle shall be returned to the
owner of record, or other person who is legally entitled to possess the motor vehicle, upon his or
her payment to the Village of the penalty or penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter, including
the towing and storage fees, unless the motor vehicle has been sold or otherwise disposed of to
satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever a person with a lien of record
against a motor vehicle impounded under this chapter has commenced foreclosure or
repossession proceedings, possession of the motor vehicle shall be given to that person, but only
upon agreeing, in writing, to refund to the Village the net proceeds of any sale of the motor
vehicle, less any amounts necessary to pay all lien holders of record, up to the total amount of
penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter which are outstanding.
§ 330-7. Unclaimed vehicles.
Any motor vehicle which is not reclaimed within 30 days after expiration of the time during which the
owner of record may seek judicial review of the Village's actions pursuant to this chapter, or the time at
which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the Village, or the time a final administrative hearing is
entered against an owner of record who is found in default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed motor
vehicle as provided by law.

§ 360-3. Establishment of zoning districts; Zoning Map.
Zoning districts. For the purposes of this code, the Village is hereby divided into zoning districts
hereafter provided in Article II.
The boundaries of the zones are established as shown on the Village Zoning District Map. The
zoning districts and boundaries are hereby adopted and established as shown on the District Map,
which map, together with all notations, references, data, district boundaries and other information
thereon, are made a part of the Zoning Code by reference. The Zoning Map, properly attested,
shall remain on file in the office of the Zoning Official or other appropriate Village official.
§ 360-4. Conformity with regulations required.
Except as otherwise provided in this code:
Conformity of buildings and land. No building, structure, or premises shall be used or occupied,
and no buildings or parts thereof or other structure shall be erected, raised, moved, placed,
reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered, except in conformity with the regulations herein
specified for the zoning district in which it is located and as otherwise regulated herein, except as
otherwise specifically provided for by this code.
Conformity of buildings. No building, structure or premises shall be erected, altered or used so as
to produce greater heights, smaller yards or less unoccupied area, and no building shall be
occupied by more families and/or persons than prescribed for such building, structure or premises
for the district in which it is located and as otherwise regulated herein, except as otherwise
specifically provided for by this code.

variances or other lawful permits issued before the effective date of this code.
§ 360-6. Interpretation.
Interpretation of provisions. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this code shall
be held to be minimum requirements. Whenever this code imposes a greater restriction than is
imposed and required by other provisions of law or by other rules or regulations or resolutions, the
provisions of the most restrictive code should govern.
Interpretation of district boundaries.
Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center
lines or street lines of streets, the center lines or alley lines of alleys, or the center lines or
right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map.

right-of-way shall be subject to the zoning regulations of the district in which they are located.

extend to the center of such vacation and all area included in the vacation shall thereafter be
subject to all regulations of the extended districts.
Where any land or territory within the Village is not shown to be located in a district, the
zoning regulations of the most restrictive adjoining district shall govern.

subsequent amendments, by a zoning district boundary line, the requirements of the less
restrictive district adjacent to such line may be extended for that lot, not more than 25 feet into

owner to obtain an opinion from a registered engineer as to the size of lot required for an individual
water and/or sewage system to operate on the lot according to safe health standards. If the findings of
the engineer indicate that larger lots are necessary, the Village Board may require a lot size in excess
of the minimum area defined previously in this section. (See 225 ILCS 225/1 through 225/23.)

district regulations of the district in which it is located, and when so changed to a use of a greater
conformity shall not thereafter be changed to a use of lesser conformity.
A nonconforming use shall not be altered, extended or restored so as to displace any conforming
use.

Any nonconforming use of a building or premises which has been abandoned shall not thereafter
be resumed, and any future use on the premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this

A.
The "Board," when used in this section, shall be construed to mean the Board of Zoning Appeals. The
Board shall consist of seven members appointed by the Mayor by and with the consent of the Village
Board of Trustees. The terms of office shall be five years; provided that the members of the first Board
shall serve respectively for the following terms (or until their respective successors are appointed and
qualified): one for one year, one for two years, one for three years, one for four years, one for five
years, one for six years and one for seven years; and five years each for those following the first
appointment. The Chairman of the Board shall be elected by a majority vote of the membership of the
Board and shall hold his office as Chairman for a one-year term or until his successor is elected by a
majority vote of the membership. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-3.)

its hearings and other official actions; findings of fact shall be included in the minutes of each case of a
request for a variation, special permit or planned building development, and the reason for granting or
denying such application shall be specified. Every rule or regulation, every amendment or repeal
thereof, and every order, requirement and interpretation, decision or determination of the Board shall
be filed immediately in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. The Board shall adopt its
own rules and procedures, not in conflict with this code or with Illinois statutes.
§ 360-58. Appeals.
An appeal may be taken to the Board of Zoning Appeals by any person, firm or corporation, or by any
officer, department, board, or bureau affected by a decision of the building and zoning official to this
code. Such appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the Board of Zoning
Appeals by general rule, by filing with the building and zoning official and with the Board of Zoning
Appeals a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The building and zoning official shall
thereupon transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
building and zoning official certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after the notice of appeal has been
filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of record on
application, or notice to the building and zoning official and on due cause shown. The Board shall
select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give due notice thereof to the
parties and shall render a decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay. Any person may appear
and testify at the hearing, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. The Board may

Variances. To vary or adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this code in the
case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical
conditions, whereby such strict application would result in such practical difficulty and/or
unnecessary hardship as would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or building
involved, but in no other case. In granting any variance, the Board shall prescribe any conditions
that it deems to be necessary or desirable for the public interest, convenience or welfare.
However, any use variance shall be subject to the applicable provisions of § 360-50 of this code,
and no other variance in the application of any provisions of this code shall be granted by the
Board unless it finds:
That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings, applying to
the land or buildings for which the variances are sought, which circumstances or conditions
are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally to the land or buildings in the
neighborhood, and that said circumstances or conditions are such that strict application of the
provisions of this code would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of such land or
building;
That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of the variances is necessary for
the reasonable use of land or buildings, and that the variance as granted by the Board is the
minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose;
That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare. In addition to considering the character and use of adjoining buildings and those in
the vicinity, the Board, in making its findings, shall take into account whether the condition of
the subject premises is peculiar to the lot or tract described in the petition or is merely part of
the general condition of the neighborhood which would appropriately be the proper jurisdiction
of the Village Board of Trustees for consideration of rezoning of the area rather than a
variance which would affect only a small segment of the area.
Permits for variances and special permits. To issue or authorize permits for any of the uses or
matters for which this code allows or requires the obtaining of a variance or special permit from
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
§ 360-60. Procedure.

this code. Four members shall constitute a quorum; and, except as otherwise provided by this
code, an affirmative vote of at least four members shall be necessary to authorize any action of
the Board. All appeals and applications to the Board shall be in writing. Every appeal or
application shall refer to the specific provision of the ordinance involved, and shall exactly set forth
the interpretation that is claimed, the use for which the variance or special permit is sought, or the
details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on which it is claimed that the variance
should be granted, as the case may be.
The Village may appear by any designated official of the Village Board of Trustees, and be heard
as a party in interest in any hearing before the Board, and the Village may appeal any decision of
the Board to a court of competent jurisdiction.
Notice and hearing. No action of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be taken on any case until
after notice has been given that a public hearing has been held as follows:
A notice of the time and date of said hearing and a brief summary of explanation of the

prior to the hearing date.
