     C.      If any council member who is sitting as mayor dies, resigns or otherwise vacates his mayoral position, or if any council member who is about to be appointed mayor dies, resigns or announces that he/she would prefer to continue service on the city council without holding the office of mayor, the members of the city council may, by majority vote, fill the vacancy by electing any council member to fill said un-expired term or full term, whichever is applicable; such election shall be without prejudice to said person serving a full term as mayor when his/her regular turn under these criteria occurs. If no person receives a majority vote, the position of mayor shall be filled by the mayor pro tem, who shall also serve without prejudice to serving a full term as mayor when his/her regular turn under these criteria occurs.

     D.     No person temporarily appointed to fill a vacancy on the city council shall serve as mayor or mayor pro tem during such appointment unless there is no available alternative.

     D.     To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

The substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter. The substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use for other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the provisions of that Code. The substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word state in the phrase retailer engaged in business in this state in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

3.24.020 Definitions.
     Except where the context requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter.

     A.     Hotel. Hotel means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including, but not limited to, dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, condominium, cooperative apartment, duplex and any other type of private residence that is used for rental purposes, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer located outside a mobilehome park for occupancy on a transient basis unless such occupancy is for any period of more than twenty-seven days, or other similar structure or portion thereof subject to the business license provided in Title 5. This section does not authorize the city to levy a tax on the privilege of renting any mobilehome when the tenant is an employee of the owner or operator of the mobilehome.

     B.      Occupancy. Occupancy means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for rent for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes regardless of the purpose for which such rooms are rented.

     C.      Operator. Operator means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter, and shall have jointly and severally the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

     D.     Person. Person means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

     E.      Rent. Rent means the consideration charged or chargeable for the occupancy of space valued in money whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including the full value of receipts, cash, credits, property or service of any nature whatsoever. It is not the intent of this section to make the operator liable for the tax on uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be reported.

     F.      Tax administrator. Tax administrator means director of finance.

     G.     Transient. Transient means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of twenty-seven consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of twenty-seven days has expired. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 253 § 1, 1982; Ord. 100 §§ 58, 59, 1976; Ord. 12 § 2, 1973)

 

3.24.030 Imposition—Rate—Collection.
     For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to, and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due when the transient ceases to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. Tax on occupancies furnished transients which is chargeable but not charged, in exchange for services of any kind, is due and payable to the city by the operator, the amount of tax being determined on the basis of ten percent of the current rental value of the accommodations furnished. (Ord. 530 § 1, 1992; Ord. 410 § 1, 1988; Ord. 153 § 1, 1978; Ord. 12 § 3, 1973)

(Ord. 819 § 4, 2003)

 

3.24.040 Exemptions.
     All employees or officials of any local, state or federal governmental agency shall be exempt from payment of the tax provided by this chapter if such employee or official is on official governmental business. All such persons, including any person determined by the city attorney based on a federal or state statute or case opinion to be exempt from payment of the tax provided by this chapter, shall be required by the operator to complete a transient occupancy tax exemption from, as provided by the city, and the operator shall submit all completed tax exemption forms to the tax administrator pursuant to the tax payment schedule set forth in Section 3.24.070. (Ord. 954 § 1, 2007; Ord. 412 § 1, 1988; Ord. 12 § 4, 1973)

 

3.24.050 Operator—Collection duty.
     Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of the tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator; or that it will not be added to the rent; or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Ord. 12 § 5, 1973)

 

3.24.060 Operator—Registration.
     A.     Every person desiring to engage in or conduct business as operator of a hotel renting to transients within the city shall file with the tax administrator an application for a transient occupancy registration permit for each place of business. Every application for such a permit shall be made upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator and shall set forth the name under which the applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his or her place of business and such other information as the tax administrator may require. The application shall be signed by the owner if a natural person, by a member or partner, if an association or partnership, by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the application in the case of a corporation. The transient occupancy registration permit must be in effect at all times while the business is in operation and shall be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The permit shall, among other things, state the following:

     1.      Name of hotel;

     2.      Name of operator;

     3.      Hotel address;

     4.      The date upon which the permit was issued;

     5.      “This transient occupancy registration permit signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax chapter by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting same tax to the tax administrator. This permit does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business in an unlawful manner, nor operate a hotel without strictly complying with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This permit does not apply in lieu of such other permits which are otherwise required.”

     B.      The city council may, by resolution, establish a registration fee payable by all operators for each permit issued under this section. (Ord. 993 § 1, 2010; Ord. 12 § 6, 1973)

 

3.24.070 Operator—Payment duties.
     A.     The tax imposed under Section 3.24.030 is due and payable to the tax administrator on the first day of the month following the close of the preceding month and becomes delinquent on the first day of the second succeeding calendar month. If the operator elects to do so, instead of reporting on a calendar-month basis, he or she may use thirteen twenty-eight-day reporting periods for each year. In that event, the tax becomes delinquent on the twenty-eighth day of the next succeeding reporting period.

     B.      Return of Tax. Each operator shall, on or before the thirtieth day following the close of each reporting period, make a return to the tax administrator on forms provided by him or her of the total rents charged or chargeable as provided in Section 3.24.030, whether or not received, including any rents charged for occupancy exempted under the provisions of Sections 3.24.020(D) and 3.24.040. The amount of the tax collected for transient occupancy shall be fully itemized per each property rented. Amounts claimed on the return as exempt from the tax shall be fully itemized and explained on the return or supporting schedule. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax due shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish other reporting periods for any operator and may require a cash deposit or bond for any permit holders if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collections of the tax, and he or she may require further information in the return. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the city. The operator shall establish a separate checking or savings account for the deposit of those taxes collected for the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator.

     C.      Cessation of Business. Each operator shall notify the tax administrator ten days prior to the sale or cessation of business for any reason, and returns and payments are due immediately upon the sale or cessation of business. (Ord. 1096 § 2, 2015; Ord. 302 § 1, 1984; Ord. 174 § 1, 1979; Ord. 41 § 1, 1974; Ord. 12 § 7, 1973)

 

3.24.080 Delinquency and fraud—Penalties.
     A.     Any operator who fails to pay any tax to the city or any amount of tax required to be collected and paid to the city, including amounts based on determinations made by the tax administrator under Section 3.24.090 of this chapter, within the time required, shall pay a penalty of fifteen percent of the tax plus interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax or the amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable to the city until the date of payment. Any operator who fails to remit any penalty imposed under this section within ten days after receipt of notice thereof shall pay interest thereon at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the date on which the penalty becomes due and payable to the city until the date of payment.

     B.      If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to misrepresentation or fraud, a penalty of one hundred percent of this amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsection A of this section. (Ord. 402 § 1, 1988; Ord. 12 § 8, 1973)

 

3.24.090 Failure to collect, report and maintain separate checking/savings account—Penalty assessed—Determination by tax administrator—Notice to operator.
     A.     If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and maintain a separate checking or savings account of the tax money held in trust for the city and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. Failure to maintain a separate savings or checking account for the tax due in trust for the city shall result in an assessment of five hundred dollars in penalties. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known address.

     B.      Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be so due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.24.100. (Ord. 302 § 2, 1984; Ord. 12 § 9, 1973)

 

3.24.100 Determination by tax administrator—Appeal.
     A.     Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of any tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving of the assessment or determination of tax and penalties, if any due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to the operator at his or her last known address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.

     B.      No payment is required as a condition of appealing any decision to the city council as provided in subsection A. However, any challenge to the city council’s final determination brought before any court of competent jurisdiction shall be subject to the payment requirements found in Chapter 3.60. (Ord. 995 § 2, 2010; Ord. 12 § 10, 1973)

 

3.24.110 Operator—Recordkeeping duties.
     It is the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, in the city, for a period of three years, records in such form as the tax administrator may require to determine the amount of such tax. The tax administrator shall have the right to inspect such records at all reasonable times and may subpoena the records of any operator who refuses to make them available for examination. (Ord. 12 § 11, 1973)

 

3.24.120 Refund—Procedure—Conditions.
     A.     Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claims shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

     B.      An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credit to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

     C.      A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

     D.     No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records. (Ord. 12 § 12, 1973)

 

3.24.130 Remedy—Applicability of Sections 3.24.140 through 3.24.210.

3.24.140 Remedy—Revocation of permit.
     A.     Whenever any operator fails to comply with any provision of this chapter relating to occupancy tax or any rule or regulation of the tax administrator relating to occupancy tax prescribed and adopted under this chapter, the tax administrator upon hearing, after giving the operator ten days’ notice in writing specifying the time and place of hearing and requiring him to show cause why his permit or permits should not be revoked, may suspend or revoke any one or more of the permits held by the operator.

     B.      The tax administrator shall give to the operator written notice of the suspension or revocation of any of his permits. The notice herein required may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.

     C.      The tax administrator shall not issue a new permit after the revocation of a permit unless he is satisfied that the former holder of the permit will comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to the occupancy tax and regulations of the tax administrator. During the period of time while such a permit is suspended, revoked or otherwise not validly in effect, the tax administrator may require that the operation be closed. (Ord. 12 § 13(A), 1973)

 

3.24.150 Remedy—Certificate of record—Lien.
     A.     If any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter is not paid when due, the tax administrator may, within three years after the amount is due, file for record in the office of the Riverside County recorder, a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the operator liable for the same and the fact that the tax administrator has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid.

     B.      From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be paid together with penalties and interest constitutes a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the operator or, afterwards and before the lien expires, acquired by him. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. (Ord. 12 § 13(B), 1973)

 

3.24.160 Remedy—Priorities of satisfaction.
     The amounts required to be paid by an operator under this chapter with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases:

     A.     Whenever the person is insolvent;

     B.      Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his assets;

     C.      Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors, administrators, or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased;

     D.     Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied upon by process of law. This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien.

     The preference given to the city by this section shall be subordinate to the preference given to claims for personal services by Sections 1204 and 1206 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. 12 § 13(C), 1973)

 

3.24.170 Remedy—Warrant for collection.
     At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount required to be paid in this chapter or within three years after the last recording of a certificate under Section 3.24,140(A), the tax administrator may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any sheriff, marshal or constable and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy of and a sale pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator may pay or advance to the sheriff, marshal or constable the same fees, commissions and expenses for his services pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator, and not the court, shall approve the fees for publication in a newspaper. (Ord. 12 § 13(D), 1973)

 

3.24.180 Remedy—Seizure and Sale.
     At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount, the tax administrator may forthwith collect the amount in the following manner: The tax administrator shall seize any property, real or personal, of the operator and sell the property, or a sufficient part of it, at public auction to pay the amount due together with any penalties and interest imposed for the delinquency and any costs incurred on account of the seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect occupancy taxes due shall be only of property of the operator not exempt from execution under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. 12 § 13(E), 1973)

 

3.24.190 Successor’s liability—Withholding by purchaser required.
     If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out his business or quits the business, his successor or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. (Ord. 12 § 13(F), 1973)

 

3.24.200 Liability of purchaser—Release.
     If the purchaser of a hotel fails to withhold purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty days from the date the former owner’s records are made available for audit, whichever period expires later, but in any event not later than ninety days after receiving the request, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the tax administrator to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later. (Ord. 12 § 13(G), 1973)

 

3.24.210 Tax constitutes debt—Liability— Action by city.
     Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by the operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 12 § 13(H), 1973)

 

3.24.220 Extension of time when—Authority.
     The tax administrator, for good cause, may extend for not to exceed one month the time for making any return or paying any amount, required to be paid under this chapter. The extension may be granted at any time, provided a request therefor is filed with the tax administrator within or prior to the period for which the extension may be granted. Any person to whom an extension is granted shall pay, in addition to the tax, interest at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof from the date on which the tax would have been due without the extension, until the date of payment. (Ord. 12 § 15, 1973)

 

3.24.230 Divulging of information prohibited.
     It is unlawful for any person having an administrative duty under this chapter to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an investigation of the records of any operator or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof set forth or disclosed in any return, or to knowingly permit any return or copy thereof or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person. Successors, receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, may be given information as to the items included in the amounts of any unpaid tax or amount of tax, penalties and interest required to be collected. (Ord. 12 § 16, 1973)

 

3.24.240 Collection—Joint agreement.
     The city is empowered to enter into a joint powers agreement with other cities and the county of Riverside, and if such agreement or agreements can be made wherein central collection for the county of Riverside is provided, then it shall be done upon approval by the city council. (Ord. 12 § 18, 1973)

 

3.24.250 Violation—Penalty.
     It is a violation and shall be punishable according to the provisions of Title 14 of this Municipal Code:

Failure of the owner, the owner’s authorized agent or representative and/or the owner’s designated local contact person to respond to calls or complaints regarding the condition, operation, or conduct of occupants and/or guests of the short-term rental in a timely and appropriate manner shall be subject to all administrative, legal and equitable remedies available to the city.

     M.     The owner, the owner’s authorized agent or representative and/or the owner’s designated local contact person shall report to the city manager, or designee, the name, violation, date, and time of disturbance of each person involved in three or more disorderly conduct activities, disturbances or other violations of any applicable law, rule or regulation pertaining to the use and occupancy of the subject short-term rental.

All requests must be in writing and shall identify how the strict application of the standard conditions creates an unreasonable hardship to a property such that, if the requirement is not modified, reasonable use of the property by occupants or their guests for short-term rental purposes would not be allowed. Any hardships identified must relate to physical constraints to the subject property and shall not be self-induced or economic. Any modifications of the standard conditions shall not further exacerbate an already existing problem.

Before any event or gathering that involves groups that exceed the maximum number of occupants allowed during the daytime may take place at a property, either the owner or the owner’s authorized agent or representative shall apply, on behalf of the responsible person and/or occupants, for a special event permit pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter 5.12 of this code, at least thirty days prior to any such gathering or event, unless otherwise authorized by the city manager or designee.

     B.      The total number of vehicles permitted for any duly approved short-term rental shall not exceed the total number of bedrooms set forth in the respective short-term rental certificate.

 

     C.      The owner, the owner’s authorized agent or representative, or responsible person shall immediately provide the license plate numbers for all vehicles associated with a given short-term rental unit to any agent of the city upon request. (Ord. 1174 § 2, 2020; Ord. 1139 § 2, 2018)

     The owner or the owner’s authorized agent or representative shall maintain for a period of three years, records in such form as the tax administrator (as defined in Chapter 3.24 of this code) may require to determine the amount of transient occupancy tax owed to the city. The tax administrator shall have the right to inspect such records at all reasonable times, which may be subject to the subpoena by the city council pursuant to Section 2.02.220 (Subpoena authority) of Chapter 2.02 (City Council) of this code.

     D.     Prohibited Short-Term Rental Use. If credible evidence is presented to the city, after issuance of a short-term rental certificate, that there are private governing documents, including, without limitation, conditions, covenants and restrictions (“CC&Rs”) that are valid and enforceable pursuant to the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act, as set forth in California Civil Code Section 4000 et seq., which prohibit the use of the owner’s single-family dwelling or condominium for short-term rental purposes, as defined in this chapter, regardless of any exemption from such governing document(s) restriction under applicable law, including, without limitation, California Civil Code Section 4740, the owner shall have thirty days after being notified of receipt of such evidence by the city to provide written authorization from the owner’s homeowner association that allows the owner to continue to use the owner’s property for short-term rental purposes until expiration of the current short-term rental certificate.

Chapter 3.28 LICENSE TAX ON NEW CONSTRUCTION
Note
*      Prior ordinance history: Ords. 32, 69, 155, 233, 326, 371 § 4, 512, 517, 549, 557, 581 and 620.

 

3.28.010 Purpose and intent.
     The city council declares that the license taxes required to be paid hereby are assessed pursuant to Section 37101 of the Government Code of the state of California and the taxing power of the city and solely for the purpose of producing revenue. This chapter is not adopted for regulatory purposes. The continued development of the city, with the consequent increase in population and in the use of public facilities, has imposed increased requirements for such facilities, including, but not limited to, parks and recreational facilities, major street improvements, bus shelters, traffic signals, storm drains, bridges and public buildings (such as fire stations, police facilities, maintenance facilities, libraries and general offices). The necessity for such facilities results directly from new construction and the need cannot be met from ordinary city revenues. The most practical and equitable method of paying for such facilities is to impose a tax upon new construction in the city. (Ord. 703 § 1, 1998; Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)

 

3.28.020 Definitions.
     For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:

     “Dwelling unit” includes each single-family dwelling and each habitation unit of an apartment, duplex or multiple-dwelling structure designed as a separate place for habitation.

     “Gross floor area” means the total area of all floors in an enclosed building measured from the outside surface of building walls.

     “Mobilehome space” means each space, area or building, in a trailer park or mobilehome park or other place designed or intended as a place to accommodate any mobilehome, trailer, van, bus or other vehicle or mobile structure, at a time when the same is being used as living or sleeping quarters for human beings.

     “Person” includes every individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, trust, corporation or any other group engaging in construction activities itself or through the services of any employee, agent or independent contractor. (Ord. 703 § 1, 1998; Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)

 

3.28.030 Imposition of tax—Amount.
     A.     In addition to any other fee, license or tax required by this code, every person constructing or causing to be constructed or erected any building or structure in the city for which a building permit is required, shall pay a license tax in the amount not to exceed one dollar and forty-six cents per square foot of gross floor area under roof.

     B.      For each mobilehome space, five hundred dollars with no additional sum for any directly accessory structure.

     C.      For the alteration of residential structures, not including a second kitchen or more than two bedrooms, or mobilehome parks, the license tax shall be computed prorated only on the additional gross floor area in excess of five hundred square feet up to a total of seven hundred fifty square feet, if any, resulting from the alteration; and for the alteration of other buildings or structures and residential additions in excess of seven hundred fifty square feet, the license tax shall be computed only upon all the additional gross floor area, if any, resulting from the alteration.

     D.     Notwithstanding the tax rate established in subsection A of this section, the city council may by resolution authorize the collection of a lesser amount of tax than that provided for in subsection A of this section. The resolution authorizing the collection of a lesser amount of tax shall state the time period for which it is effective. (Ord. 703 § 1, 1998; Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)

 

3.28.040 Time and place of payment.
     The license taxes imposed pursuant to Section 3.28.030 shall be due and payable at the Building Division, Rancho Mirage, California, upon issuance of the building permit. However, for any new construction projects for which a building permit is not required, the license taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be paid prior to the issuance of any ministerial permit, including, but not limited to, grading permits or grading plans, for any development activity associated with the construction or development of any portion of the subject project. The tax for a mobilehome space shall be paid prior to the issuance of the first permit for the construction of such space or if such construction is performed without a permit, at the time when construction is commenced. No permit shall issue until the tax is paid. (Ord. 938 § 2, 2006; Ord. 703 § 1, 1998; Ord. 670 § 1 (Exh. A, 1997)

 

3.28.050 Refunds.
     If a permit for construction work expires or if such permit is revoked and if during the one hundred twenty days following the expiration or revocation date of the permit the permittee files written application for a refund in the office of the building official, there shall be a refund of the entire tax paid. There shall be no refund if any construction work has been performed nor shall there be any partial refund.

The reimbursement shall not reduce any other development specific exaction, mitigation, local impact fee imposed by the city or any other agency.

     B.      Reimbursements shall be provided annually by the city following a calculation of license tax payments for the preceding fiscal year for eligible public facilities installed by the developer and accepted by the city.

Refunds shall be granted subject to the rules and regulations established by the Commission.

     F.      Automatic Annual LDMF Adjustment. The LDMF set forth in this section shall be revised annually by means of an automatic adjustment at the beginning of each fiscal year based on the average percentage change over the previous calendar year set forth in the Consumer Price Index for “All Urban Consumers” in the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside Area, measured as of the month of December in the calendar year which ends in the previous fiscal year.

     9.      Kennels and catteries established in connection with an existing single-family residential unit and as defined in Title 17 of this Municipal Code.

     a.      Completion of required infrastructure improvements including, but not limited to, underground utilities, exterior project area walls, streets and curbs and issuance of at least one building permit for a discrete primary structure, such as a single-family home, prior to October 1, 2008 (date of MSHCP permit approval).

     b.      Continuous construction activity since October 1, 2008, as demonstrated by issuance of a building permit for a discrete primary structure and/or a certificate of occupancy permit for a discrete primary structure in each six-month period between October 1, 2008, and April 1, 2011.

     c.      City registration of the project and proposed lots to be exempted, in accordance with the Commission’s procedures, by September 1, 2011.

     Projects not meeting the standard exemption criteria above, that made verifiable payments, as part of a legal settlement, to specifically fund acquisition of habitat for a species listed as “endangered” under the federal Endangered Species Act are required to pay the LDMF but are eligible to receive a refund, on a pro rata per acre basis based on the actual acreage being assessed the fee. Any such projects and proposed lots to be exempted must be registered in accordance with the Commission’s procedures by September 1, 2011.

     H.     Fee Credits.

     1.      The city may grant to owners or developers of real property, a credit against the LDMF that would otherwise be charged pursuant to this section, for the dedication of land within an MSHCP conservation area, provided, however, that no credit shall be given unless: (a) the dedication is secured by a conservation easement acceptable to a grantee legally authorized to accept and hold such easements pursuant to Civil Code Section 815.3 or pursuant to other legal instrument that ensures the area will be conserved in perpetuity; (b) the land to be dedicated is appropriate for conservation and dedication thereof is consistent with and furthers the goals of the MSHCP; and (c) the dedication and credit complies with all procedures and policies of the Commission.

     2.      An applicant for a proposed project may apply for credit to reduce the amount of the LDMF required to be paid prior to approval of the project. Any credit granted and the amount of the LDMF to be paid shall be included as a condition of approval of the project. However, if an applicant has already received approval from the city and has not previously applied for a credit to reduce the amount of the LDMF required to be paid, an applicant may apply for such credit at any time prior to issuance of a grading permit for the project and any credit granted shall in that case be included as a condition of approval of the grading permit issued for the project.

     I.       Compliance.

     1.      Failure to pay the LDMF due under this section shall constitute a debt to the city. An action for the collection thereof may be commenced in the name of the city in any court having jurisdiction of the cause.

     2.      It shall be a public nuisance to engage in any construction activity without paying the LDMF due pursuant to this section.

If a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a development permit, to construct a public facility for which Impact Fees are assessed and the size, length or capacity of the public facility is determined by the city to be in excess over that needed for the impacts of that development, the developer may be entitled to a reimbursement or credit.

     B.      Nothing in this section shall relieve any developer from paying any other fees that are not subject to the reimbursement agreement, or any other fees, exactions or taxes required by any applicable federal, state, or local law, rule or regulation. (Ord. 881 § 3, 2004)

     B.      Prior to amending any impact fee, the city council shall review and consider all aspects of the city’s Impact Fee Study, and any subsequent fee studies. Any such adjustments in the fees will be prospective only and will become effective as of the date specified in any such resolution. (Ord. 881 § 3, 2004)

 

3.29.170 Automatic fee adjustments.
     The Director shall make annual adjustments to the amount of each fee to account for the escalation in construction costs, based upon the figures published in the Engineering News Record’s Building Cost and/or Construction Cost Indices.

     C.      It shall be a public nuisance to engage in any construction activity without paying all applicable impact fees due pursuant to this chapter.

     D.     It shall be an infraction violation to engage in any construction activity without paying all applicable impact fees due pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 881 § 3, 2004)

3.34.065 Exemption from formal and informal bidding procedures and adoption of prices obtained by other public agencies.
     A.     The formal and informal bidding requirements of this chapter shall not apply when the city is able to enter into a public works contract with a contractor pursuant to pricing and terms that have been previously established by another governmental entity (“participating public agency”), provided that the director of public works, with the consent of the city manager, finds that:

     1.      The contract with the contractor is the result of competitive bidding or negotiation and is made in compliance with the competitive bid or proposal requirements of the participating public agency devoid of fraud perpetrated by any public official or staff, or collusion or fraud among the contractor or any subcontractor, all of which determination is solely based on a thorough and complete investigation and review of all relevant documents, including, but not limited to, all bid documents and specifications, staff reports and approved minutes, it being understood that certain evidence extrinsic to such documents may not be readily available nor accessible to the public works director and city manager; and

     2.      The contract awarded by the participating public agency was awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, in compliance with the Public Contract Code; and

     3.      The purchase conforms to the city’s contract specifications; and

 

     4.      The estimated price of the purchase is lower than that estimated for the purchase if made directly by the city pursuant to other sections of this chapter; and

     5.      The participating public agency’s bid documents contain a provision notifying contractors that the price bid by each contractor, if awarded the contract, shall be made available to other public agencies such as the city of Rancho Mirage.

     B.      If staff finds that there was a protest or claim filed by any losing bidder, a more complete review of the participating public agency’s bidding process shall be ordered by the city manager, and the city shall not dispense with the formal and informal bidding requirements of this chapter unless and until the director of public works, with the consent of the city manager, makes all the findings set forth in subsection A. (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 941 § 3, 2006)

 

3.34.070 Opening of bids—Award or rejection of contract.
     A.     In accordance with Public Contract Code Section 22038, at the time provided in the notice inviting bids, all bids timely received shall be opened, evaluated and, unless all bids are rejected, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.

     B.      If two or more bids are the same and the lowest, the city may accept the one it chooses. If no bids are received through the formal or informal procedure, the project may be performed by employees of the city by force account or by negotiated contract.

     C.      The city may, in its discretion, reject all bids presented, by following the procedures specified at Public Contract Code Section 22038. If after the first invitation of bids all bids are rejected, after reevaluating its cost estimates of the project, the city council may elect to either abandon the project, re-advertise the project, or by passage of a resolution by a four-fifths majority of the city council declaring the project can be performed more economically by its employees, the city may have the project done by force account. (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 941 § 3, 2006)

 

3.34.075 Grounds for rejecting public bids.
     The grounds for which the city attorney may recommend the rejection of bids to the city council may include the following:

     A.     Responsive and responsible bids that do not represent the lowest total cost estimate of the project.

     B.      Failure to conform to the specifications and requirements of the bid proposal form, including, but not limited to, errors, omissions, defects and/or irregularities, shall be rejected as nonresponsive bids. The city may, but is not required to, waive any minor deviations that do not materially affect the amount of the bid or result in an unfair competitive advantage in the bidding process.

     C.      Bids that do not demonstrate the requisite trustworthiness, quality, fitness, capacity and/or experience to satisfactorily perform the particular requirements of the proposed work shall be rejected as nonresponsible. Elements of a nonresponsible bid may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:

     1.      Lack of or insufficient experience and/or qualifications of bidder or subcontractor(s) to perform the proposed work.

     2.      Lack of or insufficient financial resources of bidder.

     3.      Unsatisfactory references or work on previous city projects or other public projects.

     4.      Lack of or expired licenses or license designations of the bidder or subcontractor(s) required to perform the proposed work.

     5.      History of bidder’s surety experience.

     6.      History of bidder’s insurance losses and/or workers’ accidental deaths.

     7.      Bidder’s credit history.

     8.      Delegation of work to subcontractor(s) exceeding fifty percent of the total proposed work.

     9.      History of violations with state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Department of Industrial Relations, the Contractors State License Board, and the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal OSHA). (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 941 § 3, 2006)

 

3.34.080 Maintenance work.
     Maintenance work, as defined by the Act, may, at the discretion of the city manager, be performed by city employees by force account or by an outside contractor. (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 941 § 3, 2006)

 

3.34.090 Emergency contracting procedures.
     A.     In accordance with Public Contract Code Section 22035, in cases of emergency when repair or replacements are necessary, the city council may proceed to replace or repair any public facility without adopting plans, specifications, strain sheets, or working details, or giving notice for bids to let contracts. The work may be done by day labor under the direction of the city council, by contractor, or by a combination of both.

     B.      If notice for bids to let contracts is not provided as a result of an emergency, the city shall follow the emergency procedures set forth at Public Contract Code Section 22050. (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 941 § 3, 2006)

 

3.34.105 Prevailing wages.
     A.     This section is applicable to all state and locally funded public works projects except the following, which are expressly exempt from the payment of prevailing wages by Section 1782 of the California Labor Code:

     1.      City public works projects with contracts awarded prior to January 1, 2015, including the amendment, renewal or extension of such contracts;

     2.      City public projects advertised for bid prior to January 1, 2015;

     3.      City public works projects involving construction activities with contracts valued at twenty-five thousand dollars or less; and

     4.      City public works projects involving alteration, demolition, repair, and maintenance activities with contracts valued at fifteen thousand dollars or less.

     B.      All public works projects not otherwise exempt from this section or any other applicable law or regulation shall be subject to California’s prevailing wage laws (Labor Code Section 1770 et seq.). Any notice inviting bids for such public works projects shall include notification of the provisions of this section. (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1087 § 3, 2014)

 

3.34.110 Design/build contracts for selected city projects.
     A.     The city shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any state law pertaining to the bidding, awarding and/or administration of a public works contract otherwise applicable to a particular project, if the city council concludes that the city’s interests would best be served by entering into a negotiated design/build contract for the project’s construction.

     B.      The city council’s conclusion for a design/build contract should be based upon supportive findings that the proposed design/build contract will: (1) provide for realistic and accurate budget estimates at the start of the planning process and thus contribute to more effective budget management; (2) avoid the delays and costly change orders that result from the traditional design-bid-build method of contracting; and (3) allow the city council to consider the overall design, aesthetic, and quality standards of the project’s design. (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 941 § 3, 2006)

 

3.34.120 Splitting.
     It is unlawful to split or separate into smaller work orders or projects any project for the purpose of evading the provisions of this chapter requiring work to be done by contract after competitive bidding. (Ord. 1151 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1117 § 2, 2017; Ord. 941 § 3, 2006)

Chapter 3.40 TRANSPORTATION UNIFORM MITIGATION FEE
3.40.010 Purpose, use and findings.
     The city council finds and determines as follows:

     A.     The city is a member agency of the Coachella Valley Association of Governments (“CVAG”), a joint powers agency consisting of public agencies situated in the Coachella Valley (collectively, “Member Agencies”).

     B.      Acting in concert, the member agencies developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional system of highways and arterials within CVAG’s jurisdiction (the “Regional System”) could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee (“TUMF”) imposed on future residential, commercial and industrial development within the jurisdiction.

     C.      That CVAG commissioned the preparation of various studies (“Fee Studies”) which evaluated population and employment growth, future transportation needs and the availability of traditional transportation funding sources to establish updated TUMF levels and program revenue collection targets.

     D.     That the fee studies, as periodically updated, make it possible to determine a reasonable relationship between the cumulative regional impacts of new land development projects in the Coachella Valley on the regional system and the need to mitigate these transportation impacts using funds levied through the TUMF program.

5.12.010 Purpose.
     The purpose of this chapter is to preserve the peace and tranquility of the city’s residential neighborhoods by regulating certain special events within the city’s residential neighborhoods in a manner that effectively avoids or mitigates the negative secondary effects that some special events have on traffic flow, traffic congestion, air quality, noise, light, glare, health, safety, security, aesthetics, pets, etc. in areas of the city zoned for residential use.

Chapter 5.20 REAL ESTATE AUCTION
5.20.010 Purpose of provisions.
     Real estate auctions create unique problems for the city as compared with other auctions or the sale of real estate in normal course. In addition, the connotation of a real estate auction is demeaning to the image of the city and projects a false image and perception of real estate value within the city, economic market conditions and aesthetic quality of Rancho Mirage. The city has a public interest in preserving the quality of the image of Rancho Mirage. A real estate auction brings to the city traffic problems, facilities problems and detrimentally interferes with the contractual relations between the city and the developer. Individual private residential communities have inadequate parking, circulation on and off site and physical facilities necessary to accommodate an auction. The privacy and security of these private communities is severely compromised by hundreds of individuals springing upon these private walled residential areas. The city has experienced the difficulty in obtaining project completion when dealing with the numerous and sudden new homeowners in a project where the original agreement for construction of improvements was with the developer no longer present or interested after the sudden sale. As a result of these concerns, the regulation of real estate auctions is necessary to secure the public health, safety and welfare of the city. (Ord. 471 § 1, 1990)

 

5.20.020 Definitions.
     A real estate auction includes all activity prefatory to and the public sale of more than one parcel or unit of real property to the highest bidder by one licensed or authorized to sell real estate in such a manner. Real estate auction does not include the sale of a single parcel pursuant to court order or California law pertaining to nonjudicial foreclosure. (Ord. 471 § 2, 1990)

 

5.20.030 Permit—Required.
     No person may assist in, make preparations for, participate in, operate, advertise for, or sell real estate at auction without first obtaining a nontransferable permit for that activity. The permit shall be issued and approved by the city and the city council. A permit shall also be required if the auction is held outside of Rancho Mirage. (Ord. 471 § 3, 1990)

 

5.20.040 Permit—Issuance conditions.
     As a condition to issuance of any real estate auction permit, the following shall be required:

     A.     A real estate auction permit may only be issued for auctions to be held within the RH (Resort Hotel) zone.

     B.      All auctions shall be held in an indoor location.

     C.      The time and manner of inspection of the real estate to be auctioned shall be established within the terms of the permit for any property to be sold. On the day of the auction, a multipassenger vehicle must be provided for access to and inspection of the real property to be auctioned. Prior to and including the day of the auction no more than two, six passenger automobiles or twelve prospective purchasers per residential unit may be allowed at the property site at any one time for inspection and a maximum of one hundred persons.

     D.     The development project of which the real property to be auctioned is a portion must have complied with or provide security satisfactory to the city sufficient to secure all conditions of any development permit issued.

     E.      The city may impose any condition reasonably related to mitigate any impact of the auction activity upon the residential area within which the auctioned property is located and/or the city in general. (Ord. 471 § 4, 1990)

 

5.20.050 Permit—Fee.
     A permit fee of five hundred dollars shall be paid prior to issuance of the auction permit. (Ord. 460 § 1, 1990)

 

5.20.060 Permit—Application.
     The application shall state:

     A.     Applicant’s name, business address, telephone and facsimile number. If applicant is a partnership or corporation, include the name of the responsible person for purposes of the application and the name of the person authorized to accept service on behalf of the entity within the state of California;

     B.      Addresses of the real property to be auctioned;

     C.      Location, date and hours of the auction and inspection time for real estate;

     D.     Number of individuals expected to be at the auction as either customers, spectators or participants;

     E.      Transportation made available for transfer of the auction participants and/or customers from the location of the auction to and from the inspection site of the real property to be auctioned;

     B.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the animal services officer has probable cause to believe that the keeping or maintaining of any animal is so dangerous as to require immediate inspection to safeguard the life or safety of the animal, other animals, or the public, he or she shall have the right to immediately enter and inspect such property, and may use any reasonable means required to effect such entry and make such inspection, whether such property be occupied or unoccupied and whether or not permission to inspect has been obtained.

Beekeeping training and membership is encouraged to promote recognized best management practices.

     5.      A beekeeper shall maintain adequate records and best management practices and proof of re-queening every two years. These records may be required by the Community Developer Director in response to a nuisance complaint as defined by this section.

     3.      Beehive colonies shall be located at least ten feet from all property lines.

     4.      In order to ensure the appropriate height of the honey bee flight path, beehive colony entrances shall face away from the nearest property line(s).

     E.      Hive Management Requirements.

     1.      Beehive colonies shall be continually managed to provide adequate living space for their resident bees to prevent swarming.

     2.      Beehive colonies shall be re-queened at least once every two years to prevent swarming.

Chapter 7.07 RECYCLING AND DIVERSION OF DEBRIS FROM CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION
7.07.010 Findings and purpose.
     A.     The city council of the city of Rancho Mirage finds and determines that the city is committed to protecting the public health, safety, welfare, and environment, and that in order to meet these goals, it is necessary that the city promote the public purposes served by this chapter and adopt the following regulations pursuant to these findings.

     B.      The city finds that the state of California, through its California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939, the “Act”), required that each local jurisdiction in the state divert 50% of discarded materials (base year 1990, state methodology) from landfill by December 31, 2000, and thereafter maintain or exceed that diversion rate.

     C.      The city finds that every local jurisdiction, city and county in California, including the city of Rancho Mirage faces fines up to $10,000 a day for not meeting the above mandated goal.

     D.     The city finds that reusing and recycling construction and demolition debris is essential to further the city’s efforts to reduce waste and comply with the goals of the Act.

     E.      The city finds that construction and demolition debris waste reduction and recycling have been proven to reduce the amount of material that is landfilled, has been proven to increase site and worker safety and to be cost effective.

     F.      The city finds that the commitment to the reduction of waste and compliance with state law requires the establishment of programs for recycling and salvaging construction and demolition materials.

     G.     The city finds that requiring demolition and construction debris to be recycled and reused may in some respects add modestly to the cost of demolition and construction and in other respects may make possible some cost recovery and cost reduction.

     H.     The city finds that, except in unusual circumstances, it is feasible and reasonable for parties who generate debris to divert and recycle construction and demolition debris from construction, demolition, and renovation projects to the maximum extent feasible. (Ord. 918 §2, 2006)

7.07.070 Reporting.
     A.     To the extent practical, as determined by the compliance official, all construction and demolition debris, whether landfilled or diverted, shall be weighed in compliance with all regulatory requirements in effect at the time relating to accuracy and maintenance of weighing equipment.

     A.     Prior to commencing demolition or construction, an applicant wishing relief may seek an exception, partial or complete, from the requirements of this chapter through the process described in this section. This section is supplemental to Section 7.07.050 insofar as it exempts the applicant from compliance with Section 7.07.040 under appropriate circumstances. However, the exception procedure involves the exercise of discretion by the compliance officer for projects that would otherwise, from their nature and size, fall within the requirements of this chapter.

     B.      This exception process shall be initiated by the filing of an exception application with the compliance official. The compliance official shall determine the completeness of the exception application within five business days of the filing of the application.

     C.      Following consideration of the exception application, the compliance official shall either make the required findings and take action on the application or shall state why the findings cannot be made and deny the application. A decision on the application shall be rendered within ten business days following determination that the application is complete.

     D.     All of the following findings must be made prior to the approval of an exception:

     1.      There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the project that do not apply generally to similar projects;

     2.      Granting the application will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations imposed on like projects; and

     3.      Cost to the applicant of strict compliance with this chapter is not the primary reason for granting the exception. (Ord. 918 §2, 2006)

     2.

The decision of the city council of all protests and objections to the report which may be made shall be final and conclusive.

     4.      The total cost for abating such nuisance, as confirmed by the city council, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates, and upon recordation in the office of the county recorder of a notice of assessment, as so made and confirmed, shall constitute an assessment on the property for the amount of such assessment.

     a.      After such confirmation and recordation, a copy shall be filed with the assessor and tax collector of the county, acting for the city, in order that the county officials may add the amounts of the respective assessment to the next regular tax bills levied against the respective lots and parcels of land.

(Ord. 773 § 1, 2002)

 

8.60.050 Procedures and fees for obtaining a certificate of compliance.
     A.     The property owner or owners authorized agent, at their option, may personally review official files located in the division of building and safety and obtain a copy of the sanitary sewer connection permit if issued on the property. Such sanitary sewer connection permit shall have a final inspection sign-off by a duly authorized city building inspector and shall not be revoked or expired. If the building official confirms and approves the sanitary sewer connection permit, the building official shall execute and authorize the recordation of a certificate of compliance with the Riverside County recorders office.

     If granted, such certificate of temporary exception shall allow for the sale of the property, even though the property is not connected to a public sanitary sewer.

     A certificate of temporary exception shall only be issued when, in the opinion of the building official, due to special circumstances, the cost of connecting the building(s) to the public sanitary sewer would constitute an undue hardship on the property owner. A certificate of temporary exception shall only authorize one sale. Thereafter, the purchaser must obtain either a certificate of compliance or another certificate of temporary exception before selling the property again.

     I.       The library and observatory’s computer workstations are set up for optimal usage by a single individual.

However, if the activities of a group interfere with the effective use of the library and observatory by others, group members will be asked to correct the behavior, or leave the computer area. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.030 Computers—Internet and hyperlink use policy.
     Public access to the internet is free and available on all the library and observatory’s computer devices that the library and observatory have designated for public use. The library and observatory also offers free wireless access to patrons who prefer to work in the facility on their personal devices.

     The library and observatory computers and internet connection are not operating on a secured network. The library and observatory also does not warrant that its website, the server that makes it available, or any links from its site to other websites are free of viruses or other harmful components.

     The library and observatory provides free and open access, via the internet, to informational, educational, recreational, and cultural resources to serve the diverse needs of patrons of all ages and backgrounds. The internet, as an information resource enables the library and observatory to provide information beyond the confines of its own physical collection. Because of its international character, the internet is an unregulated medium of information. As such, while it offers a wealth of excellent information, it also enables access to some material that may be controversial, unreliable, misleading, personally offensive, or illegal under U.S. law.

     The library and observatory acknowledges the First Amendment right to access constitutionally protected materials through the internet, using the library and observatory’s public access computers. The library and observatory does not support, approve, condone or sanction all content that can be found on the internet. As such, the library and observatory does not filter internet access except when it pertains to protecting library and observatory equipment from malware, which includes malicious software, Trojan horses, spyware and potential computer viruses and worms.

     The library and observatory’s home page, accessed at www.ranchomiragelibrary.org, is designed and maintained by library and observatory staff. The library and observatory’s home page features hyperlinks to an endless number of internet sites. When accessing a hyperlink from the library and observatory’s home page, patrons should note the following:

     A.     The library and observatory is not responsible for the content or changes in the content of any hyperlinks.

     B.      The library and observatory does not control or limit access to any hyperlinks which may contain controversial, illegal or offensive material.

     C.      The library and observatory does not censor the contents of any hyperlinks.

     D.     The library and observatory does not warrant that hyperlinks are free of viruses, worms or other harmful components.

     E.      The library and observatory does not retain records of any patron’s use of hyperlinks.

     The library and observatory strives to balance the rights of patrons to access various types of information resources with the rights of users to work in a public environment free from disruptive sounds and graphic visual images. There are information resources on the internet that are accessible through hyperlinks some may find disruptive or offensive for viewing in an open public setting. Because the library and observatory is a public place shared by people of all ages, sensitivities and cultural backgrounds, the library and observatory staff reserves the right to terminate a patron’s internet or computer use at any time another patron complains that the patron’s use of a hyperlink is displaying images and/or creating any sounds or noises that are disruptive or offensive. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.032 Computers—Unacceptable use.

Patrons are financially liable for any damage caused either directly or indirectly to any equipment or software belonging to the library and observatory.

     Unacceptable use includes, but is not limited to, the following:

     A.     Using the internet for illegal activities, including, but not limited to, using the internet to make, create, solicit, or initiate transmissions of harmful or obscene material as defined under state or federal law.

     G.     Using another patron’s library card or guest pass to access computers in the public computer room or café computers.

     H.     Damaging, vandalizing, or attempting to damage or alter the library and observatory’s computer equipment, resources, data or software or interfering with systems operations, integrity, or security, including intentional propagation of computer viruses. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.034 Computers—Use by children.
     Children under the age of fourteen are permitted to use the computers located in the children’s room area of the library and observatory. The library and observatory has created a home page and related web pages entitled “kids’ library” to provide educational information and activities for children, as well as hyperlinks to other websites for use by children.

     Computers made available for children in the children’s room are equipped with a commercial filter. Its purpose is to block access to materials accessible through the internet that are inappropriate for viewing in the public setting or serve limited educational or informational purposes for children. However, no filter is ever completely successful in blocking inappropriate sites and commercial filters have a variable rate of effectiveness in screening out age-inappropriate sites.

     Parents, guardians, and caregivers are encouraged to work with their children to develop acceptable rules of internet use. It is their responsibility to set standards and guidelines and to decide which library and observatory resources and internet websites or resources are appropriate for their children. library and observatory staff are available to assist parents and their children with internet use and to help identify appropriate internet sites. The library and observatory staff has neither the right nor the responsibility to act in place of a parent or guardian and assumes no responsibility for use of the internet by minors.

     Children under the age of fourteen may not use the computers in the Jeanne & Charlie Parrish computer room or in the café unless they are accompanied by a responsible adult age eighteen or older. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.036 Suspension and revocation of privileges.

9.20.070 Confidentiality of library records.
     California state law protects the contents of library patron records (Government Code, Sec. 6267). Under this law, library employees are prohibited from sharing information about what a patron has checked out with anyone else, including parents and spouses. Under this law, library staff is not permitted to do any of the following:

     A.     Tell a parent what a child has checked out even if a fee is owed on that material.

     B.      Provide access to library records to law enforcement without a search warrant.

     C.      A patron can permit other people to know what they have checked out or to pick up holds for them by completing a “confidentiality waiver” specifically allowing a person to have access to their library records.

     D.     In the event of lost items, circulation information only regarding lost materials will be made available to the person who is financially responsible for payment of the lost items without a written request or consent of the patron. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.072 Collection development policy.
     The library and observatory provides a variety of print and non-print materials to meet the informational, educational, and recreational needs of the entire community.

     The library and observatory seeks to provide breadth within the collection, various points of view, and differing formats. The library and observatory endeavors to balance materials of permanent value with those of current interest. Materials are selected based on their content as a whole, not on selected excerpts.

     Race, nationality, or political, social, moral, or religious views of an author does not factor into the selection of materials. Selection is based on merit of the work, value of the work within the collection, and the needs and interests of the community. Consideration is given to specific types of material: to materials for specific age groups, for special interests of clientele, and to differing formats of materials. These selection criteria apply equally to materials purchased and those accepted as gifts.

     Responsibility for materials selection rests with the director operating with the authorization of and within the policies established by the library and observatory board of directors. Under the direction of the director, staff members participate in the selection of the print, electronic, and audiovisual materials added to the collection based on input from professional reviews, best seller lists, award winners, as well as direct input from the public.

     Suggestions from library and observatory patrons are encouraged and receive serious consideration. Patrons making requests that items be added to the collection will be referred to the information desk.

     Many items which are not in the collection are available to patrons through established interlibrary loan practices. Rancho Mirage residents may request interlibrary loan items free of charge. Non-residents may request materials for a fee of five dollars per item, which is collected at the time of request. The materials request fee is nonrefundable, even if the library and observatory is unable to receive the item.

     The library and observatory believes that the use of library and observatory materials is an individual and private matter. All patrons are free to select or reject materials for themselves.

     Parents have the primary responsibility to guide and direct the use of materials by their own minor children. The library and observatory shall not act in loco parentis.

     The library and observatory incorporates the library bill of rights as adopted by the American Library Association Council.

     The library serves a diverse public, and, on occasion, a patron may believe that a specific title or source should not be in the collection. In this instance, the patron should first discuss his or her concerns about the material with the library staff. If, following the discussion, the patron still wishes the library to reconsider the title or source, he or she should fill out a library evaluation of materials form. Forms are available at the library service desks. Because items are evaluated as a whole, a title will not be reconsidered unless the patron making the request has read/viewed/heard the entire item. A reconsideration form submitted without the name of the person making the objection will not be considered. Also, if the material has been previously reconsidered, it will not be reconsidered again unless the more recent request is based on substantially different reasons than an earlier request.

     The request will be referred to the director for review. The patron will be informed in writing of: (1) the receipt of the request; and (2) the decision. The directors decision will be considered final.

     The title under consideration will remain in the collection throughout the process to support the freedom of other patrons to read, view, or listen. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.074 Gift policy.
     The library and observatory encourages and welcomes gifts, donations and bequests to the library and observatory.

     Unless otherwise designated and agreed to by the donor and director, the library and observatory will utilize the gift, donation or bequest, as deemed appropriate by the library and observatory. This may include adding to the existing collection, creating a special collection, designating any donated books and other material for sale in the library and observatory foundation book store or foundation book sales. All books, materials and other property received by the library and observatory from anonymous sources will be treated as donations.

     In addition, unless otherwise designated by the donor, gifts, donations and bequests to the library and observatory shall be used to supplement funds appropriated for use by the library and observatory, but shall not be used to supplant funds appropriated for library and observatory salaries or maintenance and operations of the library and observatory.

     All other donations, gifts and bequests of any material or other property that cannot be incorporated into the existing collection or be used for creating a special collection, shall require the approval of director with the consent and advice of the library and observatory board of directors. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.076 Disposal of obsolete and surplus materials.
     The director may discard materials from the library and observatory collection if the director determines the materials to be obsolete or surplus because they are physically worn or damaged, surplus to the collection, contain outdated information, or deemed no longer relevant to the needs of patrons.

     Disposal of obsolete or surplus materials, may be accomplished as follows:

     A.     Donate them to the Rancho Mirage library and observatory foundation for sale in the foundation book nook.

     B.      Sell them, when possible, to used book dealers or other interested individuals or groups, with proceeds deposited in the library and observatory fund.

     C.      Donate them to other libraries, schools, non-profit, and/or charitable organizations.

     D.     Discard them as recycling. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.078 Displays and exhibits policy.
     Displays and exhibits are an integral aspect of the services offered by the library and observatory. To ensure that displays and exhibits are properly designed and safely situated and displayed or exhibited, all displays and exhibits must be approved by the director in accordance with the following guidelines:

     A.     Displays and exhibits of art, memorabilia, and/or collectibles are permitted in designated display and exhibit areas and locations in the library and observatory provided that they shall be for non-commercial purposes and of interest to a large segment of the community and be of artistic, cultural, historic, or literary merit, unless otherwise provided herein below.

     E.      Displays and exhibits shall not be used to promote or advertise for sale, including prices, of any materials which are on display in any display or exhibit in the library and observatory, with the exception of materials sold, promoted or marketed by the library and observatory, library and observatory foundation or Rancho Mirage writers festival.

     F.      Certain material may be displayed or placed in the library and observatory’s brochure rack by non-profit tax-exempt organizations for non-commercial, non-profit purposes subject to the approval of the director. (Ord. 1169 § 2, 2020)

 

9.30.080 Observatory use—Rental policy.
     The library and observatory facilities are available for use by members of the general public, clubs and organizations for particular types of short-term events. In determining the observatory’s allowable use and to whom use rights are granted, the city acts in a proprietary capacity. The observatory is not a forum for unlimited expression by the general public. No religious or political events are permitted. The purpose of the library and observatory is to provide a specific forum for educational and scientific programs and services for the benefit of the public funded, organized and/or permitted by the city in a safe, secure and clean and sanitary environment.

     The purpose of this observatory rental policy is to prescribe standards for the city’s allowance of use of the observatory.

     H.     “Space rent” means the consideration, including any bonus, benefit or gratuity demanded or received in connection with the use and occupancy of a mobilehome space in a mobilehome park. (Ord. 1155 § 2, 2019; Ord. 599 § 1, 1994; Ord. 503 § 1, 1991; Ord. 406 § 1, 1988)

 

9.58.020 Applicability—Rent increase restrictions.
     A.     The provisions of this chapter shall apply to mobilehome parks located within the city and to those rental spaces in a mobilehome park which are located entirely within the city limits.

     B.      The provisions of this chapter shall apply only to changes in rental rates or park rules and regulations effective on or after May 1, 1982.

     C.      Nothing in this chapter shall apply to any rental increase agreed to in a lease for a period greater than twelve months or to any extension or renewal of such a lease between a mobilehome park owner and a resident and/or prospective unit owner and/or prospective resident of the park if the lease is for a period in excess of twelve months’ duration and otherwise complies with Civil Code Section 798.17, and, in addition, satisfies the following requirements:

     1.      Before any rental agreement or lease, in excess of twelve months, is offered to any tenant, it must first be submitted to the mobilehome fair practices commission for review to determine if it complies with the terms of the mobilehome rent control ordinance. It shall not be offered to the tenant until the proposed lease or rental agreement has been approved by the commission.

     2.      Before any rental agreement or lease in excess of twelve months is executed by the resident the owner must:

     a.      Offer the resident the option of a rental agreement for a term of twelve months or less;

     b.      Provide the resident with a copy of the mobilehome rent control ordinance; and

     c.      Inform the resident both orally and in writing that if the resident signs a lease or rental agreement with a term in excess of twelve months which has been reviewed and approved by the commission in accordance with the provisions of the mobilehome rent control ordinance, the lease or rental agreement may not be subject to the terms and protections of the mobilehome rent control ordinance.

     D.     If a space in a mobilehome park is voluntarily vacated on or after May 1, 1982, and while this chapter is in effect, the rent may be increased upon the rerental of the space to an amount which does not exceed the average rental rate for comparable space rent in the park. As long as the space continues to be rented to one or more of the same persons, the rent in effect on the rerental shall be the base rent for the purpose of commission review of any rental rate increases after the date of the rerental. For the purposes of this subsection, the vacation of a space is voluntary if it was not the result of an eviction, whether for just cause or otherwise or the result of owner’s refusal to renew a periodic tenancy or lease agreement.

     E.      If a space was not rented on May 1, 1982, but was subsequently rerented and continued to be rented to one or more of the same persons, the rental in effect on the rerental shall be the base rent for the purpose of commission review of any rental rate increase after the date of rerental.

     F.      If a space is involuntarily vacated after May 1, 1982, the rental rate in effect on the date of such involuntary vacation shall be the base rent for the purpose of commission review of any rental rate increase.

     G.     A mobilehome park owner may not unreasonably withhold permission of a unit owner to rent or sublease the owner’s unit. The park owner may condition the re-rental or sublease upon a new rent, as set forth in subsection D of this section, and reasonable approval of the new tenant. (Ord. 508 § 1, 1991; Ord. 503 § 2, 1991; Ord. 406 § 1, 1988)

 

9.58.030 Hardship increases—Petition by mobilehome park owner.
     A.     If the application of this chapter, or any section thereof, would operate to confiscate the mobilehome park owners’ property in violation of the United States Constitution or California Constitution, then such act, section or part shall not apply to said owner regarding such property.

     B.      No mobilehome park owner shall increase any rent pursuant to this section unless and until the mobilehome park owner obtains a hardship adjustment granted by the commission as provided in this chapter in Section 9.58.070(C). A CPI rental adjustment shall not be allowed within twelve months of a park owner having received a hardship increase. A hardship increase shall not be allowed within twelve months of a CPI rental adjustment. It is intended that there will be no more than one rental increase imposed on the tenants within any twelve-month period.

     C.      The commission shall receive petitions or applications for adjustment of rent only from October 1st through to and including the following March 1st. A complete petition will, after receipt, be heard and determined as otherwise provided within this chapter. Any mobilehome park owner who shall be granted any such hardship adjustment as to one or more mobilehome spaces, may adjust the rent on such space or spaces in an amount not exceeding the amount of the hardship adjustment so granted or approved by the commission, upon giving to the residents such written notice as is required by law. Service upon any resident of a copy of the petition or application to such commission for a hardship adjustment of rent shall be deemed to constitute the notice of rent increase referred to in Section 9.58.040 of this chapter; provided, however, that the resident shall be entitled to at least ninety days’ written notice of the actual dollar amount of any rent increase. (Ord. 894 § 1, 2004; Ord. 406 § 1, 1988)

 

9.58.040 Notice of rent increase.
     A notice of rent increase allowable by this chapter may be served upon the park residents at any time. Any such increase shall become effective not less than the notice period specified in Civil Code Section 798.30, (“the statutory notice period”) as that section may be amended from time to time. All notices of rent increase shall be served in the manner prescribed by law. If any notice required by this chapter is not served on the tenant, the tenant shall not be required to pay any increase in rent until the statutory notice period after such notice is served on him/her has expired. If any notice of rent increase, served pursuant to this section, does not state the actual dollar amount of such rent increase a supplemental or additional notice which does state the actual dollar amount of such rent increase shall be served upon the tenant, in the manner prescribed by law. The increase noticed in the supplemental or additional notice shall be effective on the date the statutory notice period expires. (Ord. 706 § 1, 1998; Ord. 406 § 1, 1988)

 

*    Civil Code Section 798.30 requires ninety days’ notice for a rent increase.

 

9.58.050 Reduction in services.
     A.     No mobilehome park owner shall reduce or eliminate any service to any mobilehome space and/or any common area of the mobilehome park such as streets, sewage systems, utility systems, security systems, recreational facilities, laundry facilities, TV antenna systems, clubhouse or recreation hall, air conditioning/heating systems in common area buildings, or any other common area amenity of the park, so long as this chapter is in effect, unless and until any proportionate share of the cost savings resulting from such reduction or elimination is passed on to the resident in the form of a decrease in space rent. If the commission otherwise determines that the park owner is entitled to any increase in existing rent, they will then subtract from such a proposed rental increase the value of any such services which has been eliminated or reduced from the park from such rental increase. For example, if a mobilehome park owner who provides services to a mobilehome space in the nature of utility services shall reduce or eliminate such service by separate metering or other lawful means of transferring from the mobilehome park owner to the resident the obligation for payment for such services, the cost savings, if any, resulting from such reduction or elimination shall be passed on to the resident in the form of a decrease of rent. The computation of such cost savings shall be based upon the average monthly charge for such service for the prior year or such other period as the parties shall mutually agree or determined by the commission to be representative of such cost savings.

     B.      For the purposes of this section in determining cost savings to be passed on to the resident in the form of decreased rent, the cost of installation of separate utility meters, or similar or analogous costs to the mobilehome park owner to shift the obligation for payment of utility costs to the resident, shall not be considered. Nothing stated herein shall be construed to prohibit or prevent the consideration or inclusion of such costs, together with other operational costs of a mobilehome park owner, in any proceedings before a duly appointed board, commission or other appointed body, authorized to hear and determine requests for hardship adjustments. (Ord. 406 § 1, 1988)

9.58.070 Commission—Powers and duties.
     Within the limitation provided by law, the mobilehome fair practices commission shall have the following powers and duties:

     A.     To meet at such times as may be regularly scheduled by the commission, or from time to time at the call of the chairman to hear and determine petitions filed hereunder, and to gather evidence as required to determine issues presented in the petitions through the use of subpoenas as provided within Government Code Section 11450.10 et seq. to otherwise conduct business of the commission, and to utilize city offices and facilities as needed and as available;

     B.      To receive, hear and determine petitions or other requests of tenants or other interested persons for the interpretations of this chapter, or for review of a mobilehome park owner’s actions pursuant to this chapter. In hearing such petitions or request of resident or other interested persons, the commission shall have no authority to fix or award civil penalties, damages or attorney’s fees, but shall have the authority to assess against a mobilehome park owner appearing in such proceeding the actual cost, in whole or in part, of the conduct of such proceedings in those cases where the commission shall find and determine that the mobilehome park owner has, in fact, violated the terms of this chapter. The findings and determination or decision of the commission shall be available in written form for use in any judicial proceeding which may be brought pursuant to this chapter;

     C.      To receive, investigate, hear and determine petitions of landlords for hardship adjustment of rent pursuant to Section 9.58.030 of this chapter, and to use the services of retained professional assistance within the restraint of funds for the services as available within a trust fund established for this purpose;

     D.     To make or conduct such independent hearings or investigations as may be appropriate to obtain such information as is necessary to carry out its duties. All decisions of the commission shall be prospective but may be made retroactive in operation and application to the date of the alleged incident. The commission shall have the power and authority to order the reimbursement of rent by a mobilehome park owner to residents, and to enforce against any mobilehome park owner, retroactively, any increase of rent in violation of this chapter for any period of time before the date of the filing of the petition which is the basis for the order. If the commission shall find that a mobilehome park owner has accepted, received or retained any rent payment in excess of the amounts permitted by this chapter, or that the mobilehome park owner has otherwise violated the terms of this chapter, the commission may make corrective orders as necessary with the right of judicial review retained by the park owner. Where the party to a petition before the commission has failed to comply with a prior order of the commission, the commission may directly implement its prior order through an administrative judgment. The judgment may directly order a rent increase or decrease upon which any park owner or tenant may rely without civil liability. Nothing stated in this section shall be construed to prohibit or preclude voluntary adjustment or settlement of any claims or causes of action which may exist between the mobilehome park owner and the resident;

     E.      To authorize an increase in the maximum amount of rent otherwise permitted to be charged by a mobilehome park owner pursuant to this chapter. Such authorization shall be given only in those cases where the commission finds that the application of this chapter, apart from such authorized increase, results or would result in undue hardship to the mobilehome park owner, or would prevent a mobilehome park owner from obtaining a just and reasonable return on the mobilehome park owner’s property. Such authorization to increase the maximum rent may be granted for a stated period of time or permanently as appropriate according to the facts. Such adjustment of maximum rent may take the form of a redetermination of base rent, a surcharge of a given dollar or percentage amount, a separate charge for utility or other services, or such other form as the commission shall find most appropriate. In determining whether hardship rent increase should be authorized, the commission may consider, among other relevant facts, reduction or elimination of any service by the park owner to any mobilehome space or common area of the mobilehome park, increased costs to the mobilehome park owner attributable to increases or decreases in master land and/or facilities lease rent, utility rates, property taxes, insurance, advertising, debt service cost, governmental assessments and fees, incidental services, normal repair and maintenance, capital improvements, upgrading and addition of amenities or services, net operating income, as well as just and reasonable return on the mobilehome park owner’s property;

     F.      To render, at least semiannually, a written report to the city council concerning its activities, rulings, actions, results of hearings and all other matters pertinent to this chapter, including recommendations for amendment thereof, within the limitations of Section 9.58.080;

     G.     To adopt, promulgate, amend and rescind administrative rules of procedure. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as authority for the commission to make any administrative rules affecting the substantive rights of either mobilehome park owners or residents;

     H.     To maintain and keep at City Hall hearing files and dockets listing the time, date and place of hearings, the parties involved, the addresses of said parties and final disposition of each such petition with appropriate findings;

     I.       To recommend to the city council the adoption of a fee schedule setting such fees and charges as appear necessary or desirable to defray in whole or in part the costs of administration of the commission and conduct of its assigned duties.

     J.       To conduct hearings pursuant to Section 9.58.090, and initiated pursuant to Section 9.58.080, regarding matters within the subject matter jurisdiction of the commission as set out in this chapter. The commission shall make a final decision no later than ten days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall provide written notice of the decision to each party, as specified in Section 9.58.090.

     K.     To review all applications and requests submitted by any mobile home park owner seeking financial assistance from the housing authority or redevelopment agency for maintenance or construction of any mobile home park improvement, or for a service provided to residents of a mobile home park, and to make recommendations to the housing authority board/redevelopment agency board regarding the same.(Ord. 923 § 1, 2006; Ord. 892 §§ 1, 2, 2004; Ord. 891 § 1, 2004; Ord. 556 § 1, 1993; Ord. 476 § 1, 1990; Ord. 406 § 1, 1988)

If the commission shall establish forms for such petitions, the petition shall be prepared and submitted upon such form.

     B.      Any mobilehome park owner of a mobilehome park affected by this chapter may, upon payment of such filing fee as shall be duly established, petition the commission for an interpretation of this chapter, or for a determination whether a particular proposed course of action by said mobilehome park owner is allowable, valid and in conformity with this chapter. The commission may designate forms for the filing of such petitions. In the event that no such form has been designated, the petition shall be in writing and shall contain the name, address and telephone number, if any, of the person requesting the interpretation or opinion; the name and address of each resident of a mobilehome space owned or managed by the person requesting the interpretation or opinion, if it is intended that such interpretation or opinion affects such mobilehome space; a brief statement of the facts giving rise to the request for interpretation or opinion; and a statement that a copy of such petition has been personally served upon or mailed to each such resident who might be affected thereby.

A mobilehome park owner or any representative of the mobilehome park owner, operator or manager, or mobilehome owner, or mobilehome owner representative of a mobilehome space affected by this chapter, upon payment of such filing fee as shall be duly established, may petition the commission for a hardship increase of the maximum rent permitted to be charged pursuant to this chapter only from October 1 to March 1.

Only that documentation filed at least fifteen days before the hearing may be introduced into evidence before the commission, unless the proponent of the documentary evidence can establish to the commission’s satisfaction that the proponent was unaware of the relevance and/or necessity of the evidence prior to the fifteen day limitations period.

     D.     The city manager, or his or her designee, may waive the payment of the filing fee required in Section 9.58.080(A) if the resident meets all of the following criteria:

Notice shall also be given to any person who has filed a written request for notice with the commission and has paid the fee established by the city’s fee resolution for such notice. The commission may also require notice to any other parties it may deem interested in the petition. Notice shall be deemed given on the date the notice was personally delivered or mailed through the United States mails with postage prepaid. (Ord. 923 § 3, 2006)

     C.      In the event that any party shall fail to appear at the time and place set for hearing of a petition, the commission may hear and review such evidence as may be presented, and may make such findings and decisions as shall be supported by the evidence presented.

     D.     The commission shall make findings based on the evidence as to each fact relevant to the commission’s decision on the petition. The decision of the commission shall be based upon the findings, and shall:

No rent increase shall be authorized unless supported by the preponderance of the evidence. A notice of the commission’s decision shall be sent to each party to a proceeding. Unless good cause to the contrary shall appear, each decision of the commission shall apply on a space by space basis, taking into account the possibility of differences in base rent, services provided, and other facts differentiating rental units.

     F.      Nothing in this chapter, or in any decision of the mobilehome fair practices commission, shall require any mobilehome park owner to raise rents or charges to residents.

The order of the commission may be introduced by the respective parties to the court as conclusive of the issues addressed therein.

     Abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof located on parcels of land zoned for agricultural use or parcels of land not improved with a residential structure containing one or more dwelling units are declared to be public nuisances. (Ord. 449 § 1, 1989; Ord. 27 § 1, 1973)

 

10.64.020 Applicability of chapter.
     The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the following:

     A.     A vehicle or parts thereof which is completely enclosed within a building in a lawful manner where it is not visible from the street or other public or private property; or

     B.      A vehicle or parts thereof which is stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer, a junk dealer or when storage or parking is necessary to the operation of a lawfully conducted business or commercial enterprise; or

     C.      When the vehicle is undergoing emergency repairs, not to exceed forty-eight hours in duration, necessary to make the vehicle operational, and which repairs are restricted to vehicles owned by residents and members of the families residing on the premises. (Ord. 269 § 2, 1983; Ord. 27 § 2, 1973)

 

10.64.030 Abatement.

     A.     There shall be included in the notice to the property owner a statement that he may appear in person at the hearing or may present a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land with his reasons for such denial in lieu of appearing. The notice of intention to abate shall be mailed by registered mail to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owner of record, unless the vehicle was in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.

     B.      A public hearing shall be held upon request for such a hearing by the owner of the vehicle or the owner of the land on which such vehicle was located. This request shall be made within ten days after the mailing of notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle. If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such time period, this statement shall be construed as a request for hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. If such a request is not received within such period, removal of the vehicle shall be authorized.

     C.      If, at the hearing, the owner of the land upon which the vehicle is located denies responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, either in person or by sworn written statement, and if it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and that he has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the city council shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from the owner.

     D.     The city manager or his authorized representative shall, within five days after removing any such vehicle, notify the Department of Motor Vehicles, identifying the vehicle or part thereof, and any evidence of registration available, including, but not limited to, the registration certificates of title or license plates.

     E.      After any such vehicle has been removed, it shall not be reconstructed or made operable, unless it is a vehicle which qualifies for either horseless carriage license plates or historical vehicle license plates, in which case the vehicle may be reconstructed or made operable. (Ord. 916 §5, 2006; Ord. 100 § 75, 1976; Ord. 27 § 3, 1973)

 

10.64.040 Declared nuisance on improved residential properties.
     Abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles parked on residential properties that are improved with one or more dwelling units are declared to be public nuisances. (Ord. 449 § 2, 1989)

 

10.64.050 Enforcement.
     Abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof shall be abated pursuant to the public nuisance abatement provisions set forth in Title 14 of this code; provided, however, that in addition to said procedures, the following regulations shall apply:

     A.     Notice to Abate. Notice of public nuisance shall be mailed by registered or certified mail to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owner of record of the vehicle, unless the vehicle was/is in such a condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. The notice of public nuisance shall include a statement explaining to the owner of the land that he/she may appear in person at the hearing or may present a sworn, written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land with his/her reasons for such denial in lieu of appearing.

     B.      Appeal—Hearing. A public hearing shall be held upon request for such a hearing by the owner of the vehicle or the owner of the land on which such vehicle was located. This request shall be made within ten days after the mailing of notice of public nuisance. (Ord. 916 §6, 2006; Ord. 449 § 2, 1989)

 

10.64.060 Violation—Penalty.
     After such ten-day period, if the vehicle still exists on the property in the same manner, the vehicle and/or property owner will be issued a citation.

(Ord. 28 § 9, 1973)

 

12.12.110 Responsibilities—Property owners—Notice.
 

     A.     Every person owning, operating, leasing, occupying or renting a building or structure within a district shall construct and provide that portion of the service connection on his property between the facilities referred to in Section 12.12.100 and the termination facility on or within such building or structure being served. If the above is not accomplished by any person within the time provided for in the resolution enacted pursuant to Section 12.12.050, the city engineer shall give notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises, and notice in writing to the owner thereof as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, to provide the required underground facilities within ten days after receipt of such notice.

     B.      The notice to provide the required underground facilities may be given by either personal service or by mail. In case of service by mail on either of such persons, the notice must be deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope with postage prepaid, addressed to the person in possession of such premises at such premises, and the notice must be addressed to the owner thereof as such owner’s name appears, and must be addressed to such owner’s last known address as the same appears on the last equalized assessment roll, and when no address appears, to general delivery, city of Rancho Mirage. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed to have been received by the person to whom it has been sent within forty-eight hours after the mailing thereof. If notice is given by mail to either the owner or occupant of such premises, the city engineer shall, within forty-eight hours after the mailing thereof, cause a copy thereof, printed on a card not less than eight inches by ten inches in size, to be posted in a conspicuous place on such premises.

     C.      The notice given by the city engineer to provide the required underground facilities shall particularly specify that work is required to be done, and shall state that if such work is not completed within thirty days after receipt of such notice, the city engineer will provide such required underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof will be assessed against the property benefitted and become a lien upon such property.

     D.     If, upon the expiration of the thirty day period, the required underground facilities have not been provided, the city engineer shall forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises are unoccupied and no electric or communication services are being furnished thereto, the city engineer shall, in lieu of providing the required underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to such property. Upon completion of the work by the city engineer, he shall file a written report with the city council setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided and the costs thereof, together with a legal description of the property against which such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of the cost of such work upon such premises, which such time shall not be less than ten days thereafter.

     E.      The city engineer shall forthwith, upon the time for hearing such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing thereof to the owner thereof, in the manner hereinabove provided for the giving of the notice to provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place that the council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed assessment.

     F.      Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the council shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any, and then proceed to affirm, modify or reject the assessment.

     G.     If any assessment is not paid within five days after its confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien upon the property against which the assessment is made by the city engineer, and the city engineer is directed to turn over to the assessor and tax collector a notice of lien on each of said properties on which the assessment has not been paid, and the assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises upon which such assessment was not paid. Such assessment shall be due and payable at the same time as the property taxes are due and payable, and if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum. (Ord. 28 § 10, 1973)

 

12.12.120 Responsibilities—City.
     The city shall remove at its own expense all city-owned equipment from all poles required to be removed by this chapter in ample time to enable the owner or user of such poles to remove the same within the time specified in the resolution enacted pursuant to Section 12.12.050. (Ord. 28 § 11, 1973)

 

12.12.130 Extension of time when.

Chapter 12.16 UNDERGROUND UTILITY LINES
Note
*    Prior ordinance history: Ord. 84 and Ord. 100 § 105.

 

12.16.010 When underground installation required.
     Except as provided in this chapter, all electrical distribution lines, telephone, cable antenna television and similar service wires or cables which: (A) provide direct service to the property being developed; or (B) are existing and located within the boundaries of the property being developed; or (C) are existing between the property line and the centerline of the peripheral streets of the property being developed; or (D) are located along or within six feet of the rear or side lot lines of the property to be developed; or (E) are within the existing or required right-of-way for a project; or (F) are relocated as a result of a project; shall, at the discretion of the city, be installed underground. The city retains the discretion to impose these undergrounding requirements by either levying a fee or license tax on all new development, to cover the cost of city-wide undergrounding of utilities attributable to new development; or requiring, as a condition imposed on new development, undergrounding of adjacent utility lines subject to any applicable development fee or license tax credits and reimbursements. (Ord. 580 § 1 Exh. A, 1993; Ord. 500 § 1, 1991; Ord. 371 § 1, 1986; Ord. 132 § 1, 1977)

 

12.16.020 Exceptions—Generally.
     The following exceptions shall apply:

     A.     If the city determines that a required adjacent street widening is impeded by existing overhead utility lines the developer has the option of: (1) installing the utilities underground, subject to any applicable development fee or license tax credits and reimbursements by the city; or (2) temporarily moving utility poles and overhead lines. If utility poles are moved to accommodate a street widening, the undergrounding requirement is deferred to a later date and the cost of utility line relocation shall be borne by the development project in addition to the subsequent payment of development fees or license tax on new construction.

     B.      Utility service poles may be placed in the area within six feet of the rear lot line of the property to be developed for the sole purpose of terminating underground facilities.

     C.      Temporary utilities along the necessary service poles, wires, and cables may be permitted for the period during which authorized construction is continuing for which valid building permits have been issued or for temporary uses which comply with requirements of the zoning ordinance, building code and other applicable regulations.

     D.     Appurtenances and associated equipment including, but not limited to, surface-mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts in an underground system, may be placed aboveground. (Ord. 580 § 1 Exh. A, 1993; Ord. 132 § 2, 1977)

 

12.16.040 Responsibility for compliance.
     The developer or owner is responsible for complying with the requirements of this chapter and, when necessary, shall make all necessary arrangements with the utility company for the installation of such facilities. (Ord. 500 § 3, 1991; Ord. 132 § 4, 1977)

 

12.16.050 Nonconforming structures.
     Buildings and structures which are nonconforming in regard to aboveground on-site utility lines may continue to be used. However, when such buildings or structures are enlarged or when alteration or enlargement requires the installation of utility lines at new locations on the building or structure, or when existing electrical capacity to such buildings or structures is increased, or when the building is improved in an amount more than ten percent of its then fair market value, compliance with the requirements of this chapter is required. (Ord. 500 § 4, 1991; Ord. 371 § 3, 1986; Ord. 132 § 5, 1977)

Chapter 12.20 REIMBURSEMENT FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
12.20.010 Purpose of provisions.
     From time to time the city and private development install public improvements including curbs, gutters, paving, sidewalks, median islands and similar public right-of-way improvements appurtenant to parcels yet to be developed. These improvements cause the value of these parcels to increase. When these developed parcels develop, the city, for the most part, does not receive property tax revenues to reimburse for the public improvements that have directly benefitted these parcels. In addition, the private developer installing those improvements is not reimbursed for the benefit bestowed on adjacent property. This section is intended as a procedure for reimbursement of public improvements made out of moneys from the treasury of the city for such public improvements and to reimburse private developers for installation of public improvements of benefit to adjacent private landowners. (Ord. 580 § 1 Exh. A, 1993; Ord. 505 § 1, 1991; Ord. 466 § 1, 1990; Ord. 445 § 1, 1989)

 

12.20.020 Recovery of costs.
     A.     Whenever the city council determines that the public interest and necessity demand the construction and completion of public projects including, but not limited to, street improvements, including curbs, gutters, paving and sidewalks, and related improvements, including median island improvements and utility undergrounding, to undeveloped areas of the city, not adequately improved, and appropriates money out of the treasury of the city for such public improvements, no person shall be permitted to develop such property until such property owner has paid to the city the proportionate share of the cost of the street improvements as established by the city council with respect to the property; and no application, either by petition or otherwise, shall be approved by the city council for the building and/or development of such property until the property owners to be benefitted or a sufficient number thereof shall have paid to the city, or agreed to pay such proportionate share of the costs of the street improvements as in the opinion of the council insures the payment of the cost of the public street improvements. Such payments include a development fee or license tax fee on new construction obligation and shall be in addition to any other fee prescribed by any ordinance of the city.

     B.      Whenever a public project is financed in any part by the general fund of the city, the city engineer shall determine if there are any parcels directly benefitted by installation of the public project. Whenever the city engineer determines that a parcel is directly benefitted from a public project, the city engineer shall recommend to the city council, as part of the documents to be approved by the council for the public project, the amount of reimbursement to be apportioned to any such parcel. Reimbursement may be in the form of a lump sum payment to the city or payment of a development fee or license tax on new construction. The owner of any such parcel as designated upon the latest records of the county assessor, shall be notified of the council hearing for consideration of the public project. At said hearing, if the city council approves the public project, the city council shall also consider apportionment of the cost of said improvement among the parcels directly benefitted from the project. If a parcel is required to reimburse the city for any portion of the public project, a recorded document will be filed with the county recorder’s office stating the obligation is due and payable upon issuance of any permit for development upon the parcel.

     C.      As referred to herein, “permit” refers to any permit issued by the city and “development” means any improvement upon real property for which any permit is required.

     D.     A temporary waiver of payment of costs may be requested, in writing, to the city manager. A waiver request may only be submitted for a permit of improvements upon a parcel already occupied with a residence structure. The city manager may waive, for a designated period of time, all or a portion of the reimbursement. (Ord. 580 § 1 Exh. A, 1993; Ord. 497 § 1, 1991; Ord. 466 § 2, 1990; Ord. 445 § 1, 1989)

 

12.20.025 Reimbursement for utility undergrounding.
     When utility undergrounding is required by the city to accommodate a street widening, the developer shall receive a partial reimbursement from the City if the cost of utility undergrounding exceeds the amount estimated to be collected for utility undergrounding as part of development fees or license tax payments over the period of project buildout. The partial reimbursement shall be limited to the difference between the cost of undergrounding and the total estimated development fee or license tax collections for utility undergrounding. Reimbursement by the City shall only be paid from designated utility undergrounding accounts, subject to the availability of funds. (Ord. 580 § 1 Exh. A, 1993)

 

12.20.030 Private projects—Reimbursement by benefitted property owner.
     A.     Whenever the city council determines that the public interest and necessity demand the construction and completion of public right-of-way improvements including, but not limited to, street improvements, including curbs, gutters, paving and sidewalks, and related improvements, including median island improvements and utility undergrounding, adjacent to undeveloped areas of the city, not adequately improved, and places conditions of approval upon a private project for construction of such public improvements, no person shall receive a permit to develop the benefitted property until such property owner has paid to the city a proportionate share of the original costs of the public right-of-way improvements as previously required by the city council with respect to the property so benefitted.

     B.      In making this determination, the city engineer shall determine the percentage of benefit to the benefitted parcel. Such payment by the benefitted parcel shall then be paid by the city to the original private developer having installed such improvements. If the city records fail to include the identity of that developer, or the developer no longer exists, or for any reason the payment cannot be made after reasonable effort by the city, the city council may order the payment returned to the payor. (Ord. 505 § 2, 1991)

14.120.115 Public nuisance hearing.
     The city’s use of the procedure set forth in this section is entirely optional, and this section is to be construed independently from the remaining provisions of this chapter and title. Failure to employ the procedure set forth in this section shall not affect the validity of any proceedings nor the availability of any rights or remedies accorded to the city by any of the other provisions of this chapter, title or any other applicable laws, rules or regulations.

     A.     Notice of Hearing. If any notice and order issued pursuant to this chapter is not complied with or appealed within the time period set forth therein, the code compliance officer who issued the notice and order or authorized enforcement agent may, but is not required to, issue a subsequent notice entitled “Notice of Hearing Re: Municipal Code Violation(s) and Abatement of Public Nuisance” (hereinafter referred to as the “Notice of Hearing”).

     The notice of hearing shall direct the property owner(s) or other responsible person(s) to appear at a public hearing at a stated date, time and place to show cause why the conditions on the subject property should not be declared to be a public nuisance in violation of the municipal code and/or other applicable law, and ordered condemned and/or abated as such.

     The notice of hearing shall be posted to the subject property and mailed via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the property owner(s) of record, as such person’s name appears on the last County Equalized Assessment Roll, and to any mortgagee or beneficiary under any deed of trust, of record, in the subject property. Additionally, the notice of hearing shall be sent via regular U.S. mail to all record owners of parcels of real property of which any boundary is located within three hundred feet of any boundary of the subject property. The failure of any property owner, interested party, or other person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings.

     The hearing shall be set not less than fifteen days after the posting and mailing of the notice of hearing, nor later than thirty days from such date, unless a later date is agreed to by both the code enforcement officer or other authorized agent and the subject property owner(s) or other responsible person(s) having charge or control of the subject property.

     B.      Conduct of Public Hearing. The public hearing may be conducted by either: (1) the city council; or (2) an independent administrative hearing officer appointed by the city manager, as follows:

     1.      City Council. The city council may conduct the public hearing to determine whether the subject property constitutes a public nuisance. If, upon the conclusion of the hearing, the city council determines, on the preponderance of the evidence, that the property constitutes a public nuisance, it shall adopt a resolution declaring the property as such and setting forth findings and conclusions which shall be the record of the proceeding and filed with the city clerk.

     The resolution shall order the subject property owner(s) and/or other person(s) to whom the notice of hearing was sent, and whom the city council expressly deems responsible for the subject property, to abate the public nuisance conditions within no more than thirty calendar days, or such other time as the city council deems reasonable under the circumstances, commencing from the date of mailing, via certified mail, of the adopted resolution to said person(s). The resolution shall also provide that if the public nuisance conditions are not abated within said time period, said conditions may be abated by the city, and that in the event the city performs the abatement, the city’s abatement costs shall be recoverable by a special tax assessment against the subject property pursuant to Chapter 14.150 of this title, as may be amended from time to time, or by any other means provided by law. The resolution shall also specify the time allowed for judicial appeal of the decision rendered by the city council.

     A copy of the adopted resolution shall be posted to the subject property and sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the property owner(s) and all other persons to whom the notice of hearing was sent. The failure of any property owner or other person to receive the resolution in the mail shall not affect the validity of the proceedings.

     A resolution adopted by the city council pursuant to this section is a final administrative determination on the matter.

     2.      Administrative Hearing Officer Appointed by the City Manager. The city council hereby delegates concurrent authority to the city manager to appoint hearing officers to conduct administrative hearings pursuant to this section. The city manager shall ensure that no hearing officer is an employee of the city nor has any pecuniary interest in the outcome of the proceeding over which he or she is presiding.

     The administrative hearing officer, once appointed, shall conduct the hearing to determine whether the subject property constitutes a public nuisance. If, upon the conclusion of the administrative hearing, the administrative hearing officer determines, on the preponderance of the evidence, that the subject property is a public nuisance, the administrative hearing officer shall issue a written decision ordering the property owner(s) and/or other person(s) to whom the notice of hearing was sent, and whom the hearing officer expressly deems responsible for the subject property, to abate the nuisance conditions within no more than thirty calendar days, or such other time as the hearing officer deems reasonable under the circumstances, from the date of mailing, via certified mail, of the written decision to said person(s). The decision shall also provide that, if the nuisance conditions are not abated within said time period, said conditions may be abated by the city, and that in the event the city performs the abatement, the city’s abatement costs shall be recoverable by a special tax assessment against the property pursuant to Chapter 14.150 of this title, as may be amended from time to time, or by any other means provided by law. Said decision shall also specify the time allowed for judicial appeal of the decision.

     A copy of the decision shall also be posted to the subject property and sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the subject property owner(s) and other persons to whom the notice of hearing was sent. The failure of any property owner or other person to receive the written decision in the mail shall not affect the validity of the proceedings.

     A written decision issued by the administrative hearing officer shall constitute a final administrative determination on the matter.

     C.      Conduct of the Hearing.

     1.      At the time fixed for the administrative hearing, the city council or administrative hearing officer shall consider all violations of city ordinances, abatement orders, and administrative citations, including all relevant documents, statements, and objections, written or oral, which may be submitted by the city. The council or administrative hearing officer shall also consider recovery of abatement costs.

     The term “abatement costs” as used in this section means and includes all administrative and legal fees and expenses, including city staff time reasonably related to the abatement of public nuisance conditions and expenses related to enforcement, investigation, summaries, reports, notices, telephonic contact, correspondence, mailings, title searches, hearing officer costs, court costs, civil penalties, collection costs, attorneys’ fees, and all other costs associated with the removal, abatement or correction of a public nuisance. Administrative fines and penalties do not constitute “abatement costs” for purposes of this section.

     2.      The property owner(s) and any other person(s) responsible for the subject property shall be entitled to appear at the hearing and to show cause, if any they have, why the conditions on the property should not be declared to be a public nuisance in violation of the municipal code and/or other applicable law, and ordered condemned and/or abated as such. The person(s) to whom the notice of hearing is directed shall also be entitled to show cause, if any, why he/she/they is/are not responsible for the subject property. A property owner or other responsible party may be represented by another person who need not be an attorney, but any such representation shall be indicated on the record. Any non-attorney representing a property owner or other responsible party not present at the administrative hearing shall submit a verified statement sufficient to evidence the consent of the absent person to be represented by another person.

     3.      The code compliance officer or authorized enforcement agent who issued the notice of hearing shall not be required to personally attend but may participate in the hearing. Documents from the file of any applicable city division involved in the case shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

     4.      The city council or administrative hearing officer shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence and may consider hearsay evidence. The city council or administrative hearing officer shall have the authority to determine the relevance of any evidence and to exclude unduly repetitious and cumulative evidence or testimony.

     5.      If the subject property owner(s) or other responsible person(s) fail(s) to appear at the administrative hearing, the hearing shall proceed in such persons’ absence. The city council or administrative hearing officer shall make a determination based on the information submitted, and such persons shall be deemed to have waived their rights to present evidence, testify, or otherwise participate in the hearing.

     D.     Continuance of the Administrative Hearing. The city council or administrative hearing officer may grant a reasonable extension of time to conduct the hearing based on good cause shown.

     E.      Recordation. The resolution or the administrative hearing officer’s decision may be recorded in the office of the county recorder.

     F.      Appeal—Time to Bring Action. Unless the property owner or other responsible party presents an action in a court of competent jurisdiction within ninety days, or other applicable time period, after issuance of the final decision, contesting the validity of any administrative abatement proceedings leading up to and including the decision of the city council or administrative hearing officer, all objections to the proceedings and decision shall be deemed to have been waived.

Chapter 15.28 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
Note
*    Prior ordinance history: Ords. 172 and 176.

 

Article I. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods
15.28.010 Statutory authorization.
     The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.020 Findings of fact.
     A.     The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

     B.      These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.030 Statement of purpose.
     It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

     A.     Protect human life and health;

     B.      Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

     C.      Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

     D.     Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

     E.      Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

     F.      Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

     G.     Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

     H.     Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
     In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:

     A.     Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

     B.      Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

     C.      Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

     D.     Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

     E.      Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.050 Definitions.
     Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

     Accessory use means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

     Alluvial fan means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

     Apex means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front.

     Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrators interpretation of any provision of this chapter.

     Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident.

     Base flood means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the one hundred-year flood). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter.

     Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (i.e., below ground level) on all sides.

     Breakaway walls means any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

     (a)    Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood, and

     (b)    The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

     Building. See structure.

     Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

     Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

     Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

     Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

     Flood, flooding, or floodwater means:

     (a)    A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

     (b)    The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

     Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

     Flood hazard boundary map means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.

     Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

     Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

     Flood-related erosion means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

     Flood-related erosion area or flood-related erosion prone area means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

     Flood-related erosion area management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.

     Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see flood, flooding, or floodwater).

     Floodplain administrator means the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

     Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

     Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

     Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing.)

     Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as regulatory floodway.

     Floodway fringe means that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.

     Fraud and victimization, as related to Article V, Variance Procedure, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

     Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

     Governing body means the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

     Hardship, as related to Article V, Variance Procedure, of this chapter, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of ones neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

     Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

     Historic structure means any structure that is:

     (a)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

     (b)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

     (c)    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

     (d)    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

     Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

     Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

     Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see basement definition).

     (a)    An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a buildings lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

     (1)    The wet floodproofing standard in Section 15.28.170(C)(3);

     (2)    The anchoring standards in Section 15.28.170(A);

     (3)    The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.28.170(B);

     (4)    The standards for utilities in Section 15.28.180.

     (b)    For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see basement definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

     Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a recreational vehicle.

     Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

     Market value shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

     Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

     Mudslide means a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.

     Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow.

     New construction, for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

     New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community.

     Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

     (a)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

     (b)    Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.

     Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

     Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Article II. General Provisions
15.28.060 Lands to which this chapter applies.
     This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.070 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
     The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the most current flood insurance study (FIS), and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs), dated June 18, 1996, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the public works department, city of Rancho Mirage, 69-825 Hwy. 111, Rancho Mirage, CA 92270. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.080 Compliance.
     No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.090 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
     This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.

(Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.100 Interpretation.
     In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

     A.     Considered as minimum requirements;

     B.      Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

     C.      Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.110 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
     The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration or Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.120 Severability.
     This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

For purposes of this section, adversely affects means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

     B.      Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data.

     1.      When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.28.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article IV. Any such information shall be submitted to the city for adoption; or

     2.      If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas — A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations dated July 1995 in order to administer Article IV:

     a.      Simplified method.

     i.       One hundred-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and

     ii.      Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA; or

     b.      Detailed method.

     i.       One hundred-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-HMS computer program; and

     C.      Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse:

     1.      Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

     2.      Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration or Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

     3.      Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse is maintained.

     D.     Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

     1.      Certification required by Sections 15.28.170(C)(l) and 15.28.200 (lowest floor elevations),

     2.      Certification required by Section 15.28.170(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures),

     3.      Certification required by Section 15.28.170(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard),

     5.      Certification required by Section 15.28.220(A) (floodway encroachments),

     6.      (intentionally left blank), and

     7.      Reports required by Section 15.28.230(C) (mudflow standards).

     E.      Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Article V.

     F.      Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.28.080 herein. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.160 Appeals.
     The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. (Ord. 770, 2001)

15.28.220 Floodways.
     Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.28.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

     A.     Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in (the base) flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

     B.      If Section 15.28.220(A) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article IV. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.230 Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas.
     A.     The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area.

     1.      Type and quality of soils,

     2.      Evidence of ground water or surface water problems,

     3.      Depth and quality of any fill,

     4.      Overall slope of the site, and

     5.      Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope.

     C.      Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administrator shall require that:

     1.      A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering;

     2.      The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages;

     3.      The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site of off-site disturbances; and

     4.      Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. (Ord. 770, 2001)

 

15.28.240 Flood-related erosion-prone area.
     A.     The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community.

     B.      Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard.

     D.     Within zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated useful life of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. (Ord. 770, 2001)

 

Article V. Variance Procedure
15.28.250 Variances.
     The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

     It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 770, 2001)

 

15.28.260 Appeal board.
     A.     In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

     1.      Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

     2.      Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

     3.      Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

     4.      Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

     5.      Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

     6.      Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

     7.      Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

     8.      Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

     9.      Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

     10.    Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

     11.    Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

     B.      Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

     1.      The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and

     2.      Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Riverside County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

     C.      The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration or Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

 

15.28.270 Conditions for variances.
     A.     Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles III and IV of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

     B.      Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (as defined in Section 15.28.050) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

     C.      Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

     D.     Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. Minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

     E.      Variances shall only be issued upon a:

     1.      Showing of good and sufficient cause;

     2.      Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship (as defined in Section 15.28.050) to the applicant; and

     3.      Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.28.050 — see public safety and nuisance), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.28.050) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

     F.      Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of Sections 15.28.270(A) through 15.28.270(E) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and do not result in additional threats to public safety and do not create a public nuisance.

     G.     Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.28.260(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 770, 2001; Ord. 388, 1987)

     B.      The director may only approve a proposed gated community security maintenance plan, if the director determines that the measures to be taken under the plan will restrict vehicular access to the existing gated community in a manner that meets or exceeds the level of security being provided at the time the plan is submitted for approval. The director shall render his decision on a proposed gated community security maintenance plan no sooner than ten calendar days after it is submitted.

     C.      All decisions made by the director in exercising the authority given in this chapter shall be final. (Ord. 815 Exh. A (part))

 

15.30.060 Fees.
     The fee for the review and approval of a gated community security maintenance plan shall be established by resolution of the city council and shall be calculated so as to recover no more than the cost of administering the program established in that chapter. (Ord. 815 Exh. A (part))

 

15.30.070 Enforcement.
     A.     The failure to comply with the requirement of this chapter and the provisions of an approved gated community security maintenance plan is a misdemeanor and may be enforced pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.08.010 of this code.

     B.      In addition, such violations may be enforced by a civil action brought by the city attorney seeking injunctive relief.

Chapter 15.60 ABANDONED AUTOMOBILE SERVICE STATIONS
15.60.010 Findings and determinations.
     The city council finds and determines that:

     A.     The existence of closed, vacant and inoperative automobile service stations, constituting a nonuse, as defined in this chapter, has a direct, substantial and significant impact upon the aesthetic appearance of our city. Therefore, there is a need for further control over the lack of utilization, condition and appearance of such facilities.

     B.      The county fire protection district, in pursuit of protection of the health and safety of the community, requires that after underground storage tanks used for flammable or combustible liquids are taken out of service for a period of ninety days, such tanks must be properly disposed of by removal or by being permanently filled. When the required action is completed the service station is rendered unusable.

     C.      Closed, vacant and inoperative automobile service stations constituting a nonuse cannot reasonably be utilized for the purposes originally established because the cost of restoring filled fuel tanks or replacing fuel tanks is excessive.

     D.     The existence of closed, vacant and inoperative automobile service station sites constituting nonuse is injurious or dangerous to the public health, safety, comfort and welfare of the community in that such conditions invite unsightliness, blight, fire hazards, infestation, decreasing values to surrounding properties and vandalism and the existence of conditions which invite such ills constitute such abuses of property as to entitle the city to exercise its police powers in order to protect the health, safety, comfort, welfare and aesthetic value of the community and its residents.

     E.      The exercise of the city police powers for the abatement of such conditions is encompassed within the authorizations granted by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 731 and California Government Code Sections 65800, et seq., Section 38660 and Sections 38771, 38773 and 38773.5, and the California Constitution Article 11, Sections 6 and 7. The existence of the conditions heretofore described are also encompassed within the meaning of a nuisance as set forth in the California Civil Code Sections 3479 and 3480. (Ord. 364 § 1, 1986)

 

15.60.020 Declared public nuisance.
     Any closed, vacant and inoperative automobile service station constituting a nonuse as defined in this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance. (Ord. 364 § 2, 1986)

 

15.60.030 Authorization for abatement.
     Upon discovery of a nonuse automobile service station the city shall immediately commence the proceedings authorized by this chapter to cause the abatement, removal and/or enjoinment of such public nuisance in the manner prescribed by this chapter or otherwise prescribed by law. (Ord. 364 § 3, 1986)

 

15.60.040 Notification to future applicants.
     All permits for the use, occupancy, construction or repair of any automobile service station and any permits relating to any activities to be pursued therewith and all zone variances granted for real property upon which an automobile service station is located shall contain, in bold-face type, the following statement:

 

    THIS PERMIT IS GRANTED SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ORDINANCE NO. OF THE CITY OF RANCHO MIRAGE, CALIFORNIA. A VIOLATION OF THESE PROVISIONS MAY RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT BY PROCEEDINGS FOR BRINGING ABOUT REMOVAL OF ALL BUILDINGS INCLUDING ALL UNDERGROUND EQUIPMENT AND FOUNDATIONS. SUCH A VIOLATION MAY ALSO RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT BY PROSECUTION FOR MISDEMEANOR. NOTHING CONTAINED IN ORDINANCE NO. SHALL PREVENT APPLICATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE.

 

     The director of community development shall cause the above-quoted language to be incorporated into permits in connection with automobile service station uses. (Ord. 364 § 4, 1986)

 

15.60.050 Definitions.
     For the purposes of this chapter:

     A.     Automobile service station means any site where the buildings are designed and built for dispensing and selling fuels for internal combustion engines of any automotive vehicles.

     B.      Building means any physical improvement or structure finished or unfinished on or in real property which is designed, built or adapted for use as or in connection with an automotive vehicle service station, regardless of its size, shape, height, location, age or state of repair. Included in this definition are all main buildings, pumps, pump islands, all underground storage tanks, pumps, mechanical equipment, wells, cesspools, septic tanks, foundations, all paving and any other materials originally placed in connection therewith on or at any depth beneath the surface of the real property.

     C.      Nonuse means:

     1.      Conditions. When all of the subsurface tanks which are used for storage of flammable substances at an automobile service station site have been permanently filled or removed, the city council may, upon making a finding that the site can no longer be reasonably used for an automobile service station, declare the site and all buildings thereon and therein to be closed, vacant and inoperative and the conditions thereon constitute a nonuse.

     2.      Discontinuance of Nonconforming Use. Pursuant to Section 17.36.040 of this code, after a voluntary discontinuance of an automobile service station as a nonconforming use the city council may find that such discontinuance constitutes a nonuse and public nuisance.

     D.     Abatement shall be accomplished in either of the following ways:

     1.      Reoccupation by the owner, or any tenant, lessee or other party entitled to possession and reinstitution of the previously permitted automobile service station uses, after having obtained an inspection and all permits required by this code, including, but not limited to, building permits.

     2.      Demolition and removal of all buildings on and in the premises and filling of all excavations, after having obtained the applicable permits required for such work, including, but not limited to, building and grading permits. (Ord. 364 § 5, 1986)

 

15.60.060 Inspection required prior to reopening.
     A.     Prior to any reoccupation or reuse of any buildings on or in the premises, the party intending to occupy the buildings must first apply to the community development department for inspection. The inspection shall be conducted for the purpose of determining the suitability of the buildings for occupancy from the standpoint of health and safety. The inspection shall be conducted according to the standards expressed in the Uniform Building Code. Applicants must remit applicable fees for such inspection.

     B.      Any reoccupation or reuse of any buildings on or in the premises must also comply with all applicable zoning regulations of the city.

     C.      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code to the contrary, any determination made by any city employee under this section may be appealed to the city council. (Ord. 364 § 6, 1986)

 

15.60.070 Applicability.
     The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all persons or entities who claim or hold an interest in the building or in the real property, except as may be prohibited by law. (Ord. 364 § 7, 1986)

 

15.60.080 Procedures for enforcement.
     Upon discovery of conditions constituting a public nuisance as defined in Section 15.60.020 the director of community development shall initiate the proceedings authorized by this chapter to cause the abatement, removal and/or enjoinment of such public nuisance.

Chapter 15.72 MITIGATION MEASURES MONITORING AND REPORTING
15.72.010 General.
     Section 21081.6 of the Public Resources Code as modified by Assembly Bill AB 3180 (Cortese Bill), Chapter 1232, requires all public agencies to establish monitoring or reporting procedures for mitigation measures included in environmental impact reports or negative declarations which are necessary to mitigate potential environmental impacts below a level of significance. The mitigation monitoring law is the requirement to monitor the implementation of adopted mitigation measures for approved projects, and report the results of that monitoring. While AB 3180 describes this requirement as monitoring or reporting, this chapter assumes that it would be of limited usefulness to monitor projects without reporting or to report without verification. This chapter establishes the procedures necessary to carry out this state mandate. (Ord. 479 § 1, 1990)

 

15.72.020 Purpose.
     The purpose of this chapter is to establish a mitigation monitoring and reporting program for the city and to achieve the following provisions set out in Sections 15.72.030 through 15.72.090 of this chapter. (Ord. 479 § 2, 1990)

 

15.72.030 Definitions.
     A.     Monitoring refers to the process of overseeing how a mitigation measure is adequately implemented through means of periodic on-site inspections, verifying proper implementation by city departments, responsible agencies and project consultants. This oversight function ensures that all mitigation measures for a project are incorporated into the construction and/or grading plan and are being properly implemented as adopted by the city council. Monitoring is also an aid in tracking construction phases and post-occupancy activities.

     B.      Reporting refers to the documentation of the status of mitigation measures to date and of field results derived from on-site monitoring by city departments, responsible agencies and project consultants. The mitigation measure checklist contained in Section 15.72.060 of this chapter as a main component of the program shall provide feedback information regarding the status of mitigation measures implementation and their effectiveness for the public and the decision makers’ benefit. Reporting also refers to a requirement (condition(s) of approval) of the project applicant or consultant to document monitoring efforts regarding implementation of adopted mitigation measures and provide the appropriate city departments, or other agencies, with compliance reports containing such information. Reports which identify the progress, completion or violations of the implementation of mitigation measures, shall be verified by a city representative and filed in accordance with the established project program. (Ord. 479 § 3, 1990)

 

15.72.040 Application and exemptions.
     Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a program shall be established for every discretionary project approved by the city council which is subject to the adoption of either a negative declaration or an environmental impact report which includes mitigation measures necessary to reduce potentially significant environmental impacts below a level of significance. For all projects subject to this chapter, the program requirement specifics must be developed and approved after project approval by the city council and prior to issuance of a grading and/or building permit. The requirement does not apply to exempt projects or to negative declarations based upon an initial study finding of no significant impacts. (Ord. 479 § 4, 1990)

 

15.72.050 Responsibilities.
     A.     The city council is the final approval authority of all projects subject to a program. The program requirements will be adopted by the city council as a condition of the project approval and carried out administratively by city staff. The city council will also serve as the ultimate authority for project appeals, major modifications and enforcement actions for noncompliance with the established program requirements and with adopted mitigation measures and/or conditions of approval for a particular project.

     B.      The planning commission shall hear projects undertaking a major modification review and responsibility will be only an advisory capacity for those projects for which the city council has final decision making authority.

     C.      The director of community development or designee shall be responsible for assuring compliance with the provisions contained in a project program. The director may delegate duties and responsibilities to other city representatives, applicants, consultants, trustee agencies or any other responsible agency, as necessary to make certain project completion and use is consistent with the purpose and intent of the program, city procedures, ordinances and state laws. The director shall assure that required monitoring reports are filed and identified program violations are corrected. When project modifications or changes are proposed during construction the director shall determine that the changes require a project minor or major modification review and whether subsequent environmental mitigation measures are necessary.

     D.     Other City Staff. City staff shall, through administrative procedures, assist the director in assuring compliance of adopted mitigation measures. Mitigation measures shall be monitored through the city’s plan check process utilizing the mitigation measures checklist outlined in Section 15.72.060 of this chapter by each department’s plan checker. The plans will be checked for compliance with each applicable mitigation measure and verification of the status of completion will be documented on the checklist.

     The code enforcement division of the community development department shall be responsible for enforcement efforts where violations occur, or where noncompliance of this chapter occurs.

     The public works department will be involved in the city’s plan check and construction monitoring process, and shall be responsible for establishing a program for public projects carried out by its department which are subject to the program requirements, as defined in Section 15.72.030 of this chapter and in accordance with CEQA.

     E.      Responsible Agencies. Other responsible agencies may be required to monitor and report on implementation of mitigation measures and compliance reports for mitigation measures requested by these other agencies.

     F.      Outside Consultants. For projects in which compliance with a mitigation measure cannot be monitored or verified through the city’s plan check process, or requires specialized expertise, an outside consultant may be hired. The city must approve the selection of the consultant and may collect a fee from the project applicant for the consultant services or may require that all consultant fees be paid by the project applicant. The city holds the discretion as to the specifics of the consultant’s services which will be required for a project, or if a change of a consultant on the project is necessary.

     G.     Project Applicant. The project applicant is responsible for ensuring that the project complies with all adopted mitigation measures. If project modifications occur during grading or construction it is the responsibility of the applicant to notify the director regarding those changes for a determination of whether minor or major modification procedures would be required. The applicant is also responsible for applicable city and consultant fees, as outlined in Section 15.72.070 of this chapter, for necessary services in order to fulfill a mitigation measure. (Ord. 479 § 5, 1990)

 

15.72.060 Program criteria.
     A.     A mitigation measures checklist shall be required including, but not limited to the following:

     1.      The project applicant name and phone number;

     2.      The project name;

     3.      Related case files;

     4.      A project description and location;

     5.      The environmental determination and the approval date by the city council;

     6.      A list of all monitoring agencies involved;

     7.      A list of all the adopted mitigation measures;

     8.      Indication of when a mitigation measure is to be monitored (i.e., pre-construction, construction, post-occupancy);

     9.      The department or responsible agency assigned to monitor a mitigation measure;

     10.    The status of a mitigation measure upon inspection, date inspected and comments;

     11.    If a mitigation measure requires the filing of compliance reports, submittal due dates shall be indicated.

     B.      An agreement of understanding shall be required including, but not limited to the following:

     1.      A statement that the project applicant and property owner fully understand and agree to all program criteria;

     2.      A statement that the project applicant fully understands and accepts responsibility for all adopted mitigation measures contents and requirements for the approved project;

     3.      A statement that the project applicant fully understands the city’s method of enforcement and regulatory procedures for project modifications and appeals, and of this chapter. (Ord. 479 § 6, 1990)

 

15.72.070 Fees.
     Pursuant to Government Code Section 54990, the city may impose fees to fund any monitoring and/or reporting efforts, but shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the services for which the fee is charged. The project applicant shall be responsible for the cost of the preparation, administration and implementation of a program. Fees for the cost shall be paid to the city prior to issuance of a grading or building permit. Due to the different timing of mitigation measures implementation for a project program, fees will be imposed in accordance with either of the following:

     A.     For project approvals which include mitigation measures to be incorporated into the final plans and which necessitate design monitoring during plan checking and grading/construction work. Prior to issuance of grading or building permits the applicant shall submit a fee of one thousand five hundred dollars.

     B.      For project approvals which apply to subsection A of this section and also require periodic post-occupancy operational monitoring and/or reporting over a period of time or during the life of the project. Prior to issuance of grading or building permits the applicant shall submit a fee of four thousand dollars. (Ord. 479 § 7, 1990)

 

15.72.080 Program enforcement.
     A.     When a mitigation measure is required for inclusion in architectural or engineering plans, a grading or building permit shall not be issued until incorporation/compliance is verified by the director.

     B.      When a mitigation measure is to be implemented during a pre-construction, construction or post-occupancy period, noncompliance or any other violation of the project program shall result in: (1) a letter of noncompliance notifying the applicant and requesting voluntary compliance; or (2) a stop work order be issued withholding all building and/or occupancy permits by the director, building official or city engineer; or (3) a misdemeanor citation be issued.

     C.      When a mitigation measure is to be implemented prior to occupancy, implementation shall be confirmed by the director prior to issuance of occupancy permit(s) by the building division of the community development department or occupancy will be withheld.

     D.     When a mitigation measure requires long-term or frequent (monthly, yearly, etc.) monitoring and/or reporting, subsequent to an occupancy permit issuance, the director shall periodically inspect the premises for continuous mitigation compliance, and shall assure that all required compliance reports are completed and submitted to the city in a timely manner, or as the mitigation measure prescribes. Noncompliance may result in penalties. (Ord. 479 § 8, 1990)

 

15.72.090 Violation—Penalty.
     A.     Failure to comply with this chapter is declared to be unlawful and a violation of city regulations and shall be subject to the penalties and remedies set forth in Title 14 of this municipal code and/or other penalties and remedies listed in this chapter.

     B.      In the case that enforcement procedures, as outlined in Section 15.72.080 of this chapter, fail in correcting violations of a project approval program or this chapter, and if noncompliance continues or becomes frequent, one or more of the following actions shall occur:

     1.      A misdemeanor citation may be issued to the applicant or property owner by the code enforcement division of the community development department and may be carried through by criminal prosecution by the city attorney.

     A.     To eliminate the conditions of blight existing in the project area;

     B.      To prevent recurrence of blighting conditions within the project area;

     C.      To provide for participation by owners and tenants and preferences to persons engaged in business within the project area to participate in the redevelopment of the project area; to encourage and ensure the redevelopment of the project area in the manner set forth in the proposed redevelopment plan; and to provide for the relocation of residents, if any, displaced by the implementation of the proposed redevelopment plan;

     F.      To provide housing as required to satisfy the needs and desires of the various age, income and ethnic groups of the community. (Ord. 440 § 1, 1989)

 

15.80.004 Copies on file.
     The redevelopment plan for the Whitewater Redevelopment Project is approved, adopted and designated as the official redevelopment plan for the Whitewater Redevelopment Project, Amendment No. 2 and is incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof as if fully set forth at length herein, three copies of which are hereby directed to be on file with the city clerk. (Ord. 440 § 2, 1989)

 

15.80.006 Findings.
     The city council finds and determines that:

     A.     The project area has previously been declared a blighted area, and despite efforts of this council conditions of blight remain in the project area, the redevelopment of which is necessary to effectuate the public purposes declared in the Community Redevelopment Law of the state and specifically that the project area is characterized by properties which suffer from economic dislocation, deterioration or disuse because of one or more of the following factors:

     1.      The subdividing and sale of lots of irregular form and shape and inadequate size for proper development;

     2.      The existence of inadequate public improvements, public facilities, open spaces and utilities which cannot be remedied by private or governmental action without redevelopment;

     3.      A prevalence of depreciated values, impaired investments and social and economic maladjustment.

     B.      The project area is characterized by the existence of buildings and structures, used or intended to be used for living, commercial, industrial or other uses, which are unfit or unsafe to occupy for such purposes and are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime because of one or more of the following factors:

     1.      Defective design and character of physical construction;

     2.      Faulty interior arrangement and exterior spacing; and

     3.      Age obsolescence, deterioration, dilapidation, mixed character or shifting of uses.

     C.      The redevelopment plan will redevelop the project area in conformity with the community redevelopment law of the state in the interests of the public peace, health, safety and welfare.

     D.     The adoption and carrying out of the redevelopment plan is economically sound and feasible.

     E.      The redevelopment plan conforms to the general plan.

     F.      The carrying out of the redevelopment plan will promote the public peace, health, safety and welfare of the city and will effectuate the purposes and policies of the Community Redevelopment Law of the state.

 

     G.     The condemnation of real property, provisions for which are being added to the redevelopment plan, is necessary to the execution of the redevelopment plan and adequate provisions have been made for payment for property to be acquired as provided by law.

     H.     The agency has a feasible method or plan for the relocation of families and persons to be temporarily or permanently displaced from housing facilities in the project area.

     I.       There are or are being provided in the project area, or in other areas not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial facilities and at rents or prices within the financial means of the families and person displaced from the project area, if any decent, safe and sanitary dwellings equal in number to the number of and available to such displaced families and persons and reasonably accessible to their places of employment.

     J.       Inclusion within the project area of any lands, buildings or improvements which are not detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare is necessary for the effective redevelopment of the area of which they are a part; and any such area included is necessary for effective redevelopment and is not included for the purpose of obtaining the allocation of tax increment revenues from such area pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section 33670 of the Community Redevelopment Law without other substantial justification for its inclusion.

     K.     The elimination of blight and redevelopment of the project area cannot be reasonably expected to be accomplished by private enterprise acting alone without the aid and assistance of the agency.

     L.      The housing program amendment is consistent with the project, as reviewed within the draft environmental impact report, and the agency has found that the final environmental impact report will contain mitigation measures to mitigate project impacts. (Ord. 440 § 3, 1989)

 

15.80.008 Implementation of the project.
     In order to implement and facilitate the effectuation of the redevelopment plan approved and adopted, it is found and determined that certain official actions must be taken by the city council with reference, among other things, the vacating and removal of the streets, alleys and other public ways, the establishment of new street patterns, the location and relocation of sewer and water mains and other public facilities, and other public action and, accordingly, the city council:

     A.     Declares its intention to undertake and complete any proceedings necessary to be carried out by the city under the provisions of the redevelopment plan; and

     B.      Requests the various officials, departments, boards, commissions and agencies of the city having administrative responsibilities with respect to the project likewise to cooperate to such end and to exercise their respective functions and powers in a manner consistent with the redevelopment plan. (Ord. 440 § 4, 1989)

 

15.80.010 Housing of displaced persons.
     The city council is satisfied permanent housing facilities will be available within three years from the time occupants of the project area are displaced, if any, and that pending the development of such facilities, there will be available to such displaced occupants adequate temporary housing facilities at rents comparable to those in the city at the time of their displacement. No persons or families of low and moderate income shall be displaced from residences unless and until there is a suitable housing unit available and ready for occupancy by such displaced person or family at rents comparable to those at the time of their displacement. Such housing units shall be suitable to the needs of such displaced persons or families and must be decent, safe, sanitary and otherwise standard dwellings. The agency shall not displace such person or family until such housing units are available and ready for occupancy. (Ord. 440 § 5, 1989)

 

15.80.012 Financing generally.
     The city council is convinced that the effect of tax-increment financing, as provided for in Section 502 of the redevelopment plan and as described in the report to the city council submitted to the city council in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 33352, will not cause a severe financial burden or detriment to any taxing agency deriving revenues from the project area. (Ord. 440 § 6, 1989)

 

15.80.014 Administration.
     The city clerk is directed to send a certified copy of this chapter to the agency, and the agency is vested with the responsibility for carrying out the redevelopment plan, subject to the provisions of the redevelopment plan. (Ord. 440 § 7, 1989)

 

15.80.016 Recordation—Distribution.

(Ord. 440 §§ 8, 10, 1989)

 

15.80.018 Informing of developers.
     The building department of the city is directed for a period of two years after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter to advise all applicants for building permits within the project area that the site for which a building permit is sought for the construction of buildings or for other improvements is within a redevelopment project area.

16.14.060 Rights of a vesting tentative map.
     A.     Approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Map Act Section 66474.2. However, development fees and other fees are not affected by any vested rights conferred through a vesting tentative map.

     B.      However, if Map Act Section 66474.2 is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved.

     C.      Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following findings are determined:

     1.      A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivisions or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both.

     2.      The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state or federal law.

     D.     The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.14.050. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time:

     1.      An initial time period of one year beyond the recording of the final map or parcel map. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. All final maps or parcel maps must be recorded within the time period contained in Section 16.14.050 or the vesting tentative map approval shall expire for those parcels for which final maps or parcel maps are not timely recorded.

     2.      The initial time period contained in subdivision 1 of this subsection shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if the processing exceeds thirty days, from the date a complete application is filed.

     3.      A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period outlined in subdivision 1 of this subsection expires.

     4.      If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time outlined in subdivisions 1 through 3 of this subsection the rights referred to herein shall continue until either expiration or extension of that permit.

     5.      Consistent with subsection A of this section, an approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall not limit the city from imposing reasonable conditions on subsequent required approvals or permits necessary for the development. (Ord. 469 § 1, 1990)

The subdivider shall submit to the engineer the original tracing of the map and any duplicates pursuant to city requirements, corrected to its final form and signed by all parties required to execute the certificates on the map. Original signatures shall appear on the original drawing. Upon receipt of all required certificates and submittals, the engineer shall sign the appropriate certificates and transmit the original map to the city clerk. (Ord. 469 § 1, 1990)

 

16.16.080 Approval by city council.
     A.     The final map approved by the engineer as complying with the approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall be filed with the council for approval after all required certificates have been signed. The date the map shall be deemed filed with the council is the date on which the city clerk receives the map. The council shall consider the final map for approval at its next available regular meeting after the city clerk receives the map. Before approving the final map, the council shall consider approval of the subdivision improvement agreement pursuant to Section 16.20.080.

     B.      If the subdivision improvement agreement and final map are approved by the council, the city manager shall execute the agreement on behalf of the city. At the time the council approves the final map, it shall also accept, accept subject to improvement, or reject any offer of dedication. The city clerk shall certify on the final map the action by the council. If at the time the final map is approved, any streets, paths, alleys, public utility easements, rights-of-way for local transit facilities, or storm drainage easements are not accepted by the council, the offer of the dedication shall remain open and the council may, by resolution at any later date, and without further action by the subdivider, rescind its action and accept and open the streets, paths, alleys, rights-of-way for local transit facilities, or storm drainage easements, which acceptance shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder.

     C.      The city may accept any dedications lying outside the subdivision boundary which require a separate grant deed. The acceptance shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder.

     D.     If the subdivision improvement agreement and/or final map is unacceptable, the council shall state its recommended corrections, instruct the engineer to draft a new agreement and/or revise the final map and defer approval until an acceptable agreement and/or final map has been resubmitted.

     E.      The council shall not postpone or refuse approval of a final map because the subdivider has failed to meet a tentative map condition requiring construction or installation of off-site improvements on land which neither the subdivider nor the city has sufficient title or interest to permit the improvements to be made. Consequently, the city shall follow the procedure outlined in Section 16.20.120. Additionally, the council shall not deny approval of the final map if the city has previously approved a tentative map for the proposed subdivision and if the council finds that the final map is in compliance with the requirements of the Map Act, this title, and the tentative map and all conditions thereof. (Ord. 469 § 1, 1990)

 

16.16.090 Recordation.
     Upon approval of the final map by the council, the city clerk shall execute the appropriate certificate on the certificate sheet and shall, pursuant to the provisions of Map Act Section 66464, transmit the map, or have an authorized agent forward the map, to the county recorder. (Ord. 469 § 1, 1990)

 

16.16.100 Mergers and unmergers.
     A.     The primary purpose of this section is to provide for a merger of parcels upon application of the property owner without the necessity of processing a parcel map. The specific requirements for a city-initiated merger are as follows in compliance with Map Act Section 66451.11.

     B.      Merger Without Final Map.

     1.      Application by Property Owner.

     a.      Upon application by the owner, on a form approved by the engineer, contiguous parcels under the same ownership may be merged without filing a map for reversion to acreage. The form and content of the application and the information, data, fees and other details required for the processing of same, shall be set by council resolution.

     b.      The engineer shall have the authority to approve mergers, and no final map shall be required provided the merger does not involve the following:

     i.       Streets or other easements to be vacated;

     4.      This agreement shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder at the expense of the owner and shall constitute notice to all successors of title to the real property of the obligation set forth, and also a lien in an amount to fully reimburse the city, including interest as set in this section, subject to foreclosure in event of default in payment;

     5.      In event of litigation caused by any default of the owner or successors, the owner or successors agree to pay all costs involved, including reasonable attorneys fees, which shall become a part of the lien against the real property;

The improvements shall be at the subdivider’s expense. In absence of an agreement, the city may require completion of the construction improvements within a reasonable specified time following approval of the final or parcel map upon a finding that completion of the improvements is necessary for the following reasons:

The originals shall be retained by the city.

     2.      Approval by the engineer shall in no way relieve the subdivider or the subdivider’s engineer from responsibility for the design of the improvements and for any error, omission or any deficiency resulting from the design or from any required conditions of approval of the tentative map.

     2.      Security Arrangements.

     a.      The subdivider shall file security to guarantee completion of public and private improvements with the improvement agreement as follows:

     i.       A faithful performance security in an amount deemed sufficient by the engineer to cover up to one hundred percent of the total cost of all required improvements including bonding requirements for grading as outlined in Chapter 15.64;

     ii.      A labor and material security in a like amount;

     iii. A grading security as required by Section 15.64.280;

     iv.     A monumentation security in an amount stipulated by the subdivider’s engineer to cover the cost of placing lot corners and other related monuments;

     v.      If the required subdivision improvements are financed and installed pursuant to special assessment proceedings, upon the furnishing by the contractor of the faithful performance and labor and material security required by the special assessment act being used, the city may reduce the improvement security of the subdivider by an amount corresponding to the amount of the security furnished by the contractor; and

     vi.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the subdivider may satisfy the requirement for security of certain improvements by providing proof that same has been posted with another public agency subject to the approval of the engineer.

     b.      Security may be one of the following types subject to the approval of the city attorney as to kind and form:

     i.       Bonds. All bonds shall be executed by a surety company authorized to transact business as a surety, and have an agent for service in California, together with an “A” policy holder’s rating and a financial rating of at least “V” in compliance with the current “Best’s” ratings.

     ii.      Cash Deposits.

     (A)   In lieu of the faithful performance and labor and material bonds, the subdivider may submit cash deposits under the conditions hereinafter described.

     (B)    Disbursements from cash deposits shall be made in compliance with a separate agreement between the subdivider and the city. A bookkeeping fee of one percent of the total amount deposited with the city for each cash deposit shall be submitted with each security. Disbursements from a cash deposit in any instance shall not be permitted unless and until authorized in writing by the engineer.

     iii. Letter of Credit. In lieu of faithful performance and labor and material bonds or cash deposits, the subdivider may submit a letter of credit subject to the California Commercial Code and under the conditions hereinafter described. The letter of credit shall be issued by a financial institution organized and doing business in and subject to regulation by, the state of California or federal government, in a form and content as approved by the city attorney, and shall pledge that the funds necessary to meet the performance are on deposit and guaranteed for payment and agree that the funds designated by the instrument shall become trust funds for the purposes set forth in the instrument.

     C.      Improvement Agreement Not Required with Special Permit. Should the subdivider desire to do certain work prior to entering into an agreement with the city to install and complete all subdivision improvements and alteration work, the subdivider may make an application to do so under a special permit. This application shall be accompanied by detailed plans, describing the work which is proposed. The director may issue a special permit to the subdivider upon submittal of an application, provided security has been posted in an amount which would insure the rehabilitation of the land, including grading and planting, in the event the subdivision map does not record. The security and contractor’s qualifications shall be in compliance with this section. When the special permit is for all work required in connection with the subdivision and the work has been completed and inspected, an improvement agreement will not be required.

     D.     Release of Security. Security provided may not be released. However, the issuing bank or association will receive a copy of the notice of completion.

     1.      Progress Payments. Progress payments may be made to the subdivider from any deposit money or letter of credit which the subdivider may have made in lieu of providing a security bond; provided, however, that no progress payment shall be made for more than ninety percent of the value of any installment of work and provided that the aggregate amount thus paid is not in excess of fifty percent of the total amount posted as improvement security. No progress payments from cash deposits shall be made except upon certification by the director, the engineer and the subdivider that work covered thereby has been completed.

     2.      Reduction of Security. Following recordation of the notice of completion the labor and material bond shall be retained in full value to secure payment to the contractor, the subcontractors, and to persons renting equipment or furnishing labor or materials for six months. Following the six-month period, the labor and material security may be reduced to an amount not less than the total of all claims on which an action has been filed and notice given in writing to the city.

     3.      Forfeiture of Surety. In the event that subdivider fails to complete all improvement work in compliance with the provisions of this section and the improvement agreement, and the city shall have to complete the same, the city shall call on the security for funds necessary to complete the improvement as reimbursement or shall appropriate from any cash deposit funds for reimbursement. If the amount of any security shall be less than the cost and expense incurred by the city, the subdivider shall be liable to the city for such difference. Any cash remaining in the possession of the city after completion of the improvement, shall be returned to the originator minus normal administrative costs.

     4.      Maintenance Guaranty. The subdivider shall guarantee all public improvements and shall correct any and all defects or deficiencies arising during the period of limitation outlined in Code of Civil Procedure Sections 337 and 337.15, as a result of the acts or omissions of the subdivider, its agents or employees. The maintenance guaranty shall be backed by a bond or cash deposit in the amount of fifteen percent of the surety posted for improvements and be for a period of no less than one year. The city shall provide written notice of the defect or deficiency. In any instance where the subdivider fails to take action within the specified time, or when immediate action is required to protect the public health, safety and/or welfare, the city may cause the work to be performed and call on the surety for reimbursement. The maintenance security shall be submitted prior to final acceptance of the public improvements by the city.

The agreement shall be prepared by the engineer, approved as to form by the city attorney, executed by the subdivider and surety and transmitted to the council for consideration. If approved by the council, the city clerk shall execute the agreement on behalf of the city.

     3.      In consideration of a subdivision improvement agreement extension, the following adjustments may be required:

     a.      Revision of improvement plans to provide for current design and construction standards when required by the engineer;

     b.      Revised improvement construction estimates to reflect current improvement costs as approved by the engineer;

     c.      Increase of improvement securities in compliance with revised construction estimates;

17.01.020 Purpose of zoning provisions.
     This title implements the policies of the Rancho Mirage general plan by classifying and regulating the uses of land and structures within the city of Rancho Mirage. This title is adopted to protect and to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare of residents, and businesses in the city. Additional purposes of this title are to:

     A.     Implement the goals, objectives, policies and programs of the Rancho Mirage general plan, and to manage future growth and development in compliance with that plan;

     B.      Provide standards for the orderly growth and development of the city that will maintain the community’s unique characteristics in appropriate locations;

     C.      Require high quality planning and design for development, that enhances the visual character of the city, avoids conflicts between land uses, and preserves the scenic qualities of the city;

     D.     Conserve and protect the natural resources of the city, its natural beauty and significant environmental amenities; and

     E.      Create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land uses upon which to plan transportation, water supply, sewerage and other public facilities and utilities. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.01.030 Authority and general plan consistency.
     A.     Authority. This title is enacted based on the authority vested in the city of Rancho Mirage by the state of California, including but not limited to the State Constitution; 65800 and subsequent sections of the California Government Code; the California Environmental Quality Act, Subdivision Map Act, and the Health and Safety Code.

     B.      Implement General Plan Consistency. This title is the primary tool used by the city of Rancho Mirage to implement the goals, objectives, policies, and programs of the Rancho Mirage general plan. The Rancho Mirage city council intends that this title be consistent with the Rancho Mirage general plan, and that any land use, subdivision, or development approved in compliance with this title will also be consistent with the Rancho Mirage general plan. A proposed use is considered to be consistent with the general plan when the following conditions exist:

     1.      The proposed use is compatible with the description of the land use element designation in which the use is located, as shown by the land use element map, and as described in the text of the general plan;

     2.      The proposed use is in conformance with the goals, objectives, policies, plans, programs, maps, and guidelines and the intent of the Rancho Mirage general plan; and

     3.      The proposed use is to be established and maintained in a manner which is consistent with all elements of the general plan and all applicable provisions contained therein. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.01.040 Relationship to California Environmental Quality Act.
     All projects subject to the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) shall be reviewed in compliance with the provisions of this title and State law (Public Resources Code 21000 et. seq., and Code of Regulations 15000 et. seq.). (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.01.050 Applicability of the zoning ordinance.
     This title applies to all land uses, structures, subdivisions, lot line adjustments, and development within the city of Rancho Mirage, as follows.

     A.     New Land Uses or Structures, Changes to Land Uses or Structures. It shall be unlawful, and a violation of this title, for any person to establish, construct, reconstruct, alter, or replace any use of land or structure, except in compliance with the requirements of Section 17.04.020 (Requirements for Development and New Land Uses), and Chapter 17.70 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels).

     B.      Issuance of Construction Permits. Building, grading, or other construction permits may be issued by the department only when the proposed land use and/or structure satisfy the requirements of subsection A above, and the director determines that the site was subdivided in compliance with Municipal Code Title 16 (Subdivisions).

     C.      Subdivision of Land. Any subdivision of land proposed within the city of Rancho Mirage after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title shall be consistent with the minimum parcel size requirements of Division II (Zoning Districts), the subdivision requirements of Municipal Code Title 16 (Subdivisions), and all other applicable requirements of this title.

     D.     Continuation of an Existing Land Use. An existing land use is lawful and not in violation only when operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable provisions of this title. The requirements of this title are not retroactive in their effect on a land use that was lawfully established before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title or any applicable amendment. A use that was legally established but does not fully comply with all of the requirements of this title may be maintained in compliance with Chapter 17.70 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels).

     E.      Effect of Zoning Ordinance Changes on Projects in Progress. The requirements imposed through this title or amendments to those requirements are applicable to subsequent or pending applications, unless rights to develop in a manner inconsistent with those requirements have vested in compliance with state law.

     F.      Other Requirements May Still Apply. Nothing in this title eliminates the need for obtaining any other approvals required by the city, or approvals required by other provisions of the Municipal Code or the regulations of a city department, or county, regional, state, or federal agency.

     G.     Conflicting Approvals and Licenses to Be Void. From and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, any approvals issued in conflict with the provisions of this title shall be void. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.01.060 Responsibility for administration.
     This title shall be administered by the Rancho Mirage city council, planning commission, community development director, and the community development department, in compliance with Chapter 17.66 (Administrative Responsibility). (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.01.070 Partial Invalidation of Zoning Ordinance.
     If any title, article, chapter, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this title is held to be invalid, unconstitutional or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, these decisions shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this title. The Rancho Mirage city council hereby declares that this title and each title, article, chapter, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion would have been adopted irrespective of the fact that one or more portions of this title may be declared invalid, unconstitutional, or unenforceable.

Time limits will extend to the following working day where the last of the specified number of days falls on a weekend or holiday.

     4.      Minimum Requirements. When interpreting and applying the regulations of this title, all provisions shall be considered to be minimum requirements, unless stated otherwise (e.g., height limits and site coverage requirements for structures, and the numbers and size of signs allowed are maximums, not minimums.

     5.      State Law Requirements. Where this title references applicable provisions of state law (e.g., the California Government Code, Subdivision Map Act, Public Resources Code, etc.), the reference shall be construed to be to the applicable state law provisions as they may be amended from time to time.

     B.      Authority. The director is assigned the responsibility and authority to interpret the requirements of this title. The directors determination may be appealed to the commission in compliance with Chapter 17.76 (Appeals).

     2.      Applicable Standards and Requirements.

The city shall not enforce private covenants or agreements, unless they contain provisions that are required as a condition of approval by the city. Only those provisions required as a condition of approval shall be subject to enforcement by the city. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

     B.      General Development Standards.

     1.      Site Divided by Zoning District Boundary. Where a site is divided by one or more district boundaries, the site shall be developed in compliance with the requirements of each district, as applicable.

     2.      Zoning of Vacated Streets and Alleys. Where a public street or alley is officially vacated, the zoning regulations applicable to the abutting property shall apply to the vacated street or alley. If the parcel line is extended to the centerline of the former public street or alley as a result of the vacation, the applicable zoning district boundary shall conform to the new parcel line.

     3.      Conflicts Between Provisions.

     a.      In the event of any conflict between the zoning district regulations of this division and the provisions of Division III (Development and Operational Standards), the provisions of Division III shall control; and

     b.      In the event of any conflict between the zoning district regulations of this division and the provisions of any applicable development agreement or specific plan, the provisions of the development agreement or specific plan shall control.

     C.      Consolidated Parcels in Two Zoning Districts. In the event two or more parcels are proposed for consolidation in compliance with Title 16 (Subdivisions) of the Municipal Code, so that a single parcel is covered by two or more zoning districts, the application for adjustment or map approval shall be accompanied by an application for rezoning of the parcel into a single zoning district. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

Chapter 17.08 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
17.08.010 Purpose.
     A.     Residential Zoning Districts. This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and new land uses in the residential zoning districts established by Section 17.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The purpose of this chapter is to achieve the following:

     1.      Preserve and enhance the predominately low density, high quality residential character of the city, while providing a variety of housing opportunities to accommodate existing and future residents;

     2.      Ensure that existing residential neighborhoods and surrounding vacant lands are developed in a manner that preserves neighborhood character, establishes neighborhood identity and provides a consistent and compatible land use pattern;

     3.      Ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space for each dwelling;

     4.      Minimize traffic congestion and avoid the overloading of public services and utilities;

     5.      Facilitate the provision of public improvements commensurate with anticipated increase in population, dwelling unit densities, and service requirements; and

     6.      Protect residential neighborhoods from excessive noise, illumination, unsightliness, odor, smoke and other objectionable influences.

     B.      Individual Zoning Districts. The purposes of the individual residential zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows:

     1.      HR (Hillside Reserve) Zone. The HR zoning district identifies hillside areas appropriate for limited single-family uses on privately owned land while preserving scenic resources. The maximum allowable density is one unit per six hundred forty acres. The HR zoning district is intended to allow limited residential development between open space and higher density residential uses, and to preclude inappropriate expansion of urban development on hillside land subject to environmental constraints or possessing resource values. The HR zoning district is consistent with the hillside reserve land use designation of the general plan;

     2.      R-E (Residential Estate) Zone. The R-E zoning district identifies areas appropriate for low density, large lot single-family uses. The allowable maximum density is one dwelling unit per net acre. The R-E zoning district is intended to provide for lower density development and lower densities with open space areas to encourage a rural and estate character. The R-E zoning district is consistent with the residential estates land use designation of the general plan;

     3.      R-L-2 (Residential Very Low Density) Zone. The R-L-2 zoning district identifies areas appropriate for large lot single-family uses. The allowable maximum density is two dwelling units per gross acre. The R-L-2 zoning district is intended to provide for single-family parcels ranging from fifteen thousand to twenty thousand square feet or larger, or similar density country club type development. The R-L-2 zoning district is consistent with the low density residential land use designation of the general plan;

     4.      R-L-3 (Residential Low Density) Zone. The R-L-3 zoning district identifies areas appropriate for single-family uses. The allowable maximum density is three units per gross acre. The R-L-3 zoning district is intended to provide for moderately low density development in a single-family setting. The R-L-3 zoning district is consistent with the low density residential land use designation of the general plan;

     5.      R-M (Residential Medium Density) Zone. The R-M zoning district identifies areas appropriate for a variety of housing types. The allowable maximum density is four units per gross acre. The R-M zoning district is intended to encourage the development of a variety of residential development, including garden apartments and affordable housing. The R-M zoning district is consistent with the medium density residential land use designation of the general plan;

     6.      R-H (Residential High Density) Zone. The R-H zoning district identifies areas appropriate for the greatest diversity of residential development, including attached single- and multi-family uses. The allowable density range is from five to nine units per gross acre. This zoning district is most suitable for affordable and senior housing, including apartments and condominiums. The R-H zoning district is consistent with the high density residential land use designation of the general plan; and

 

     7.      MHP (Mobile Home Park) Zone. The MHP zoning district identifies areas appropriate for the accommodation of mobile homes, including manufactured housing, in planned residential developments. The allowable density range is from five to nine units per gross acre. The MHP zoning district is consistent with the mobile home park land use designation of the general plan. (Ord. 1020 § 2, 2011; Ord. 935 § 2, 2006; Ord. 845 § 1, 2003; Ord. 832 § 1(a), 2003; Ord. 814 § 1, 2002; Ord. 777 § 1 Exh. A, 2002)

17.08.012 Allowable residential zone uses, permit requirements and project review authority.
     Allowable land uses within residential zoning districts are indicated in Table 2-2 by permit requirement. Review authority for development projects is also provided. In the event that future land use is unknown for a development project the city council shall be the review authority.

     1.      C-N (Neighborhood Commercial) Zone. The C-N zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for neighborhood-scale shopping centers compatible with adjacent residential areas, including supermarkets and drugstores on sites generally eight to ten acres in size providing approximately a maximum of eighty thousand to one hundred thousand square feet of gross floor area. The C-N zoning district is consistent with the neighborhood commercial land use designation of the general plan;

     2.      C-G (General Commercial) Zone. The C-G zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for a variety of smaller commercial centers, specialty retail shops, including, but not limited to, a broad range of specialty retail shops, clothing and apparel, jewelry stores, and personal service businesses on sites generally two to eight acres in size. The C-G zoning district is consistent with the general commercial land use designation of the general plan;

     3.      C-C (Community Commercial) Zone. The C-C zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for larger, community-scale shopping centers and malls, which may be anchored by several department stores or other large-scale retail outlets, restaurants, hotels, and entertainment uses. The standard size of development ranges from one hundred thousand to four hundred thousand square feet in gross floor area, and requires approval of a specific plan. The C-C zoning district is consistent with the community commercial land use designation of the general plan;

     4.      O (Office Commercial) Zone. The O zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for professional office uses including administrative, corporate, financial, government, institutional, legal, and medical. The O zoning district is consistent with the office land use designation of the general plan;

     5.      M-U (Mixed Use) Zone. The M-U zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for the integration of commercial, office and residential uses, and subject to the approval of a specific plan to ensure compatible design standards, shared internal circulation, and related considerations. The M-U zoning district is consistent with the mixed use commercial land use designation of the general plan;

     6.      Rs-H (Resort Hotel) Zone. The Rs-H zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for hotels and destination resorts, including condo-hotel projects, with limited ancillary commercial uses, including restaurants and health spas that directly support the primary use. The Rs-H zoning district is consistent with the resort hotel land use designation of the general plan;

     7.      I-L (Light Industrial) Zone. The I-L zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for business parks and industrial uses within enclosed structures with limited screened outdoor storage, including warehousing and distribution facilities, mini-warehouse storage, and a variety of light manufacturing uses. The I-L zoning district is consistent with the light industrial land use designation of the general plan; and

     8.      R-I-C (Regional Interstate Commercial) Zone. The R-I-C zoning district is applied to areas as defined in Table 2-4. (Ord. 1045 § 2, 2012; Ord. 932 § 4, 2006; Ord. 845 § 3, 2003; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 17.10.012 Allowable commercial and industrial zone uses, permit requirements and project review authority.
     Allowable land uses within commercial and industrial zoning districts are indicated in Table 2-4 by permit requirement. Review authority for development projects is also provided. In the event that future land use is unknown for a development project the city council shall be the review authority. Uses that are not identified are considered “not allowed.”

Chapter 17.12 SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS
17.12.010 Purpose.
     This chapter provides regulations applicable to development and new land uses in the special purpose zoning districts established by Section 17.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The purposes of the individual special purpose zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows:

     A.     P (Institutional) Zone. The P-zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for a variety of public uses, including city hall, educational facilities, hospitals, libraries, police and fire, and other public agency facilities which may require appropriate buffering from adjacent residential designations.

Chapter 17.14 OVERLAY DISTRICTS
17.14.010 Purpose.
     This chapter provides guidance for development and new land uses in addition to the standards and regulations of the primary zoning district, where important area, neighborhood or site characteristics require particular attention in project planning. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.14.020 Applicability.
     The applicability of any overlay zoning district to specific sites is illustrated by the overlay zoning map symbol established by Section 17.06.010 (Zoning Districts Established). The provisions of this chapter apply to development and new uses in addition to all other applicable requirements of this title. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other provision of this title, this chapter shall control. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.14.030 Overlay districts.
     The overlay districts include the following:

     A.     S-OL (Senior Overlay) Zone. The S-OL Overlay is established to designate appropriate areas possessing special circumstances or conditions that support the provision of senior housing, including proximity to commercial, medical, transportation, or other senior-related uses. The S-OL Overlay is intended to be used in conjunction with any residential base zoning district, and may be deemed consistent with any residential land use designation of the general plan.

     1.      The Senior Overlay shall be applied in conjunction with any residential base zoning district to allow use of the special senior group housing design standards in compliance with Sections 17.30.040 (Assisted Living Facilities) and 17.30.210 (Senior Congregate Care Housing Facilities). Senior housing units designed as an active retirement community consistent with conventional design standards, rather than the special senior group housing design standards, do not require a Senior Overlay.

     2.      The Senior Overlay provides incentives for the development of a wide variety of specialized housing designed for and restricted to residents over the age of fifty-five. Special senior housing design standards are contained in Section 17.30.210 (Senior Congregate Care Housing Facilities), and include allowance for reduced parking requirements and smaller living units.

     3.      The following senior housing residential facility shall be allowed:

     a.      Congregate Housing. Projects in this category may include housing units with common facilities, including dining, activity centers, and community services. Offered services may include meals, security, emergency call monitoring, housekeeping, and resident transportation. Units may include kitchenettes rather than kitchens. Meals may be provided as part of a service package in a common dining room. Outdoor amenities shall be required.

     B.      S-P (Specific Plan Overlay) Zone. The S-P Overlay is established to designate areas subject to the provisions of an adopted specific plan, in compliance with Chapter 17.54. The S-P Overlay is intended to be used in conjunction with an appropriate base zone, and may be deemed consistent with one or more land use designations of the general plan.

     1.      The preparation and approval of a specific plan shall be in compliance with State law (Government Code Section 65450 et seq.) and Chapter 17.54. However, the director may allow a small parcel within a S-P Overlay area, where no specific plan had been adopted, to develop without the requirement for a specific plan.

     2.      In the M-U zoning district, the specific plan shall also address the following:

     a.      A market/feasibility analysis;

     b.      Privacy and security;

     c.      Integration of residential and commercial uses; and

     d.      The appropriate maximum density of residential areas, where applicable.

     C.      R-M-TOL (Medium Density Transitional Overlay) Zone. This R-M Transitional Overlay is established to provide for residential development in a transitional area of the city between industrial/high density areas and low density country club developments. The following design standards are applicable only within R-M-TOL zone. Detached single-family housing is the only allowable development in the R-M-TOL zone and is subject to city review. The units shall be constructed in the following manner:

     1.      The house design where the distance between structures is less than twenty feet shall include a hip roof along the side yards.

     2.      Lots with lot coverage greater than thirty percent shall have a minimum of one thousand square feet usable open space in the rear yards.

     3.      The second story element of any two-story house shall have a minimum setback of twenty feet for both front and rear yards.

     4.      Lots utilizing the minimum fifteen foot front yard setback shall have no more than forty percent of the lot frontage at the fifteen foot limit. The remainder of the building shall be set back a minimum of twenty feet.

     5.      The average size lot shall be greater than seven thousand one hundred fifty square feet. No lot shall be smaller than six thousand two hundred square feet.

     D.     SC (Special Corner) Zone. This section provides exceptionally designed commercial and/or office centers at key intersections in the city where aesthetics and land use compatibility are of primary importance. The following design standards and guidelines are applicable in the SC overlay. The SC overlay is intended to be used in conjunction with any nonresidential base zoning district at designated intersections. Projects approved in SC overlay zones must satisfy all the SC standards and guidelines and findings must be adopted demonstrating full compliance with the standards and guidelines.

     1.      SC Standards.

     a.      The minimum distance from the curb at the main intersection inward to the parking area, measured at a forty- five degree angle, shall be ninety feet. The minimum distance to a building shall be one hundred twenty-two feet.

     b.      Minimum landscape parkway width between curb and parking shall be forty-five feet except for local streets which shall be twenty-five feet.

     c.      All buildings shall be a minimum of eighty-five feet from arterial and collector road curbs and thirty-five feet from local street curbs.

     d.      Where dedicated right turn lanes, deceleration or acceleration lanes are required, the minimum parkway width shall be measured from the location of the original curb line.

     e.      All parking and circulation areas shall be continuously screened from public streets to a height of four feet, by a combination of walls, berms, boulders and hedges.

     f.       For parcels smaller than five net acres, required overlay setbacks and parkway widths shall be proportionally reduced but in no case shall be less than the minimum setbacks or minimum parkway widths required of the underlying zoning district.

     2.      SC Guidelines.

     a.      A minimum ten foot wide landscape band with or without pedestrian path access should be provided around all buildings.

     b.      Pedestrian plazas or courtyard placed in building clusters are encouraged, and shall carry forth the theme established with the corner treatment.

     c.      Where possible, placing parking areas lower than adjacent roadways is encouraged, with intent to reduce their visual impact and to screen the parking from the adjacent roadway.

     d.      Shade structures in the form of landscaped trellises are encouraged as an added method of providing parking lot and pedestrian area shade.

     e.      Parking Aplaza@ landscaping should be vertically layered through the creation of an overstory of palms, a mid-story of canopy trees and an understory of shrubs and groundcover.

     f.       Building architecture and design should be compatible and themed with adjacent office and commercial developments. Franchise architecture shall not be permitted. Building design shall be of the highest quality consistent with the Rancho Mirage desert environment.

     g.      Large expanses of blank walls shall be avoided. Simple box like architecture shall be avoided. Wall planes shall be treated with architectural relief to provide interest and visual depth.

     h.      No signs, neon or otherwise, shall be visible through windows.

     i.       Enhanced pavement shall be placed at key locations, subject to city approval.

     j.       Special corner landscape and hardscape treatment shall be provided.

     k.      Hardscape and sidewalks shall be in color harmony with the landscaped theme.

     l.       Pedestrian connections shall be provided between buildings and parking areas. Projects are encouraged to exceed CVWD water efficiency goals by ten percent. (Ord. 884, Exh. A, 2004; Ord. 868A, Exh. A, 2004; Ord. 848 Exh. A, 2003; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

Division III. Development and Operational Standards
Chapter 17.16 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
17.16.010 Purpose.
     This Division expands upon the standards of Division II (Zoning Districts) by addressing the details of site planning and project design. These standards are intended to ensure that all development:

     A.     Produces a resort/residential desert community with a high quality design;

     B.      Is compatible with existing and future development; and

     C.      Protects the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties, consistent with general plan. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.16.020 Applicability.
     The provisions of this Division apply to all proposed development and new land uses.

     A.     These standards shall be considered in combination with the standards for each zoning district in Division II (Zoning Districts). If there is a conflict, the standards specific to the applicable zoning district shall override these performance and general standards, except where these standards provide otherwise.

     B.      All new or modified uses and structures shall comply with all applicable provisions of this division. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

Chapter 17.18 GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
17.18.010 Purpose.
     This chapter provides performance standards that are designed to minimize and mitigate various potential adverse operational impacts of development and new land uses within the city, and promote compatibility with adjoining areas and land uses. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.18.020 Applicability.
     The provisions of this chapter apply to all new and existing land uses, including permanent and temporary uses, in all zoning districts unless an exemption is specifically provided. Existing uses on the effective date of this chapter shall not be altered or modified thereafter to conflict with these standards. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.18.030 Air pollution.
     A.     Emissions. Uses, activities, and processes shall not be operated in a manner that produces significant, harmful air pollution emissions or impacts.

     1.      Scheduling. Grading activities shall be scheduled to ensure that repeated grading would not be required, and that implementation of the proposed land use would occur as soon as possible after grading. If construction does not occur immediately after grading is completed, all distributed areas shall be treated with a soil stabilizer, subject to the approval of the director.

     2.      Operations During High Winds. Clearing, earth transport, excavation operations, or grading activities shall cease when the wind speed exceeds twenty-five miles per hour averaged over one hour, in compliance with Municipal Code Chapter 15.64 (Grading).

     3.      Area of Disturbance. The area disturbed by clearing, demolition, earth-transport, excavation operations, or grading shall be the minimum required to implement the allowed land use.

     4.      Dust Control. During clearing, demolition, earth-transport, excavation operations, or grading, dust emissions shall be controlled by regular watering, paving of construction roads, or other dust-preventive measures (e.g., hydroseeding, etc.), subject to the approval of the Director, and in compliance with Municipal Code Chapters 7.01 (Control of PM10, Fugitive Dust and Other Emissions) and 15.64 (Grading).

     a.      Material(s) excavated or graded shall be watered to prevent blowing dust. Watering, with complete coverage, shall occur at least twice daily, and as frequently as required to prevent blowing dust.

     b.      Material(s) transported off-site shall be either sufficiently watered or securely covered to prevent dust.

     5.      On-Site Roads. On-site roads shall be paved as soon as feasible. During construction, unpaved roads shall be watered periodically, and/or shall be chemically stabilized.

     6.      Ground Treatment. Graded areas shall be revegetated or treated within ninety days of grading completion to minimize dust and erosion. Portions of the construction site to remain inactive longer than ninety days shall be seeded and watered until grass cover is grown and maintained.

     C.      Exhaust Emissions. An applicant who proposes a land use activity that could result in potential construction-related exhaust emission impacts shall minimize the emissions by maintaining equipment engines in good condition and in proper tune in compliance with manufacturers specifications. Construction equipment shall not be left idling for extended periods of time. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A, 2002))

 

17.18.040 Electrical interference and radioactivity.

Chapter 17.20 GENERAL PROPERTY AND USE STANDARDS
17.20.010 Purpose.
     This chapter provides a general standards intended to ensure that new or modified uses and development would produce a resort/residential desert environment of a high quality which is harmonious with existing and future development, and protects the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties, consistent with the general plan. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.20.020 Applicability.
     All new or modified uses and structures (including changes in use) shall conform with all of the following standards before construction, change in use, or during normal operations unless specifically exempted. These standards apply to more than one zoning district, and therefore, are combined in this chapter. Also these standards shall be applied in construction with the standards located in the specific zoning districts identified in Division II (Zoning Districts). (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.20.030 Access.
     Every use or structure shall have frontage upon a public street or permanent means of access to a public street by way of a public or private easement, or recorded reciprocal access agreement. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.20.040 Development/design considerations.
     The following standards are in addition to the specific development standards contained in the individual zoning districts identified in Division II (Zoning Districts).

     A.     The proposed development shall be of a quality and character which is consistent with any adopted design guidelines and policies including bulk, colors, compatibility, height, materials, roofpitch, scale, and the preservation of privacy.

     B.      The project design shall improve community appearance by avoiding excessive variety and monotonous repetition.

     C.      Proposed signs and landscaping shall be integral design elements which do not overwhelm or dominate the project.

     D.     Exterior lighting shall be energy efficient, stationary, shielded and directed away from all adjoining properties and public rights-of-way in compliance with Section 17.18.050 (Exterior glare, heat, and light).

     E.      Mechanical equipment, storage, trash areas, and utilities shall be located out of public view or architecturally screened to the satisfaction of the director. The design of all buildings shall incorporate provisions for screening of all ground and roof-mounted mechanical equipment. Said equipment shall be screened from view from adjacent public rights-of-way and surrounding private property. In order to ensure screening of roof-mounted mechanical equipment, the elevations, cross-sections and construction plans shall clearly demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning division and building official that the roof-mounted equipment will be at or below parapet height or approved architectural screening device.

     F.      Site access, parking, loading, and drive aisles shall be designed to be safe and efficient.

     G.     The proposed development shall be designed to protect sensitive land uses by promoting a harmonious and compatible transition in terms of scale and character between areas of different land uses/zoning districts.

     H.     All structure elevations shall be architecturally treated and enhanced appropriate to the structure’s use and surrounding structures and uses.

 

     I.       Accessory structures, including parking structures, shall be architecturally compatible with both the main (on-site) and surrounding structures.

     J.       Both sides of all perimeter walls or fences shall be architecturally treated.

     K.     Additions and alterations to existing structures shall be substantially the same in appearance (or an improvement, if determined necessary by the director) as the original, to the greatest extent possible, especially use of exterior color, materials, and roof line(s).

     L.      Except for single-family parcels, no portion of a parcel shall be unimproved at the time of occupancy. All unpaved areas shall be graded, planted, and properly maintained at all times in compliance with Chapter 17.24 (Landscaping Standards). (Ord. 1023 § 2, 2011; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.20.050 Environmental compliance regulations.
     All development proposals shall be evaluated in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.20.060 Exterior structure walls.
     Structure walls tend to be the main architectural and visual feature in any development. Consequently, the following standards shall apply to all exterior structure wall construction.

     A.     Structure Wall Materials. The number of permissible finish materials shall be limited. The harmony of materials and particularly color treatment is essential to achieve unity in the project. Because the desert setting suggests a textured wall surface, the recommended exterior wall finish materials are textured stucco, concrete, or concrete blocks. Stucco coloring in residential developments and concrete coloring in other structures shall be restricted to being generally light in tone.

     B.      Prohibited Elements. The following elements are deemed unacceptable in any development and shall be prohibited:

     1.      Nonanodized and unpainted aluminum finished window frame;

     2.      Metal grilles and façades; however, grilles and facades of unique design and in keeping with the general decor of the development and neighborhood may be allowed subject to the approval of the director;

     3.      Aluminum or other metal panels, or reflective mirror type glass windows or panels.

     C.      Maintenance. Exterior walls shall be constructed, treated, and maintained in compliance with Municipal Code Section 8.16.075 (Graffiti prevention and removal). (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.20.070 Fences, hedges, and walls.
     The following standards shall apply to the installation of all fences, hedges, and walls.

     A.     On a corner parcel, no fence, hedge, sign, wall or other structure, shrubbery, mounds of earth, or other visual obstruction over thirty-six inches in height above the nearest street curb elevation shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow within a traffic safety-sight area. (See Figure 3-x.) This provision shall not apply to public utility poles; trees trimmed (to the trunk) to a line at least six feet above the elevation of the intersection; saplings or plant species of open growth habits and not planted in the form of a hedge, which are so planted and trimmed as to leave, at all seasons, a clear and unobstructed crossview; supporting members of appurtenances to permanent structures existing on the date that this title becomes effective; and official warning signs or signals, including utility boxes.

     B.      Except for custom single-family residences located within private gated developments, a maximum six-foot high fence, or wall may be located anywhere on a parcel except in a traffic safety-sight area, required front setback or street-side setback. The maximum height of fences and walls within the required front or street side yard setback shall be thirty-six inches. The maximum height of any obstruction within a safety sight triangle shall also be thirty-six inches or as required by other provisions of this title. An exception to this provision is the allowance of fencing required by the state for the purpose of enclosing swimming pools, spas, and other bodies of water over twenty-four inches in depth, in which case the fencing may encroach up to five feet into the required front setback and may be up to six feet in height.

     Custom single-family residences located within private gated developments may have up to a six-foot high architectural wall or fence located within the required front yard setback provided that the wall or fence is located at least ten feet away from the property line and permitted by the applicable CC&Rs and approved by the applicable HOA. To decrease the visual impact of the height of the wall/fence in relation to the street, a one-foot high earthen mound or planter box shall be installed. For walls less than five feet high, mounding is not required. Vehicle access gates may be located within the front yard setback but shall not be less than seventeen feet from the front property line provided they are allowed by the HOA and approved by the Fire Marshal.

     All fencing and walls shall be constructed of stone, masonry, or wrought iron. Alternative materials may be considered by the Director provided all the following requirements are met to the Director’s satisfaction:

     1.      Material is of high quality;

     2.      Material is painted or architecturally treated on both sides;

     3.      Material complements the architectural design of the associated residence;

     4.      Any existing onsite fencing is upgraded, where necessary, to match the new material.

     Another exception to this provision is the allowance of heightened perimeter walls and fencing for security purposes, in compliance with Section 17.20.120 (Private community walls and gates).

     C.      When there is a difference in the ground level between two adjoining parcels, the height of any fence or wall constructed along the common property line shall be determined using the finished grade of the highest contiguous parcel.

     D.     Only one type of fence or wall design shall be allowed on any one parcel or development. The design may include an appropriate mix of materials subject to the approval of the director. As an exception to this provision wrought iron fencing may be used to enclose a pool and/or spa, although wrought iron is not used elsewhere on the subject site; and enhanced security wall and fencing, in compliance with Section 17.20.120 (Private community walls and gates), may utilize a mixture of wall and fence types, subject to approval of the director.

     G.     Chain link fencing shall be allowed only as follows:

     1.      In the R-E zoning district where the fencing is located on the property line and planted with vegetation that would screen the fence from adjacent properties and public areas;

     2.      In conjunction with approved tennis courts, private and commercial, in any zoning district;

     3.      Where it is required by any law or regulation of the city or applicable state agency;

     4.      For the purpose of increased security where existing landscaping would totally screen the full height of the proposed fence;

     5.      To provide a barrier between bighorn sheep habitat and developed areas of the city;

     6.      Significant exposure of existing chain link fencing to the general public shall not be allowed and shall cause the nonconforming fencing to be removed. The director shall have the authority to determine whether or not a nonconforming fence is significantly exposed to public view. Chain link fences shall be removed within two hundred seventy days of receipt of a city notice, unless a discretionary extension of time is granted by the review authority, subject to the approval of an Abatement Agreement, in compliance with Municipal Code Title 14 “Code Compliance and Remedies”;

     7.      If an exposed chain link fence is determined by the director to be unsightly due to instability, damage, or weathering, the fencing shall either be aligned, stabilized, repaired, and refurbished to an appearance acceptable to the director or shall be removed within sixty days of receipt of city notification;

     8.      Where a perimeter chain link fence has been removed a new conforming fence or wall shall be immediately installed as replacement fencing around walled or gated communities. The replacement fencing and any new or replacement parkway landscaping shall be in compliance with a development plan permit modification approved by the commission;

     9.      In the event that removal of landscaping and nonconforming fencing results in a parkway that is devoid of landscaping, the parkway shall be landscaped in compliance with Section 17.24.050 (Parkway treatment standards).

     H.     Deteriorated or unsightly walls which are exposed to public view shall be restored to an appearance similar to their original condition within sixty days of receipt of city notification.

     The following standards are intended to ensure that the use, handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances comply with all applicable state laws (Government Code Section 65850.2 and Health and Safety Code Section 25505 et seq.). It is not the intent of these provisions to impose additional restrictions on the management of hazardous wastes, which would be contrary to state law, but only to require reporting of information to the city that shall be provided to other public agencies.

     For the purposes of this section, hazardous substances shall include all substances on the comprehensive master list of hazardous substances compiled and maintained by the California Department of Health Services.

     A.     Permit Required. A conditional use permit in compliance with Chapter 17.48 shall be required for any new commercial, industrial, institutional, or accessory use, or major addition (over twenty-five percent) to an existing use, that involves the manufacture, storage, handling, or processing of hazardous substances in sufficient quantities that would require permits as hazardous chemicals under the Uniform Fire Code, with the following exceptions:

     1.      Underground storage of bulk flammable and combustible liquids; or

 

     2.      Hazardous substances in container sizes of ten gallons or less that are stored or maintained for the purpose of retail or wholesale sales.

     B.      Response Plans. All businesses required by state law (Health and Safety Code, Chapter 10.95) to prepare hazardous materials release response plans shall submit copies of these plans, including any revisions, to the director at the same time these plans are submitted to the fire department which is responsible for administering these provisions.

     2.      Notify the fire department and the director of any proposed abandoning, closing, or ceasing operation of an underground storage tank and the actions to be taken to dispose of any hazardous substances.

     D.     Above-Ground Storage. Above-ground storage tanks for any flammable liquids shall be allowed, subject to the approval of the fire department.

     E.      Setbacks from Natural Gas or Petroleum Pipelines.

     1.      All structures subject to the provisions of this title as well as all newly created parcels shall be designed to accommodate a setback of at least one hundred feet from any existing natural gas or petroleum pipeline (see definition in subsection (E)(2)). This setback may be reduced, only if the director can make one or more of the following findings:

 

     a.      The structure would be protected from the radiant heat of an explosion by berming or other physical barriers;

     b.      A one hundred-foot setback would be impractical or unnecessary because of existing topography, streets, parcel lines, or easements; or

     c.      A hazardous liquid containment system or other mitigating facility shall be constructed, and the city engineer finds that a leak would accumulate within the reduced setback area. The design of the system shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer.

     2.      For the purpose of this subsection, a pipeline shall be defined as follows:

     a.      A pipe with a nominal diameter of six inches or more, that is used to transport hazardous liquid, but does not include a pipe used to transport or store hazardous liquid within a refinery, storage, or manufacturing facility; or

     b.      A pipe with a nominal diameter of six inches or more operated at a pressure of more than two hundred seventy-five pounds for each square inch that carries gas.

     3.      A subdivider of a development within five hundred feet of a pipeline shall notify a new or potential owner at the time of purchase and at the close of escrow of the location, size, and type of pipeline. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

     A.     Additional Height Restrictions. In all zoning districts the maximum building height shall not exceed twenty feet as measured from the “finished grade” to the highest point of the structure, excluding chimneys and vents. The number of stories shall be limited to one story (unless otherwise provided in this section) when meeting applicable setback requirements. However, this building height may be increased and up to one additional story may be permitted by the council as part of a development plan application, subject to the following:

     1.      In addition to the minimum required setbacks, the setbacks shall be increased at a minimum rate of two feet for each one foot of additional building height above twenty feet, which shall be measured from the property line to each portion of the building that exceeds twenty feet; however, the council in exercising their discretion may require significantly greater setbacks.

     2.      Enhanced buffering to surrounding properties and the appropriateness of understructure parking shall be evaluated and related conditions of approval may be imposed by the council to mitigate any potential negative impacts on surrounding properties.

     3.      A visual and spatial analysis relating building proportions, massing, height, and setback shall be conducted to preserve and enhance the scenic viewshed and related conditions of approval may be imposed by the council to mitigate any potential negative impacts on scenic viewsheds.

     4.      The need and appropriateness of the additional height shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council.

     5.      Compatibility and harmony with surrounding development, land uses designations, and zoning shall be demonstrated subject to the satisfaction of the council and related conditions of approval may be imposed by the council to mitigate any potential negative impacts on the compatibility and harmony with surrounding development, land use designations, and zoning.

     B.      Amendments. Any amendment to this section relating to residential development must be approved by a majority of the voters voting at an election.

     A.     In all zoning districts, any new development or remodel construction valued at fifty percent or more of the assessed valuation of the main structure as determined by the city building official shall require the dedication of the public right-of-way for public street purposes and the construction of the public street improvements as required by the city engineer, in a manner consistent with the general plan.

     B.      The needed public right-of-way and/or public street improvement shall reflect an essential nexus (e.g., an identifiable relationship) between the dedication and/or improvement and a legitimate government interest.

     C.      The city engineer may determine that a security or cash-in-lieu of construction may be paid for the public street improvement(s) to occur at a future date, as solely determined by the city engineer. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.20.140 Screening and buffering.
     This section establishes standards for the screening, buffering, and separation of adjoining residential and nonresidential land uses.

     A.     Screening Between Different Land Uses. Wherever a parcel zoned for commercial, industrial, or institutional purposes adjoins a residential zoning district/use, at the time of nonresidential construction there shall be erected along the property line adjoining the residential zoning district/use a six-foot high solid decorative wall with a stucco or equivalent finish. The wall shall be architecturally treated on both sides, subject to the approval of the director. The wall separating the nonresidential use from adjoining residential use/district may exceed six feet, up to a maximum of eight feet in height for increased screening, as measured from the finished grade of the affected residential property, if all of the following requirements are met:

     1.      Walls exceeding six feet in height shall be subject to approval or modification of a development plan permit;

     2.      Increased wall heights shall be allowed where additional height is necessary to protect the privacy of residents from intrusive elements of adjacent nonresidential development;

     3.      Increased wall heights shall be allowed only in locations where existing or future residents’ mountain views would not be adversely impacted; and

     4.      Walls exceeding six feet in height may be installed only if all structural requirements are met as determined by the city building official.

     B.      Mechanical Equipment. Any mechanical equipment, whether on the roof, side of structure, or ground, shall be properly screened from public view. The method of screening shall be architecturally compatible in terms of colors, materials, shape, and size. The screening design and construction shall be subject to the approval of the director and shall blend with the design of the structure and include appropriately installed and maintained landscaping when on the ground. In addition, mechanical equipment and screening shall be installed as follows:

     1.      Located back of the front setback line;

     2.      Vents located not less than five feet from any screening wall; and

     3.      Location and Design Requirements. Solid waste and recyclable materials storage areas shall be located and constructed in the following manner:

     a.      Solid waste and recyclable material storage shall be adjacent or combined with one another. They may only be located inside a specially-designated structure, designed and constructed to provide adequate screening and area for the receptacles. The enclosures shall have solid block walls six feet in height on three sides and an opaque solid metal gate(s) at least six feet in height on the fourth side. Both sides of the gate(s) and walls shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding structures. The gate(s) shall be maintained in working order and shall remain closed when not in use. Solid waste receptacles for single-family residences shall be kept within the enclosed garage or other enclosed indoor or outdoor space that is suitably screened from public view;

     Exceptions to the enclosure dimensional and design requirements may be made from time to time by the director in response to site or other existing or proposed design constraints, amount of solid waste and/or recyclable materials generated, and changes in technology or methods. In all cases, however, suitable provisions shall be made and maintained to sufficiently accommodate the solid waste and/or recyclable materials generated;

     b.      Enclosures shall have a pedestrian entrance separate from the main enclosure gate(s) to enable convenient access to the receptacles without having to open and close the gate(s). The pedestrian entrance shall be designed to not reduce the screening effect of the enclosure and shall be connected to a paved surface or pathway by a sidewalk;

     c.      Enclosures shall be conveniently located in relation to adjacent uses and structures to promote the proper disposal of solid waste and recyclable materials. An enclosure may be shared by more than one use; provided, the enclosure is accessible, convenient, and adequate for all users;

     d.      Enclosures shall be located within curbed areas and, except at access points, surrounded by a minimum three-foot wide planter landscaped with groundcover and shrubs capable of vertically screening the enclosures;

     e.      Enclosures shall not be allowed in street parkways, nor located in a manner which is insensitive to adjacent uses because of potential noise, odor, and other undesirable impacts. Whenever possible, enclosures shall be located away from public and private streets, project entrances, and the front of a structure so as to be inconspicuous from public view;

     f.       Whenever feasible, existing development required to provide an area for recyclable materials shall utilize existing solid waste enclosures if in compliance with this section. For existing development, the director may approve the use of one parking space, a landscape area, or open space in order to meet the enclosure and receptacle requirement for recyclable materials when provided in compliance with this section and when determined by the director that the loss of a parking space, landscaping area, or open space area does not negatively effect the public health, safety, and welfare;

     g.      Driveways or travel aisles shall provide unobstructed access, maneuvering room, and height clearance for vehicles accessing the enclosures;

     h.      Enclosures shall be maintained free of litter, insects, rodents, and other undesirable aspects or elements. Solid waste and recyclable materials shall not be allowed to accumulate around or within or above the walls of the enclosures in order to avoid creating a visual, public health, or safety nuisance;

Chapter 17.22 AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES/DENSITY BONUS PROVISIONS
17.22.010 Purpose.
     This chapter provides for the preservation and maintenance of the city’s affordable housing supply, as well as incentives for the development of housing that is affordable to the types of households and qualifying residents identified in Section 17.22.020 (Eligibility for bonus and incentives). In offering these incentives, this chapter is intended to implement the requirements of state law (Government Code Sections 65302, 65913, and 65915, et seq.) and the goals and policies of the city’s housing element. (Ord. 905 § 1, 2005; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.22.020 Eligibility for bonus and incentives.
     In order to be eligible for a density bonus and other incentives as provided by this chapter, a proposed residential development project shall:

     A.     Consist of five or more dwelling units; and

     B.      Provide for the construction of one or more of the following within the development:

     1.      Ten percent of the total units of a housing development for lower income households, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50079.5; or

     2.      Five percent of the total units of a housing development for very low income households, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50105; or

     3.      A senior citizen housing development as defined in Civil Code Sections 51.3 and 51.12; or

     4.      Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a condominium project or in a planned development as defined in Civil Code Section 1351(f) and (k), respectively, for persons and families of moderate income, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50093. (Ord. 905 § 1, 2005; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.22.030 Types of bonuses and incentives allowed.
     A residential development project that satisfies all relevant provisions of this chapter shall be entitled to a density bonus and one or more incentives described below. If the density bonus or incentives cannot be accommodated on a parcel due to strict compliance with the provisions of this title, the council shall waive or modify development standards to accommodate the bonus units or incentives to which the development would be entitled, unless such waiver or modification would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.

     A.     Minimum Density Bonus. The density bonus granted to a residential development project shall consist of an increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and land use element of the general plan as of the date of application. Such increase shall be equal to at least:

     1.      A twenty percent increase in density, when the development meets the requirements of Section 17.22.020(B)(1), (2) or (3); or

     2.      A five percent increase in density, when the development meets the requirements of Section 17.22.020(B)(4).

     3.      A fifteen percent increase in density, when an applicant for a residential development donates land to the city in accordance with the requirements of Government Code Section 65915(h)(1) through (6). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the authority of the city to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development.

     4.      The city may, at its discretion, grant a density bonus that is greater than that described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) for a development that meets the requirements therein or proportionately lower than that described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) for a development that does not meet the requirements therein.

     B.      Additional Density Bonus.

     1.      The amount of density bonus to which the applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the base percentage established in Section 17.22.020(B). The amount of density bonus for a donation of land shall vary according to the amount by which the donation exceeds the base donation established by Government Code Section 65915(h)(2).

     a.      Lower income households. For each one percent increase above ten percent in the percentage of units affordable to lower income households, the density bonus shall be increased by one and one half percent.

 

     b.      Very low income households. For each one percent increase above five percent in the percentage of units affordable to very low income households, the density bonus shall be increased by two and one half percent.

     c.      Moderate income households. For each one percent increase above ten percent in the percentage of units affordable to moderate income households, the density bonus shall increase by one percent.

     d.      Donation of land. For each one percent increase above the minimum ten percent land donation, the density bonus shall be increased by one percent. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the authority of the city to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development.

     2.      The base density bonus shall not be included when determining the number of housing units that is greater than five percent or ten percent of the total development. All calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. In no event shall the city be required to grant more than a thirty five percent increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning ordinance and land use element of the general plan.

     c.      Three incentives for a project that includes at least fifteen percent of the total units for very low income households.

     3.      Moderate income households. An applicant shall receive:

     a.      One incentive for a project that includes at least ten percent of the total units for persons and families of moderate income in a condominium or planned development;

     b.      Two incentives for a project that includes at least twenty percent of the total units for persons and families of moderate income in a condominium or planned development; and

     c.      Three incentives for a project that includes at least thirty percent of the total units for persons and families of moderate income in a condominium or planned development.

     D.     Incentives, Description. A project that is eligible to receive incentives pursuant to subsection (C) above shall be entitled to at least one of the following incentives identified in Government Code Section 65915(1):

     1.      A reduction in the parcel development standards (e.g., coverage, setback, zero lot line and/or reduced parcel sizes).

     2.      Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if nonresidential land uses would reduce the cost of the housing project, and the nonresidential land uses would be compatible with the housing project and adjoining development.

     3.      Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the city that would result in identifiable cost reductions.

     4.      A reduction in the number of required parking spaces, upon request by the applicant. For a one bedroom unit, one parking space is required; for two and three bedroom units, two parking spaces are required and for four or more bedroom units, two and one-half parking spaces are required.

     E.      Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the city to provide, or limit the city’s ability to provide, direct financial incentives for housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land by the city or the waiver of fees and dedication requirements.

     F.      Limitations and Exceptions.

     1.      In order to receive incentives as described in subsections (C) and (D), an applicant must submit a proposal to the city requesting the specific incentives that the applicant desires.

     2.      The city shall grant the incentives requested by the developer pursuant to subsection (E)(1) and required pursuant to subsection (C), unless the city makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following:

     a.      The incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5; or

     b.      The incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households.

     3.      The city’s granting of an incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval.

     4.      Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the city to waive or reduce development standards or to grant an incentive that would have a specific, adverse impact upon health, safety or the physical environment for which there is no feasible method to mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact; nor shall this subsection require the city to waive or reduce development standards or to grant an incentive that would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources. (Ord. 905 § 1, 2005; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.22.040 Continued affordability; equity sharing.
     A.     Before the issuance of a building permit for any dwelling unit in a development for which “density bonus units” have been awarded or incentives have been received, the developer shall identify the restricted units and shall enter into a written covenant with the city to guarantee one or both of the following, as applicable:

     1.      Lower and very low income households; continued affordability. The continued affordability and availability of the lower and very low income units shall be for a minimum of thirty years, as required by state law (Government Code Sections 65915(c)(1) and 65916). Those units targeted for lower income households, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50079.5, shall be affordable at a rent that does not exceed thirty percent of sixty percent of the area median income. Those units targeted for very low income households, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50105, shall be affordable at a rent that does not exceed thirty percent of fifty percent of the area median income.

     2.      Moderate income households; equity sharing. The initial occupant of any moderate income unit in a condominium or planned development shall be a person or family of moderate income, as required by state law (Government Code Section 65915(c)(2)). Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall recapture its proportionate share of appreciation, which shall be equal to the percentage by which the initial sale price to the moderate income person or family was less than the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale. The city shall spend recaptured funds within three years for any purposes to promote home ownership, as described in Health and Safety Code Section 33334.2(e).

     B.      Recordation of Agreement. The terms and conditions of the covenant shall run with the land which is to be developed, shall be binding upon the successor(s)-in-interest of the developer, and shall be recorded in the county recorder’s office. In addition to the requirements described in subsection (A) above, the agreement shall include the following provisions:

     1.      The developer shall give the city a continuing right- of-first-refusal to purchase or lease any or all of the designated units at the fair market value;

     2.      The deeds to the designated units shall contain a covenant stating that the developer shall not sell, rent, lease, sublet, assign, or otherwise transfer any interests for same without the written approval of the city confirming that the sales or rental price of the units is consistent with the limits established for lower, very low and moderate-income households, which shall be related to the Consumer Price Index; and

     3.      The city shall have the authority to enter into other agreements with the developer or purchasers of the dwelling units, as may be necessary to ensure that the lower and very low income units are continuously occupied by eligible households. (Ord. 905 §1, 2005; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.22.050 Location of affordable units.
     A.     Location/Dispersal of Units. The location of affordable units within the qualifying project shall be at the discretion of the city with the goal to integrate the units into the overall project. However, the inclusionary units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the development where feasible, shall contain on average the same number of bedrooms as the noninclusionary units, and shall be compatible with the design or use of the remaining units in terms of appearance, materials, and finish quality.

     B.      Alternative Development Site. Circumstances may arise in which the public interest would be served by allowing some or all of the affordable units associated with one housing development to be produced and operated at an alternative development site. Where the owner/developer and the city form an agreement, the resulting linked developments shall be considered a single housing development for purposes of this chapter. Under these circumstances, the owner/developer shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter for the affordable units to be provided on the alternative site. (Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.22.060 Child care facilities.
     A.     When an applicant proposes to construct an eligible residential development project as defined in Section 17.22.020, and includes a child care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to, the project, the city shall grant either of the following:

     1.      An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of square feet in the child care facility.

     2.      An additional incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.

     B.      The city shall require, as a condition of approving the housing development, that the following occur:

     1.      The child care facility shall remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the density bonus units are required to remain affordable pursuant to Section 17.22.040.

     2.      Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low, lower and moderate income households shall equal a percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are required for very low, lower or moderate income households pursuant to subsection 17.22.020(B).

     C.      Notwithstanding subsections (A) and (B) above, the city shall not be required to provide a density bonus or incentive for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities. (Ord. 905 §1, 2005)

 

17.22.070 Processing of bonus request.
     A.     Permit Required. Requests for affordable units shall require approval of a development plan permit in compliance with Chapter 17.42 which shall be reviewed and recommended by the commission, and approved by the council.

     B.      Initial Review of Bonus Request. The director shall notify the developer within ninety days of the filing of the development plan permit application whether the development project qualifies for the additional density.

     C.      Criteria to Be Considered. Criteria to be considered in analyzing a requested density bonus shall include whether the applicant has agreed to construct a development that meets the requirements of Section 17.22.020. Criteria to be considered in analyzing a requested incentive shall include whether an incentive has a specific adverse impact upon health, safety or the physical environment, and whether there is no feasible method to eliminate or mitigate such specific adverse impact.

     D.     Findings for Approval. In addition to the findings required for the approval of a development plan permit in compliance with Chapter 17.42, the approval of a density bonus shall require the following additional findings to be made in a positive manner:

     1.      The development project would not be a hazard or nuisance to the city at large or establish a use or development inconsistent with the goals and policies of the general plan;

     2.      The number of dwellings can be accommodated by existing and planned infrastructure capacities;

     3.      Adequate evidence exists to ensure that the development of the property would result in the provision of affordable housing in a manner consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter;

     4.      In the event that the city does not grant at least one financial concession or incentive as defined in state law (Government Code Section 65915) in addition to the density bonus, that additional concessions or incentives are not necessary to ensure affordable housing costs; and

     5.      There are sufficient provisions to guarantee that the lower and very low income units would remain affordable in the future.

     E.      Development Standards. In no case may the city apply any development standard that would have the effect of precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of 17.22.020(B) at the densities or with the incentives permitted by this chapter. An applicant may submit to the city a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards. The applicant must show that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the affordable housing units economically feasible. (Ord. 905 §1, 2005; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.22.080 Appeals.
     An applicant may initiate judicial proceedings if the city refuses to grant a requested density bonus, incentive, or modification or waiver of a development standard. If a court finds that the refusal to grant a requested density bonus, incentive, or modification or waiver of a development standard is in violation of this chapter or Government Code Section 65915, the court shall award the plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit. (Ord. 905 §1, 2005)

     B.      For all development projects, except for individually approved single-family dwellings, landscape design plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect licensed in the state of California.

     C.      Landscaping design plans shall be in harmony with the surrounding desert environment and emphasize the use of drought tolerant plant materials, including desert plants, and as an accent feature varying textures of inorganic groundcover. (Ord. 1064 § 2, 2013; Ord. 990 § 2, 2010; Ord. 777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.24.040 Landscape development standards.
     The following standards shall apply to all landscaping in the city of Rancho Mirage:

     A.     All setbacks, parkways and storage areas that are visible from a public street or from a parking lot available to the public shall be landscaped;

     B.      Trees shall be planted throughout the project in areas of public view, predominantly adjacent to and along structures and street frontages at a rate of at least one tree for each thirty linear feet of street frontage;

     C.      Landscape areas shall be a minimum of four feet wide (excluding curbs). Narrower landscape areas may be allowed, but shall not be counted toward meeting minimum coverage requirements;

     D.     Trees and shrubs shall be planted so that at maturity they do not interfere with utility service lines, street lighting, street sweeping, traffic safety sight areas, on-site signs, and basic property rights of adjoining property owners;

     E.      Prior to final inspection for any given residential dwelling unit within any approved subdivision or development plan permit, a landscape design plan for the rear yard shall be submitted to the development services department if the subject dwelling unit’s rear lot line abuts a lot that contains an existing residential dwelling unit. Starting six inches above the rear yard wall, and extending in a “plane” to the ridge of the residential dwelling unit therein (or if no ridge, then the parapet), all plant material in the required rear yard setback shall not exceed the height of said “plane” at the time of planting through maturity.

     1.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, palm trees may be permitted in the required rear yard setback upon the written consent of the abutting property owners being provided to the city concurrent with the submittal of the landscape design plan.

     2.      Abutting property shall mean the property or properties adjacent to the required rear yard setback of the subject residential dwelling unit and property or properties adjacent to a side property line along the required rear yard setback of the subject residential dwelling unit.

17.26.050 Adjustments to off-street parking requirements.
     This section is intended to allow a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces to encourage enhancements which can improve the design and appearance of a development. In addition, the area gained from a reduction may also be used for additional structure square footage; provided, all other criteria are met.

     A.     Shared Parking Reduction. In mixed use development projects, the number of required off street parking spaces may be calculated by using the following shared parking methodology:

 

     Step 1. Calculate the number of required parking spaces for each independent land use category within the mixed use development employing those parking standards in Section 17.26.040;

 

     Step 2. For each different land use category, the number of required spaces calculated in Step 1 above shall be multiplied by each hourly percentage of peak hour parking demand identified in Table 3-7 to determine the number of spaces for each hour;

 

     Step 3. For each hour of the day, the number of spaces calculated for each use shall be totaled across to determine the number of required spaces for all uses within the mixed use development on a hourly basis; and

 

     Step 4. The largest figure in the total column represents the number of off-street parking spaces required within the mixed use development project.

     B.      Rideshare Programs. Upon director review and approval of an employers trip reduction plan approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, an employer may be eligible for a reduction in the amount of off-street parking spaces required for their project. The director shall determine the extent of the parking space reduction.

     C.      Additional Standards.

     1.      In order to benefit from a reduction in the number of required parking spaces, all other parking lot design and landscaping standards in this chapter shall be met or exceeded.

     2.      Developments which utilize shared parking benefits shall provide pedestrian spaces, enhanced landscaping, cart corrals, recycling enclosures, or other amenities required and approved by the director.

     3.      For those developments that benefit from the shared parking concept, up to fifty percent of the area gained by the reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces may be used for the purposes of adding additional structure area and associated parking spaces. In no event shall the total structure area exceed the maximum percentage of parcel coverage for the zoning district in which the development is located.

     D.     Multiple Use Trip Generation. In addition to the shared parking reduction identified in subsection A, above, a commercial or mixed use project may further reduce off-street parking requirements by up to twenty percent on a case-by-case basis if it can be adequately demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the director, that enough multiple use trips will occur to justify the reduction.

17.28.100 Sign program.
     A.     Sign Program Required. In order to ensure that all signs for individual structures or groups of structures are in harmony with other on-site signs, structures, and surrounding developments, a sign program shall be submitted to the department for approval by the applicable review authority identified in subsection F. For signs requiring a sign program, no permit shall be issued for an individual sign before approval by the review authority, in compliance with this chapter. The sign program is not intended to substitute dimensional requirements for those contained in Table 3-13 of Section 17.28.150 (Signs Allowed by Type of Development and Zoning District), except in the case of sign programs approved for commercial projects that qualify as large-scale planned commercial projects pursuant to subsection K.

 

     B.      Application Requirements. A sign program application shall consist of the following:

     1.      A copy of an approved development plan permit or conditional use permit or if an approved development plan permit or conditional use permit does not exist, a site plan showing the location of structures, parking areas, driveways, landscaped areas, and adjacent streets;

     2.      An accurate indication on the development plan or site plan of the location of each existing and proposed sign of any type whether requiring a permit or not;

     3.      Computation of the total number of signs, sign area for individual signs, total sign area, and height of signs for each existing and proposed sign type;

     4.      For each sign existing or proposed in the sign program, the following shall be specified:

     a.      The location of each sign on the structure(s) and property,

     b.      Sign dimensions,

     c.      Color scheme,

     d.      Lettering or graphic style,

     e.      Lighting, if any,

     f.       Materials, and

     g.      Landscape quantities, types, sizes, and planter area dimensions if signs are to be located within planter areas;

     5.      A materials board or sign sample that is an accurate representation of proposed colors, style, and sign material; and

     6.      Any supplemental information deemed necessary by the director.

     C.      Common Sign Program. If the owner(s) of two or more contiguous parcels (disregarding intervening streets and alleys) file with the director a common sign program conforming with all other provisions of this section, the director shall allow a ten percent increase in the maximum total sign area for the combined parcel area.

     D.     Other Provisions. The sign program may contain additional restrictions as the owner(s) of property within the sign program area may reasonably request to be approved by the review authority.

     E.      Consent. The sign program shall be signed by all property owners or their authorized representatives.

     F.      Procedures. A sign program shall be submitted to the director in compliance with a development plan permit approval and before approval of any sign permit.

     1.      All complete sign program applications for total signs greater than twenty square feet shall be referred to the commission for appropriate action based on the sign program’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

     2.      Sign programs for one or more signs totaling twenty square feet or less may be approved by the director.

     G.     Existing Signs Not Conforming to Sign Program. If any new or amended sign program is submitted for a property on which existing signs are located, all existing signs not conforming to the proposed sign program shall be removed or made to conform with the sign program before the issuance of any sign permit within the program area.

     H.     Binding Effect. After approval of a sign program, no sign shall be altered, constructed, displayed, erected, installed, placed, or maintained except in compliance with the approved sign program. The sign program may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this chapter. In case of any conflict between the provisions of a sign program and any other provision of this title, this title shall prevail.

     I.       Approval of Sign Programs. A sign program shall be approved in compliance Section 17.28.040 (Sign permit review).

     J.       Revisions to Sign Programs.

     1.      Revision(s) to a sign program may be approved by the director if it is determined that the revision(s) is minor in nature and that the intent of the original approval, including any condition of the approved sign program, are not affected.

     2.      For any revision(s) which is determined to be significant by the director a new sign permit application shall be submitted to the department and approved by the applicable review authority.

     1.      The exceptions provided in this subsection are applicable to comprehensively planned commercial projects greater than fifteen acres in size that feature superior architecture and landscaping, as determined by the city. Qualifying projects under this subsection are referred to herein as “large-scale planned commercial projects.”

     2.      On-site signage for large-scale planned commercial projects may exceed the limits described in Table 3-13 of Section 17.28.150 (Signs Allowed by Type of Development and Zoning District). The quality of the signage shall be superior in design and construction quality, and appropriate in context and scale for the proposed application, as determined by the city.

     3.      Sign programs for large-scale planned commercial projects shall include a detailed written analysis for all signs that are proposed to exceed the requirements listed in Table 3-13 of Section 17.28.150 (Signs Allowed by Type of Development and Zoning District). (Ord. 1088 § 2, 2014; Ord. 777 § 1, 2002)

 

17.28.110 General provisions for all signs.
     A.     Construction and Maintenance of Signs. All signs shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with the following standards:

     1.      Applicable provisions of the Uniform Building Code and all other applicable construction codes of the city;

     2.      Except for allowed banners, flags, and window signs in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, all signs shall be constructed of rigid and permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, or structure by direct attachment to a rigid frame, structure, or wall; and

     3.      All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition and appearance in compliance with any applicable conditions of approval, all applicable building and electrical codes, and this chapter.

     B.      Measurement of Sign Area.

     1.      Maximum Sign Area.

     a.      Monument, Pole, and Suspended Signs. The maximum sign area for monument, pole, and suspended signs shall be computed as the area of the surface(s) upon which the sign message is placed, but not including any supporting foundation or framework.

 



 

     b.      Wall, Fascia, Awning, and Window Signs. The maximum sign area for an individual wall, fascia, awning, or window sign shall be computed by means of the smallest square, rectangle, triangle, circle, or combination thereof, that would encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the message or display or otherwise used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting bracing or framework.

 



 

     c.      Two sided or Multi-Faced Signs. The maximum sign area for a two sided or multi-faced sign shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces, as described above, visible from any one point while standing on the ground. When two sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the sane time, and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of only one of the faces.

     2.      Maximum Height.

     a.      Monument and Pole Signs. The maximum height for freestanding monument or pole signs shall be measured as the distance from the base of the sign support at average finished grade to the top of the highest component of the sign.

     b.      Wall, Fascia, Awning, Suspended and Window Signs. The maximum height of wall, fascia, awning, suspended, and window signs is specified in terms of distance above finished grade to the top of any letter, logo, or other display; or the greatest vertical dimension of letters, logo, or other display; or a combination of both of the above.

     c.      Multiple Lines of Lettering. Where multiple lines of lettering are used, the maximum height of sign lettering is measured by the combined vertical dimension of letters from the top of the highest letter in the top line to the bottom of the lowest letter in the bottom line.

     3.      Maximum Length. The maximum length of awning or suspended signs shall be measured along the line of writing, logo, or other display. (Ord. 777 § 1, 2002)

 

17.28.120 Address signs required.
     A.     Address signs shall be required as condition of approval for a sign permit, sign program, or development plan permit or conditional use permit for the same addressed property.

     B.      The required address sign shall be illuminated and consist of numbers at least six inches, but not more than eight inches, in height.

     C.      The area of the required address sign shall not be included in the calculation of allowable sign area for other signs on the property.

     D.     The location, color, style, lighting, and materials of address signs shall be reviewed by the director for their effect on the provision of emergency services, traffic safety, and for their consistency with any applicable sign program. (Ord. 777 § 1, 2002)

 

17.28.130 Design standards.
     A.     Relationship to Structures. All signs shall be compatible with the predominant visual elements of the on-site structure(s), including construction materials, color, or other design features. Signs in commercial centers, offices, and other similar facilities shall be part of a sign program in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and shall provide a compatible visual design common in theme to all applicable uses and structures.

     B.      Relationship to Other Signs. Where there is more than one sign, all signs shall be complementary to each other in the following manner:

     l.       Type of construction materials (cabinet, sign copy, supports, etc.);

     2.      Letter size, color, and style of copy;

     3.      Method used for supporting sign (wall or ground base);

     4.      Shape of signs and related components; and

     5.      Method of illumination.

     C.      Landscaping. Each monument sign shall be located within a planted landscaped area which is of a shape and design that would provide a compatible setting and ground definition to the sign, incorporating a ratio of landscape area to total sign area of four square feet of landscaped area for each square foot of sign area.

     D.     Relationship to Streets. All signs shall be designed to provide an unobstructed clear view of the public right-of-way to any pedestrian, bicyclist, or motor vehicle driver. As additional safety and design measures along public streets, only one monument sign shall be allowed for each driveway entrance.

     E.      Illuminated Signs. Internally illuminated signs are prohibited on residential parcels and in the interior of residential subdivisions. The method of sign illumination along the exterior of residential subdivisions and in nonresidential developments shall be reviewed as part of the sign permit or Sign Program process.

     F.      Letter Height for Fascia and Wall.

     1.      The allowable height of letters, numbers, or logos on fascia or wall signs in commercial zoning districts shall be determined by the following factors:

     a.      Distance from the front street to the sign;

     b.      Compatibility with surrounding signs;

     c.      Relationship to the structure wall height or fascia height; and

     d.      Relationship to the length of the sign.

     2.      The maximum letter height and area for fascia and wall signs shall be as follows:

     a.      Signs which are less than two hundred feet from the street right-of-way shall be allowed a maximum of eighteen-inch high letters and forty square feet of area;

     b.      Signs which are more than two hundred feet but less than two hundred eighty feet from the street right-of-way shall be allowed a maximum of twenty-inch high letters and forty-five square feet of area;

     c.      Signs which are more than two hundred eighty feet but less than three hundred sixty feet from the street right-of-way shall be allowed a maximum of twenty-two-inch high letters and fifty square feet of area and;

     d.      Signs which are more than three hundred sixty feet from the street right-of-way shall be allowed a maximum of twenty-four-inch high letters and fifty-five square feet of area. (Ord. 777 § 1, 2002)

 

17.28.140 Use of exposed neon tubing.
     The use of neon (exposed gaseous light tubing) shall be allowed in commercial zoning districts only. Any use of neon requires the approval of a sign permit in compliance with Section 17.28.040. In addition, the following requirements shall apply:

     A.     Neon signs and linear tubing shall be UL (Underwriters Laboratories) listed with a maximum twenty amps for each circuit;

     F.      When used as an architectural element, neon tubing shall be used only to reinforce specific architectural elements of the structure and shall be concealed from view through the use of cornices, ledges, parapets, or similar devices. (Ord. 777 § 1, 2002)

 

17.28.150 Signs allowed by type of development and zoning district.
     Table 3-13 provides a listing of all signs allowed for each type of development and corresponding zoning districts.

     4.      Buildings shall be placed in a manner to allow streetscape building diversity. Clusters of condominiums shall be sited in a manner that respects the natural topography and that avoids excessive massing. Front setbacks of structures shall be varied by increasing some setbacks to the extent necessary to create an interesting appearance from the street.

     5.      Private drives serving the clusters of single-family homes shall be curvilinear, either following the natural contours, or in the event of a flat site, to avoid long straight-aways.

     6.      Condominium structures shall be offset to avoid linear arrangement of homes between clusters and across streets.

     7.      The project shall establish safe, direct and convenient access to common amenity areas.

     8.      Private driveways serving four or less dwelling units having no parking within the travelway shall have a minimum paved width of twenty-four feet.

     D.     Structure Design.

     1.      Building design shall integrate and equitably distribute details on sides of proposed structures which face private streets, common areas and public rights-of-way as follows:

     a.      Light and shadow achieved through openings, projections, recesses and details;

     b.      Avoidance of large blank façades;

     c.      Roof lines shall vary by use of varying roof structural configurations and slopes.

     2.      Rear building elevations shall incorporate design features consistent with front building elevations.

     E.      Landscaping.

     1.      Hierarchy of the circulation system shall be reinforced by landscaping. Project plans shall identify opportunities and techniques for the creation of focal points where appropriate. Such opportunities may include, but shall not be limited to, use of attractive hardscape elements, specimen trees, water features or unusual plant groupings.

     2.      The use of special landscape treatments and/or thematic elements shall be used to embellish distinguishable features of the condominium project.

     3.      The applicant shall enhance entry view corridors. Design treatments which enhance project entries through the use of raised medians, additional landscaping, landscape theme and location of recreational amenities may be required.

     4.      It shall be demonstrated that trees will be distributed on slopes, common areas and/or lots and along private streets so as to interrupt and soften the silhouette of structures visible from outside the project.

     5.      The natural vegetation and topography should be preserved where such natural features contribute to the attractiveness of the project and compatibility within the neighborhood or district.

     F.      Compatibility with Surrounding Development.

     1.      The applicant shall design the project to create project edges which are compatible with adjacent residential communities, which have been previously approved by the city. Similar structure heights, comparable or more attractive perimeter walls, architectural features and landscaping improvements shall be designed.

     2.      The design of the condominium structures and overall site plan should be compatible with the physical characteristics of the site, with buildings adjacent to the site, and with the character of the neighborhood or district. Design compatibility of buildings includes harmonious building style, form, size, color, materials and relationship to site topography. A compatible design plan is one which preserves the existing neighborhood character, facilitates efficient and convenient circulation, is functionally related to the natural topography, utilizes natural characteristics of the site, and is an asset to the community.

     3.      Due consideration should be given to the impact of condominium development on the neighborhood or district in which property is located. Development should be designed to minimize view obstruction. (Ord. 1027 § 2, 2011; Ord. 862 Exh. A, 2004)

All applications shall demonstrate how the proposed wireless communications and ancillary structures shall be designed so that observers will be unable to discern the presence of wireless communications antenna or antenna array on the project site. This objective shall be achieved through one or more of the following techniques:

     a.      Architecture. Enclosed within an integrated architectural element.

     b.      Stealth Design. The facility shall be designed to visually and operationally blend into the surrounding area, in a manner compatible with the local community character. The facility shall use the most quiet cooling equipment and whisper emergency generating apparatus. Artificial trees may be permitted in exceptional circumstances but are generally disfavored. When artificial trees are proposed, all paint, materials and colors shall be listed by manufacturer and color number. When an artificial tree is proposed, the applicant/permittee shall provide sufficient samples, models or other information to demonstrate that alternative designs have been considered and rejected, and the reasons for the rejections. Where artificial trees (monopalms) are proposed, a landscaping and irrigation plan shall be submitted with the application that includes, at a minimum, a cluster of live palm trees aesthetically similar to the proposed monopalm. Live palm trees shall be planted that are in reasonable proportion and height to screen the proposed monopalm. In cases where flag poles are used to conceal telecommunications equipment, the pole shall be located in a pedestrian plaza or formalized/enhanced landscape setting and may not require additional screening. All ground mounted equipment shall be effectively screened with an architectural wall or placed underground.

     c.      Landscape Screening. The applicant/permittee shall provide a landscape plan to screen the facility as part of the CUP submittal. When trees are to be removed, the replacement tree shall be shown on the landscape plan.

     1.      A lighting plan must be included with the CUP application.

     2.      Maintenance. All facilities, landscaping, and related equipment shall be maintained in good working order and free from trash, debris, graffiti and designed to discourage vandalism. Any damaged equipment shall be repaired or replaced within twenty-four hours. Damaged, dead or decaying plant materials shall be removed and replaced within ten days from the date of notification.

     3.      Monitoring. Once the wireless communications facility is operating, the city may, if a legitimate concern regarding the facility arises, require the applicant/permittee to submit documentation that the facility is operating within the technical standards as described in the application and the Federal Communications Commission permit. Independent field strength or power density measurements shall be provided to the director within thirty days of written request to the applicant/permittee.

     Within thirty days before or after the first and second annual anniversary of when the city issues any permit authorized by this chapter, the applicant/permittee shall submit the following information, in writing, to the director:

     a.      Confirmation that the facility continues to operate in compliance with all terms and conditions of approval by the city.

     b.      Independent field strength measurements or power density plot taken within the past thirty days that verify that the facility continues to operate in compliance with all terms and conditions and emissions standards imposed by the Federal Communications Commission.

     c.      Confirmation that the facility continues to function as an essential element of the applicant/permittees network.

     d.      Documentation of any complaints received by the applicant/permittee since the inception of operations regarding the operation and maintenance of the facility, including the applicant/permittees actions to address the complaints.

17.32.080 Construction time, abandonment and decommissioning.
     All wireless communications facilities which receive a permit under this chapter shall be completed and operational within one hundred eighty calendar days of the issuance of the permit and all related permits or licenses. The construction time may be extended for an additional one hundred eighty calendar days upon a showing of good faith efforts to complete the facility, which shall take into account complications beyond the control of applicant/permittee. If the facility is not completed and operational by the end of the extension period, then the permit shall expire, and the applicant/permittee must reapply for the permit; however, this provision shall not apply when the applicant/permittee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that the operational delay is due entirely to factors beyond the control of the applicant/permittee, in which event the director may extend the construction time in his or her discretion.

     Any facility that ceases operating for more than ninety consecutive days shall be considered abandoned. In such an event the applicant/permittee must either: (A) apply for all permits required at the time of expiration to reactivate the operation; or (B) remove all elements of the facility and restore the site. In the event the applicant/permittee fails to apply for permits or perform the removal and restoration within these ninety days, the property owner shall have the facility removed. (Ord. 778 § 1 (Exh. A), 2002)

 

17.32.090 Height limits.

The grantee of this franchise shall file with the clerk of the city within three months after the expiration of the calendar year, or fractional calendar year, following the date of the grant of this franchise, and within three months after the expiration of each and every calendar year thereafter, a duly verified statement showing in detail the total gross receipts of the grantee, its successors or assigns, during the preceding calendar year, or such fractional calendar year, from the sale of the utility service within the city for which this franchise is granted. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay to the city within fifteen days after the time for filing such statement, in lawful money of the United States, the specified percentage of its gross receipts for the calendar year, or such fractional calendar year, covered by such statement. Any neglect, omission or refusal by the grantee to file such verified statement, or to pay the percentage, at the times or in the manner hereinbefore provided, shall be grounds for the declaration of a forfeiture of this franchise and of all rights thereunder.
