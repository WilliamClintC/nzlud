All contracts entered into by the City of Winslow for construction of public works projects, all contracts entered into by the City of Winslow for the furnishing of manufactured materials to the City, all contracts for the purchase by the City of materials supplied by a Winslow dealer and all contracts for other products purchased by the City shall include a provision granting to qualified contractors, to qualified furnishers or producers of materials, to qualified dealers of materials and to qualified merchants a five (5) percent preference over other unqualified bidders.

The bid of a qualified contractor and the bid of a qualified producer or manufacturer of materials and the bid of a qualified supplier or dealer of materials or other products or of a qualified merchant (hereinafter "qualified bidder") shall be deemed a better bid than a competing bid of a non-qualified bidder if the competing bid is less than five percent lower than the bid of the qualified bidder, but only if the qualified bidder is willing to reduce its bid to match the otherwise lowest bid.

C.    Qualified Contractor. A person or business entity is a "qualified contractor" within the meaning of this section if all of the following are true:

1.    The person or entity is a licensed contractor in the State of Arizona;

2.    The business address of the person or business entity is and has been for at least eighteen (18) consecutive months immediately prior to the tender of the bid in question located within the City of Winslow;

3.    The person or business entity has paid transaction privilege taxes in the City of Winslow for at least eighteen (18) consecutive months immediately prior to the tender of the bid in question;

4.    The person or business entity owns or leases real property or personal property located within the Winslow City limits, and has paid all real or personal property taxes assessed to such property for at least eighteen (18) months immediately prior to the tender of the bid in question, or leases such property from a person or entity which did pay such taxes for the period set out herein;

5.    The person or business entity owns or leases vehicles or equipment under the same name and address as disclosed in subsections (C)(1) through (4) of this section; and

6.    The person or business entity agrees to employ at least fifty (50) percent of its workers from those who have resided within the City limits of the City of Winslow for at least six (6) months prior to the tender of the bid in question.

7.    In lieu of not more than two (2) of the requirements listed in subsections (C)(2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section, other facts exist that justify the City, in its sole and final discretion, in concluding that the person or entity is a "qualified contractor."

D.    Qualified Furnishers or Manufacturers of Materials or Qualified Dealers of Materials. A person or business entity is a "qualified furnisher or producer of materials" or a "qualified dealer of materials" within the meaning of this section if all of the requirements of subsections (C)(2) through (7) of this section are met, and the person or business entity is in the business of furnishing or producing materials or as a dealer of materials to the public.

F.    A qualified bid shall provide that the work to be performed by a contractor or the materials to be produced or furnished or provided by a dealer or merchant to the City shall be performed or furnished or provided by the person or entity tendering the bid. Such person or entity shall not assign, delegate or sublet the contract to another person or entity which is not qualified as defined herein without approval by the City.

G.    The City Manager, in his discretion, may determine whether the dollar amount of the contract is sufficiently high to justify the additional administrative cost which will result from the application of this section.

H.    Since bottom line cost is only one (1) factor in determining the successful bidder, the City Manager is directed to implement the preference created heretofore as one (1) of the factors to be considered when evaluating and awarding a bid.

I.    No qualified bid may claim more than one (1) preference under this section per bid.

J.    The formation of a joint venture, partnership or other business entity shall not be used to avoid the criteria set out heretofore in order to constitute a qualified contractor, qualified furnisher, dealer or merchant.

K.    This section is not intended to conflict with any State or federal statutes or laws. The City staff is directed to implement and uniformly enforce this section in a manner consistent with all State and federal laws. If State or federal revenues are being used in whole or in part to fund a contract within this section, the City Manager shall determine whether such entity allows the application of the section. This section shall not be applicable to a given transaction/contract if and to the extent that the govemmental entity which is providing all or part of the funds for the transaction/contract does not permit the application of a local bid preference.

L.    The burden is on the person or business entity seeking to submit a qualified bid to ask the City to be considered as a qualified bidder as defined heretofore and to provide certification or evidence of such qualifications to the City at the time the bid is tendered.

M.    Severability. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines a provision of this chapter is invalid or void, the remainder of the chapter shall be implemented to the extent possible in order to achieve the purpose of the City in the adoption of this section.

The City Council is desirous of providing all City services to members of the public who may benefit therefrom. In order to adequately provide City services to all members of the public, the City Manager shall take such steps as he deems appropriate to identify City employees who are fluent in the languages likely to assist City staff in providing City services to the public, and make arrangements with those staff members and their supervisors to make said staff members available on short notice to provide translation services for languages which the City Manager believes are likely to require translators in order to adequately provide City services to the public, and to develop such other administrative guidelines as the City Manager may deem necessary to fulfill the purpose of this section, including but not limited to having interpreters available at City Council meetings and meetings of City boards and commissions upon request.

3.08.020 Policy Against Harassment

A.    The City believes that its employees should be able to work in an atmosphere free from all forms of harassment. Therefore, it is the City’s policy to prohibit all types of harassment, including harassment based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability or veterans status. This policy extends to each and every level of our operations. Accordingly, harassment, whether by a fellow employee, a customer, a guest, or a member of management will not be tolerated.

B.    Definition. Harassment is unwanted and unsolicited verbal or physical conduct relating to an individual’s sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status when this conduct: (1) has the effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment; (2) has the effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance; or (3) otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities. Some examples of conduct that may constitute prohibited harassment include: slurs, jokes, cartoons, stereotypes, statements, etc., based upon sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status.

C.    Policy Against Sexual Harassment.

1.    It is illegal and against the City’s policy for any employee, male or female, to harass another employee by making unwelcome sexual advances; requesting or offering sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when (a) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment, (b) an individual’s submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision affecting the individual, or (c) the effect of such conduct is to substantially interfere with the affected individual’s work performance or to create an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

2.    Some examples of behavior that may be construed as sexual harassment include such actions as unwelcome sexual advances, propositions, sexually suggestive gestures, sexual jokes, touching, physical assault, sexually explicit or suggestive objects or pictures, references to a person’s body parts, requests for sexual activity, and/or sexually explicit conversation. However, conduct or actions that arise out of a personal or social relationship and that are not unwelcome or intended to have a discriminatory employment effect may not be viewed as harassment. The City will determine whether such conduct constitutes sexual harassment based on a review of the facts and circumstances of each situation.

3.    The City will not tolerate any sexual harassment of its employees. All employees, including supervisors and managers, will be subject to severe discipline, up to and including termination, for committing any act of sexual harassment.

D.    Complaint Procedure.

1.    An employee who feels victimized by sexual harassment should report the harassment to his/her supervisor immediately. If the worker’s immediate supervisor is the source of or a party to the alleged harassment, the employee should report the problem to the supervisor’s superior or to the Human Resources Director. The Human Resources Director shall promptly notify the City Manager of the general nature of the complaint. A job applicant who believes he or she has been a victim of sexual harassment may file a complaint with the Human Resources Director.

2.    No employee will be subject to any form of retaliation or discipline for pursuing, in good faith, a sexual harassment complaint. Any employee found guilty of retaliation will be disciplined.

E.    Investigation Procedure. Upon receipt of a complaint alleging harassment, the department head or supervisor will promptly notify the Human Resources Director. The department head and the Human Resources Director will promptly and properly investigate the complaint. The Human Resources Director will work with the department to obtain and evaluate all relevant evidence with respect to what has occurred and determine what remedy is appropriate. If there is reasonable cause to believe that sexual harassment occurred, recommendations will be made by the department head for specific remedial and disciplinary actions. The complainant and the party charged will be notified of the findings.

F.    Discipline.

1.    The type of discipline to which an employee will be subject for sexually harassing another employee will depend on the severity of the finding. Discipline may range from verbal counseling to dismissal. If the discipline is a suspension, pay reduction, disciplinary probation, demotion or dismissal, the employee will be advised of his/her right to appeal, if any, the action under these personnel rules and regulations. The City Manager and the Human Resources Director will determine the appropriate discipline on a case-by-case basis. (See Section 3.20.100.)

2.    The City Manager has the authority to reassign any employee to minimize conflict created by a sexual harassment charge. If reasonable cause has been found that sexual harassment has taken place and that a reassignment is the best solution, every effort will be made to transfer the offending employee rather than the complainant unless the complainant chooses to be transferred. If reassignment is not practical, the department head will monitor the situation for evidence of retaliation and/or continued inappropriate behavior.

G.    Confidentiality. All complaints shall be kept as confidential as possible, except to satisfy the provisions of this rule. Employees who are involved with, witness or are aware of investigations are expected to maintain the same level of confidentiality. The use of this complaint procedure will in no way affect employee rights.

H.    Harassment of any kind (e.g., verbal, physical, mental, etc.) will not be tolerated at any time by the City. Any employee who feels that he/she has been harassed in any such manner may follow the above provisions of this policy as outlined in subsections A through F of this section.

1.    Take appropriate personnel action against an employee, up to and including termination; or

1.    Preemployment (no alcohol screening shall be required, except as required by applicable law); or

2.    On a random basis as mandated by federal or State laws or regulations; or

3.    Where reasonable suspicion exists*** that the employee is using or is under the influence of any controlled substance (no alcohol screening shall be required, except as required by applicable law); or 

4.    Where circumstances or workplace conditions justify it.

F.    The City supports the viewpoint that substance abuse is a medical problem which can be treated. Information will be available on a confidential basis from the City’s Human Resources Department on public and private drug counseling, rehabilitation and employee assistance programs upon the request of any employee.

G.    The City shall make every effort to maintain a drug-free workplace through the implementation of this policy. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 1129 (part), 2010; Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 670 § 1(203), 1995)

*Note–Prior to any personnel action being taken, a "positive" test result will lead to an immediate retest of the sample submitted.

**An employee’s refusal to submit to such a test shall result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

***"Reasonable Suspicion" is defined as the belief by an employee’s department head or supervisor that the employee while acting within the scope of his/her employment is in violation of this policy. Reasonable suspicion will relate to the conduct or activity of an employee while that employee is on duty.

3.12.040 Interview Process

The employment interview is a supplement to and part of the selection process.

Questions which pertain to sex, race, religion, age, disability status, marital status or other inquiries of prohibited information will not be allowed, except as provided by law.

E.    Inquiries as to a candidate’s abilities to perform essential job functions with or without a reasonable accommodation are permitted when such inquiries are based on job requirements and are consistent with applicable disabilities laws.

G.    The appointing department will inform the interview panel of the responsibilities and requirements of the position to be staffed. Copies of the applications of final candidates will also be provided to the interview panel prior to the interview, along with proposed interview questions.

All or parts of the reference check may be delegated to the affected department.

B.    No reference check or background investigation will be conducted without first notifying the applicant of the investigation. The applicant’s signature on the application form constitutes a release permitting his/her references to provide the City with relevant information.

C.    Police Department applicants will require a thorough background check and investigation as required by the Arizona Post Academy. These background checks will be conducted by the Police Department.

D.    Results of the reference check and/or background check will help to determine the applicant’s fitness for the position.

3.12.120 Employee Conduct

A.    Professional and Personal Conduct. The integrity and image of an organization is the integrity of the employees who comprise it; not just administration, but all employees. Therefore, it is important to recognize and accept standards of conduct on the job and off the job when one’s behavior reflects upon the City’s image and reputation in the community.

B.    Residency. Emergency service employees, (as designated in writing by the City Manager, Police Chief, Fire Chief or Utility Department/Division Head) must be able to respond from their residences to emergency call-out situations within a ten (10) minute time frame.

C.    Professional Attire at Work. Dress and personal appearance are representative of both personal and organization professionalism. The image of the City in the community is determined, in part, by the professional conduct of its employees. It is therefore imperative that each employee maintain a neat and clean appearance, as well as dress in a manner which projects a professional image to the public, to the extent allowed by his/her job. The City provides most departments with the uniforms necessary for this image. All department heads shall be responsible for the enforcement of this provision.

D.    Professional Conduct at Work. The City encourages a relaxed and friendly atmosphere at work conducive to productivity, teamwork and high morale. However, human dignity and personal safety must not be compromised. Harassing or offensive behavior by employees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination. (See Section 3.20.110.)

E.    Appearance of Work Areas. Work areas are to be kept neat and presentable in the interest of safety and efficiency, presenting a professional appearance at all times for co-workers and visitors alike. No material shall be posted or displayed which detracts from the professional image of the workplace. Employees must refrain from posting material which would reasonably be viewed as derogatory on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, or disability.

F.    Use of City Vehicles and Equipment. Employees operating City vehicles and equipment are required to comply with all applicable State and local traffic laws. If safety belts are inoperable or are not provided, or an employee notes any other safety deficiencies in City vehicles or equipment, the employee should immediately contact his/her supervisor to report the deficiencies. Said vehicles and equipment shall not be used for personal use.

G.    Chain of Command. The City encourages the use of a chain of command in all verbal and written communication among its employees. Employees should always attempt to communicate first with their immediate supervisor, unless an employee has an employment dispute or complaint that he/she feels involves that person. If an employee has such a complaint, he/she may request a meeting with any other supervisor in the chain of command including the City Manager or designee, stating the reasons therefor. The contacted supervisor may render his/her decision either in written or verbal form.

H.    Employee Safety and Reporting of Accidents. It is the responsibility of each City employee to report any observed actual or potential health or safety problem to a supervisor for corrective action as soon as practical upon observing or being made aware of such problem. All employees must comply with their department’s safety procedures and City safety policy.

Each City department may prepare specific safety procedures. These procedures must not be inconsistent with this ordinance/manual or with the City safety policy as deemed necessary by the risk manager/safety officer.

Any incident or accident involving employees or visitors to City facilities must be immediately, verbally reported to a supervisor. All employees are required to submit a written report of any incident to their supervisor, no matter how seemingly minor, by the end of the next working day (unless directed by the supervisor to report sooner). Such incidents might potentially involve, but are not limited to, claims against the City for disability compensation or liability claims.

I.    Gratuities. Any person or employee who seeks appointment or promotion with respect to any City position or appointive office who shall directly or indirectly offer, give, render or pay any money, service or other valuable consideration to any person for or in connection with his/her test, evaluation, appointment, proposed appointment, promotion or proposed promotion shall be disqualified for employment. Any employee who has participated in the above described conduct shall be dismissed from employment with the City.

No person who holds any compensated City position shall accept a fee, gift or other valuable item in the course of performing the duties and responsibilities of his/her position. No exempt employee shall accept such fee, gift or other valuable item given by any person in hope or expectation of receiving a favor or better treatment than accorded other persons.

J.    Political Activity.

1.    City employees are covered by the Federal Hatch Act and the Arizona State "Little" Hatch Act. The policy regarding political activity shall be as follows. City employees shall not:

a.    Use their official authority or influence for the purposes of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or nomination for office; or

b.    Directly or indirectly coerce, attempt to coerce, commend or advise a State or local officer or employee to pay, lend or contribute anything of value to a political party, committee, organization, agency or person for a political purpose; or

c.    Engage in any political activity during scheduled working hours while on duty; or

d.    Be required by any City official or employee as a condition of employment, promotions or otherwise, to participate or not participate in any election campaign for any public office or in any partisan political activity whatsoever; or

e.    Use or cause to be used any City facility, equipment or material for the purpose of any political activity.

2.    Any City employee desiring to run for City, county, State or federal office may do so, as long as the aforementioned employment rules concerning political activity are followed.

3.    Any City employee elected to any City office must resign from City service upon approval of the canvass of the votes. Any employee elected or appointed to any county, State or federal office must resign from City service upon approval of the canvass of the votes for that elected office, or if appointed, prior to official appointment to office. This does not apply to the school board, hospital board or any other office that is without remuneration.

4.    A City employee who violates any provision of this section shall be subject to disciplinary action which may include demotion; suspension, with or without pay; or dismissal. This section is not intended to deny any employee any civil or political liberties as guaranteed by the United States and Arizona Constitutions.

c.    The use of a particular expression or illustration as to duties, qualifications or other attributes shall not be held to exclude others not mentioned, if such others are similar in kind and degree. The appropriate supervisor, as circumstances require, may assign different tasks to a position when such duties are similar in kind and rank with those specified in the class of the position. In essence, the phrase "and to do related work as required" is described in this subsection.

d.    Employees may be required to perform other duties during emergency situations or as the City so instructs, based upon the City’s needs.

2.    It shall be the duty of the Human Resources Director to examine the nature of all positions and to allocate them to existing or newly created classes; to make changes in the classification plan as are made necessary by changes in the duties and responsibilities of existing positions; and to periodically review the entire classification plan and recommend appropriate changes in the allocations or in the classification plan.

3.    When a new position is requested by a department head or the duties of an old position are substantially changed, the department head shall submit a written recommendation to the Human Resources Director including justification for the reclassification, emphasizing changes in position responsibilities or requirements for qualifications (i.e., experience, education, certifications, etc.).

4.    The request will be reviewed by the Human Resources Director. If the request is justified, it will be prepared for review by the City Manager. If the City Manager does not concur with the request, the department head will be provided with an explanation. The City Manager shall make the final decision for all reclassification requests.

5.    The department head shall prepare this request for review for the City Council. No reclassification involving an upgrade of salary, not requested and approved as part of the budget process, will be accepted without City Council approval. If approved, the Human Resources Director will take the necessary steps to effect the reclassification.

6.    A reclassification shall become effective on a personnel action form upon approval by the City Manager.

3.16.040 Compensation

A.    Purpose. It is the policy of the City and the purpose of this plan to establish a compensation system that will allow the City to effectively compete for qualified personnel and to ensure that salaries are consistent and commensurate with the duties performed by each employee. The compensation program is designed to:

1.    Attract, motivate, retain and reward qualified employees;

2.    Provide compensation through a program that is internally consistent and externally competitive;

3.    Establish and administer all practices and policies in full compliance with all statutes (e.g., Equal Employment, Fair Labor Standards Act, etc.);

4.    Ensure all positions shall be governed by the compensation structure;

5.    Be reviewed for internal consistency and external competitiveness on an annual or as necessary basis.

B.    The salary schedule shall be adopted by the City Council and shall apply to all employees. Copies of this schedule are available for viewing in the Human Resources Department.

C.    New Employees. Depending on experience and qualifications, new employees may be offered a starting salary higher than the minimum rate in the appropriate salary range.

1.    Promotions: see related policy, Section 3.20.030.

2.    Demotions: see related policy, Section 3.20.050.

3.    Transfers: see related policy, Section 3.20.040.

D.    Cost-of-Living. Cost-of-living adjustments/salary modifications may be granted by the City Council upon recommendation by the City Manager. If granted, they are generally effective July 1st of the fiscal year.

E.    Pay for "acting" status or out-of-classification duties will be permitted with the approval of the City Manager.

F.    Reevaluation/Reclassification. In the event that the salary of any position is reevaluated/reclassified, and the City Council authorizes that it be implemented, and this results in an increased salary range for the position, the employee shall retain his/her current salary within the range or assume the entry-level step of the new range, whichever is greater.

G.    Pay Rates Exceeding Range Maximum. Any employee whose pay rate exceeds the maximum prescribed for his/her classification as a result of a reallocation of his/her position to a lower classification when there have been no recent, dramatic changes in assigned duties and responsibilities will not be reduced in pay. This does not apply to demotions. The employee will not be eligible for future salary increases until he/she occupies a position for which the salary range maximum is more than the pay rate he/she is currently receiving, unless such increase has approval of the City Council.

H.    Classification Plan. Jobs with similar duties and responsibilities are assigned to the same salary level. The Human Resources Department conducts periodic studies of various jobs when there is an indication the employee is working above or below the established responsibilities for that position. These studies are normally initiated at the request of the department head and are contingent upon the approval of the City Manager.

I.    Review of the Salary Plan. The Human Resources Department shall be responsible for the review and administration of the City’s compensation plan. This will include an analysis of prevailing rates of pay for similar positions in comparable labor markets, organizations, cost-of-living factors, budgetary considerations and other related factors. On the basis of this information, the Human Resources Director shall recommend to the City Council changes to keep the plan current, internally consistent and responsive to market forces. Such changes shall be approved by the City Manager and shall then be submitted in the annual budget to the City Council.

2.    Facilitation of teamwork;

3.    Facilitation of supervisory assistance.

The hours of employment shall be forty (40) hours in five (5) or fewer consecutive days for nonmanagement employees.

Departments shall schedule and maintain standard working hours for employees in order to ensure that each department is adequately staffed to provide for the most beneficial service to the public.

B.    Flex Time. Occasions may arise when service to the citizens can be improved through the adjustment of an employee’s work hours. The department head may approve adjustment in work hours.

Individual requests for adjustment of working hours for personal reasons must be evaluated in light of the effect on the criteria enumerated in subsection A of this section.

An employee is expected to remain at his/her assigned work station until the end of the scheduled shift (excluding breaks and lunch period). No work shall be done before starting time or after quitting time unless approved by the immediate supervisor.

F.    Advance notice of anticipated absence or tardiness is expected; notice of unavoidable absence or tardiness is expected when possible. Failure to do so will be construed as an unexcused absence, and the day missed will not be paid to nonexempt employees. Tardiness must be made up during the pay period in which it occurs. Notification by another employee, friend or relative is not considered proper except in an emergency situation where the employee is physically unable to make the notification.

G.    Daily attendance records will be maintained by each department, including date and time absent and reason for absence. With the exception of absences excused pursuant to an employee’s rights under federal or State law, attendance shall be a consideration in determining promotions, transfers, satisfactory completion of probationary periods and continued employment with the City. Frequent tardiness or other attendance irregularities not excused pursuant to an employee’s rights under federal or State law shall be cause for disciplinary action in accordance with Section 3.20.100.

H.    Hours for part-time and certain employees may vary from the normal office hours noted above due to the nature of their duties and will be determined by the appropriate department head. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 670 § 1(406), 1995)

A.    Purpose: to establish policy guidelines for the recording, utilization and auditing of overtime and compensatory time performed by employees of the City.

B.    All rules associated with overtime will be in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act as amended. Any provisions of this policy that do not meet the standards as outlined in this act may be a grievable circumstance under the grievance procedures as outlined in Section 3.20.120.

C.    Under the provisions of the FLSA, compensatory time may be agreed upon by the employer and the individual employee at the request of the employee before the overtime work is performed, but may not be imposed by the employer in lieu of overtime pay upon any nonexempt employee who has not requested such compensatory time off.

D.    A nonexempt employee who performs authorized work in excess of forty (40) hours in a week shall be compensated for such overtime either at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times his/her regular rate of pay or with compensatory time off at the overtime rate. Those hours actually worked and holiday time off will be used for calculating the forty (40) hours. All other leave types will not count toward the forty (40) hours. Straight overtime will be paid until the employee reaches forty (40) hours in a work period with actual time worked and holidays.

1.    Overtime shall be calculated to the nearest one-quarter (1/4) hour of overtime worked.

2.    All overtime must be authorized in advance by the appropriate department, unless an emergency situation exists.

3.    Upon request of the employee, the City may grant compensatory time off in lieu of overtime at its discretion at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2).

4.    Compensatory time off may be accumulated to a maximum of forty (40) hours to be used, upon mutual agreement, by the end of the fiscal year. Unused accumulated hours which have not been utilized within this time frame will be paid to the employee at the end of the fiscal year. Comp time must be exhausted prior to use of vacation, floating holidays or banked holidays.

F.    A nonexempt 207(K) (i.e., Policy and Fire) employee who performs authorized work in excess of the established work schedule (see Section 3.16.060) shall be compensated for such overtime either at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times his/her regular rate of pay or with compensatory time off at the overtime rate.

This resignation shall be forwarded to the Human Resources Director with a personnel action form and a statement by the department head as to the resigned employee’s service performance and other pertinent information concerning the cause for resignation. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 589, 2001; Ord. 670 § 1(507), 1995)

(Manual, Amended, 08/15/2001)


3.20.080 Employee Separation

A.    Employee termination and out process: to establish procedure for employee termination with the City by service or disability retirement, resignation, discharge, probation period termination or layoff. These procedures are designated to provide the least disruption and inconvenience to the employee and the City.

B.    The Human Resources Department is notified of the employee’s separation date via the personnel action form.

C.    Employees shall receive pay for work performed through the last hour worked and for unused benefits as stipulated by policy and laws governing such payments.

D.    Termination pay shall be reduced by any authorized legal deductions; authorized pension plan; credit union, tax sheltered annuity; and any other amounts specifically agreed upon by the employee and the City.

E.    Before the final paycheck is issued to the employee, the employee’s department shall be required to follow the clearance process outlined on the personnel action form. The terminating department is responsible for ensuring all appropriate items on the form have been addressed. Failure by the terminating department to properly complete the form may result in delay of receipt of the final paycheck.

F.    The official date of termination will be the last full day the employee reports for work.

G.    Benefits continue through the time actually worked by the employee, including any days from accumulated vacation and compensatory time. If such time takes the employee through the fifth of the month, health care, dental and life insurance benefits will continue through the last day of the month.

H.    For those employees who are not retiring, monies accumulated in the employee’s retirement account are refundable if desired. Forms required to request this refund are available in the Human Resource Department.

I.    All claims for unemployment compensation as filed by a terminating employee shall be processed by the Human Resources Department. Requests for information about unemployment compensation should be forwarded to the Human Resources Director immediately to avoid unauthorized charges against the City’s account. 

J.    Final paychecks for involuntarily terminated employees will be paid within seven (7) working days or on the next regular pay day, whichever is sooner.

K.    Final paychecks for employees that voluntarily terminate their employment will be issued on the next regular pay day. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 859, 2001; Ord. 670 § 1(508), 1995)

3.20.090 Problem Solving Procedure

All employment disputes or complaints will be handled in the spirit of openness and fairness. The following procedure shall be followed when an employee desires to express dissatisfaction with some aspect of his/her employment:

A.    An employee who has a problem shall first present his/her complaint verbally to his/her immediate supervisor. Every effort shall be made to resolve all complaints through discussion between the employee and his/her immediate supervisor. The supervisor shall notify his/her department head when a complaint is presented so that his/her advice and/or the appropriate counsel may be obtained.

B.    The complainant’s supervisor is encouraged to answer the employee as quickly as possible and must reply no later than five (5) working days after submission of the complaint.

C.    If, after discussion with the employee’s first two (2) levels of supervision, the employee does not believe the problem has been satisfactorily resolved, he/she may file a formal written grievance with his/her immediate supervisor if the dispute or complaint is grievable under this policy. (See Section 3.20.120.) (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 670 § 1(509), 1995)

(Manual, Amended, 04/26/2002)


3.20.100 Progressive Discipline Policy

A.    Purpose. To establish policies and procedures related to disciplinary action for City employees.

B.    It shall be the policy of the City to administer discipline fairly, responsibly and impartially. In most instances, employees and the City are best served when discipline is administered to correct actions rather than to punish.

C.    The employment of City employees shall be based on appropriate standards of job performance and personal and professional conduct. Failure or refusal to meet these standards shall constitute just cause for disciplinary action including oral or written reprimand, imposition of a probationary period as discipline, suspension, demotion and dismissal.

D.    Ordinarily, disciplinary action is not primarily intended to be punitive, but rather to maintain the efficiency and integrity of City service. The nature and severity of the offense and the employee’s prior record shall be considered.

E.    In any disciplinary action, the pertinent information shall be reviewed by the supervisor with the employee, and include the following:

1.    The cause for discipline;

2.    The specific reasons supporting the cause;

3.    The discipline to be imposed;

4.    The effective date;

5.    The right of the employee to comment or respond, including any rights of appeal.

F.    The degree of discipline administered will depend on the severity of the infraction and shall be in accordance with all applicable federal, State or local labor laws and regulations. Discipline is determined on a case-by-case basis. Nothing about this section should be construed in any way to limit the City’s right to impose whatever form of discipline it deems appropriate in any given situation, regardless of the general goal of the progressive discipline policy.

G.    It is the responsibility of each supervisor and department head to evaluate thoroughly the circumstances and facts as objectively as possible and then apply the most suitable form of discipline.

H.    Procedure. Types of disciplinary action may include:

Step 1: Oral Warning. This type of discipline generally should be applied to infractions of a relatively minor degree or in situations where the employee’s performance needs to be discussed. The oral warning should be given in private. Supervisors should inform the employee that the supervisor is issuing an oral warning, that the employee is being given an opportunity to correct the condition, and if the conditions are not corrected, the person will be subject to a more severe form of disciplinary action. A notation that an oral warning was given should be made in the employee’s personnel file.

Step 2: Written Warning/Reprimand. This notice generally will be issued in the event the employee continues to disregard an oral warning or if the infraction is severe enough to warrant a written reprimand in the employee’s personnel file. Written warning/reprimand notices must be issued within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the violation claimed by the supervisor. The warning/reprimand shall state the nature of the infraction in detail and what corrective action must be taken by the employee to avoid further discipline as outlined in Steps 3, 4 and 5.

A copy of the written warning/reprimand is to be handed to the employee at the time of the discussion of the discipline. The employee shall sign the written warning to acknowledge receipt. A copy, signed by the employee, will be placed in the employee’s personnel file. If the employee refuses to sign the acknowledgement, then the supervisor and one (1) other witness shall note on the reprimand that the employee received a copy thereof and refused to sign it. Refusal to sign in receipt of the written warning is insubordination and subject to original discipline.

Step 3: Suspension. This form of discipline generally is administered as a result of a severe infraction of policies or for repeated violation. For minor infractions, a suspension is often given after the employee has received a written reprimand.

1.    Suspension With Pay. An employee of the City may be suspended with pay and benefits pending investigation of allegations of misconduct, when the nature of the allegation involves the ability of the employee to perform his/her duties or any other grounds for dismissal. Such a suspension is not a disciplinary action and may not be appealed. If the charges are unfounded, the employee will be restored to duty and a letter of exoneration will be placed in the employee’s official personnel file. If the charges are sustained, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with the nature of the offense.

2.    Suspension Without Pay. An employee may be suspended without pay when the offense is sufficient for discharge but circumstances related to an employee’s overall performance would not warrant immediate discharge. Department heads may suspend a nonexempt employee for a maximum of three (3) days. Suspensions without pay of more than three (3) days must have the approval of the City Manager. An exempt employee may not be suspended without pay for periods less than one (1) full work week. Suspension without pay may be appealed.

Step 4: Demotion. Demotion may be used when an employee has been promoted to a position where he/she is unwilling or unable to perform the responsibilities of that position. Demotion is not to be used as a substitute for dismissal when dismissal is warranted. For demotion procedures see Section 3.20.050.

Step 5: Dismissal. Immediate removal of an employee from the job site pending review for dismissal may be warranted in instances involving serious misconduct including but not limited to: insubordination, theft, illegal or destructive acts while on the job or other substantial reasons deemed appropriate as outlined in Section 3.20.110 or as deemed appropriate by the City Manager. An employee may be dismissed after repeated offenses of a less serious nature if the offenses have been documented by the supervisor and have not resulted in appropriate behavioral changes.

Probationary (AT-WILL) employees (except charter officers) may be terminated at any time with or without cause. (See Section 3.20.010, Probationary period.)

I.    Regular employees may be placed on disciplinary probation in addition to any of the disciplinary steps referred to herein.

J.    The original copy of the disciplinary action is to be signed by the employee and placed in the employee’s official personnel file with a copy given to the employee. 

K.    Appeals. All nonmanagement nonprobationary employees may appeal any disciplinary action in accordance with the grievance procedures as outlined in Section 3.20.120. Appeals for dismissal, demotion and suspension may be made through the hearing officer as outlined in Section 3.20.130. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 1129 (part), 2010; Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 670 § 1(510), 1995)

(Manual, Amended, 04/25/2002; Manual, Amended, 05/27/1999)


3.20.110 Dismissal

A.    Dismissal is the permanent removal of an employee from City service. This action is taken when management is thoroughly satisfied that the employee has been given sufficient opportunity to meet performance or behavior standards and has clearly failed to do so. Dismissals may also be imposed if the gravity of the misconduct is very serious without any previous progressive discipline.

B.    Each of the following shall constitute grounds for dismissal of a nonmanagement employee:

1.    That the employee is inefficient in the performance of his/her duties and responsibilities;

2.    That the employee is unsafe to himself/herself or other employees in the performance of his/her duties and responsibilities;

3.    That the employee has been abusive in his/her attitude, language, behavior or conduct toward a fellow employee, a supervisor, the public or that his/her action has resulted in physical harm, injury or justifiable fear of the same to such persons;

4.    That the employee has been insubordinate, willfully disobedient or has failed to obey any lawful direction from an appropriate supervisor;

5.    That the employee has accepted a fee, gift or other valuable consideration which is given and/or received with the hope or expectation of receiving favored treatment or other special considerations in the course of performing his/her duties and responsibilities;

6.    That the employee has been convicted of a Class 1 misdemeanor or a felony while employed by the City;

7.    That the employee has falsified any document, report or statement relating to his/her employment or job performance with the City;

8.    That the employee through willful misconduct or negligence has caused damage to or loss of public property or waste or loss of public supplies; 

9.    That the employee has been inexcusably absent, has failed to receive prior approval, where circumstances permitted, for any paid or unpaid absence, chronic tardiness or has abandoned his/her position;

10.    That the employee has been guilty of discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or age;

11.    That the employee has knowingly failed to properly report an accident involving City property or City liability;

12.    That the employee has violated a department rule or regulation;

13.    That the employee has a protected mental or physical disability that does not permit him/her to perform the essential functions of his/her job if the City is unable to reasonably accommodate the protected physical or mental disability of the employee;

14.    That the employee has engaged in conduct of a type which will bring discredit or embarrassment to the City;

15.    That the employee has committed acts of dishonesty or theft;

16.    That while on duty the employee is under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or under the influence or in possession of illegal drugs or controlled substances (illegal drug as defined by State and federal law) while in performance of his/her duties;

17.    That the employee engages in other conduct that the City determines to be terminable misconduct.

C.    Appropriate grounds for dismissal are not limited to those situations described in subsection B of this section. Dismissal also may be imposed under any other circumstance that meets the requirements of subsection A of this section. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 670 § 1(511), 1995)

(Manual, Amended, 04/25/2002)


3.20.120 Grievance Procedures

A.    For the purpose of this policy, a "grievance" means a complaint by a nonmanagement employee of the City concerning the interpretations and application of these policies governing personnel practices and procedures, department work rules, unsafe or unhealthy working conditions, alleged discrimination or alleged improper treatment.

B.    A qualified or valid grievance is a circumstance, other than dismissal, demotion or suspension without pay in excess of three (3) days, thought by the employee to be unjust, which has gone unresolved and which has been expressed in writing. A grievance, based upon a grievable issue must:

The notice shall advise the employee of the date when such proposed disciplinary action shall be effective. Such proposed disciplinary action shall become effective on the date indicated in the notice, unless the employee requests within seven (7) days of the receipt (verified by return or certified mail receipt) of the notice a hearing before the hearing officer.

(Manual, Amended, 04/26/2002; Manual, Amended, 11/19/1998; 784, Amended, 10/13/1998)


3.24.030 Sick Leave

A.    The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the use of sick leave for personal illness and injuries for City employees.

B.    Eligibility. Sick leave with pay shall be granted to all probationary and regular nonmanagement and management employees within the service. Temporary employees will not accrue sick leave. Sick leave shall not be considered as a right which an employee may use at his/her discretion but shall be allowed only in case of actual personal or dependent (as defined in Section 3.04.110) sickness or injury. In the case of personal sickness where employees are capable of performing light duty, they shall so advise their department head who will make these arrangements, provided such light duty is available. Unnecessary use of sick leave shall be cause for disciplinary action.

C.    Notice. In order to receive compensation while absent on sick leave, the employee must have accrued sick leave hours in his/her sick leave account and shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, division or department head prior to or within one (1) hour after the time set for beginning his/her daily duties. If the immediate supervisor cannot be reached, notice shall be given to the Human Resources Director. The employee may be required to file a physician’s certificate or a personal affidavit with his/her immediate supervisor or department head stating the cause of the absence.

D.    Limits. Regular, full-time employees shall earn sick leave at the rate of one (1) work day (eight (8) hours) for each calendar month of service. Regular, part-time employees shall earn sick leave prorated based on the number of hours worked per week. The maximum accrual for unused sick leave shall be one hundred seventy-five (175) hours. 

E.    Holiday/Sick Leave Overlap. In the event that any paid holiday occurs during a period when an employee is on paid sick leave, the holiday shall not be charged against the employee’s accrued sick leave. The only sick leave hours that shall be charged to any employee’s accrued sick leave shall be those hours that the employee is regularly scheduled to work.

F.    Illness/Injury During Vacation. In the event that an employee becomes sick or has an accident during paid time off for vacation, the time may be charged to accrued sick leave with proper medical documentation.

G.    Sick Leave Buy-Out. Employees who retire or resign in good standing with less than five (5) years of continuous service to the City shall be paid an appreciation bonus equaling twenty-five (25) percent of their accumulated sick leave account and sick leave bank (if applicable). Employees who retire or resign in good standing with five (5) but less than fifteen (15) years of service to the City shall be paid an appreciation bonus equaling fifty (50) percent of their accumulated sick leave account and sick leave bank (if applicable). Employees who retire or resign in good standing with fifteen (15) but less than twenty-five (25) years of service shall be paid an appreciation bonus equaling seventy-five (75) percent of their accumulated sick leave account and sick leave bank (if applicable). Employees who retire or resign in good standing with twenty-five (25) or more years of service shall be paid an appreciation bonus equaling one hundred (100) percent of their accumulated sick leave account and sick leave bank (if applicable). This percent shall be based on the employee’s earned sick leave hours up to the maximum accrual amount of one thousand forty (1,040) hours. The sick leave pay as provided in this section shall not be considered when calculating retirement benefits under the State Retirement System.

H.    Disability Payments. An employee receiving temporary disability payments under the workers’ compensation laws may use accumulated sick leave in order to continue to maintain his/her regular income. City employees receiving full salaries from the City, as well as disability payments under workers’ compensation, must remit to the City any funds received from the Workers Compensation Insurance Company. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure that an employee does not suffer an economic hardship as a result of a work-related injury as well as ensure that the employee will not be making a financial gain as a result of an injury.

(Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 1177 (part), 2012; Ord. 1129 (part), 2010; Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 868; Ord. 859, 2001; Ord. 857, 2001; Ord. 670 § 1(603), 1995)

(Manual, Amended, 04/26/2002; Manual, Amended, 12/19/2001; Manual, Amended, 08/15/2001; Manual, Amended, 06/15/2001)


3.24.040 Family Leave

A.    The purpose of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (hereinafter referred to as Family Leave) is to entitle employees to take up to twelve (12) work weeks of leave during any twelve (12) month period for the birth of a son or daughter, the adoption or foster care placement of a child with the employee to care for a child (son or daughter), parent, or spouse with a serious health condition or for the employee’s own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his/her position.

B.    Eligibility.

1.    All City employees are eligible for Family Leave if they have been employed with the City for:

a.    At least twelve (12) months; and

b.    Have worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours (one hundred fifty-six (156) days) of service with the City during the previous twelve (12) month period.

2.    Under certain circumstances, the highest paid ten (10) percent of the work force may be denied Family Leave if such leave would cause an economic hardship for the City.

C.    Requirements.

1.    An employee shall be entitled to a total of twelve (12) weeks of leave during any twelve (12) month period for any of the following reasons or combination of the following reasons:

a.    The birth of a child and to care for the newborn child;

b.    Placement of a child with an employee for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child;

c.    In order to care for the serious health condition of a spouse, child or parent of the employee;

d.    Due to a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the duties of the position held.

2.    Calculation of the FMLA leave eligibility is based on a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. In other words, each time an employee takes FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement would be any balance of the twelve (12) weeks that has not been used during the immediately preceding twelve (12) calendar months. A request of FMLA leave generally will not be approved if the employee has already used twelve (12) weeks of leave under this policy during the twelve (12) months preceding the date the employee requested to begin FMLA leave.

3.    Family Leave, other than for the birth or adoption of a child, may be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule where medically necessary. Where intermittent leave is foreseeable, the employee must request such leave in advance. Before intermittent leave may be taken, the City may temporarily assign the employee to an alternate position (having equivalent pay and benefits) that better accommodates the employee’s leave requirements.

4.    For the purposes of this chapter, a "serious health condition" shall be defined as an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition involving either inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical facility, including any period of incapacity related thereto or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care, or continuing treatment by a certified health care provider, which includes:

a.    Any period of incapacity that involves absence from work for more than three (3) calendar days, and any subsequent treatment period of incapacity relating to the same condition that also involves (i) treatment two (2) or more times by a health care provider, or (ii) treatment by a health care provider on at least one (1) occasion that results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider; or

b.    Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care; or 

c.    Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic or long-term health condition that requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, continues over an extended period of time, and may cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity; or

d.    A period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective for such conditions as Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, or terminal stages of disease; or

e.    Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a health care provider either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that is so serious that it would likely result in incapacity for three (3) or more calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer, severe arthritis, or kidney disease. 

f.    A regimen of continuing treatment that includes taking over-the-counter medication such as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves, bed rest, drinking fluids, exercise, or other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care provider is not by itself sufficient to constitute a "regimen of continuing treatment."

D.    Paid/Unpaid Leave.

1.    Before unpaid Family Leave will be granted, an employee must first exhaust any accrued leave banks.

2.    Any paid leave (i.e., personal or sick) granted during a Family Leave period shall be counted towards the annual total twelve (12) work weeks of Family Leave.

E.    Employee Notice.

1.    If the necessity for Family Leave is foreseeable by an employee (i.e., expected childbirth, adoption), an employee must provide his/her department head with not less than thirty (30) days’ notice before the date the leave is to begin.

2.    If Family Leave is based on foreseeable and/or planned medical treatment of a spouse, child (son and/or daughter), parent or an employee’s own treatment, an employee must:

a.    Make a reasonable effort to schedule such treatment as to not disrupt essential operation(s) of the department;

b.    Provide his/her department head with not less than thirty (30) days’ notice before the date the leave is to begin.

3.    In case of any unforeseeable leave, the employee must notify his/her department head or supervisor of the nature of the leave as soon as possible under the circumstances.

F.    Husband and Wife–Both City Employees. If a husband and wife are both employed by the City, the total aggregate number of work weeks of Family Leave will be limited to twelve (12) total work weeks during any twelve (12) month period for the purposes of caring for a new child or a sick parent.

G.    Medical Certification.

1.    In order for an employee to be granted Family Leave due to medical treatment of a spouse, child (son and/or daughter), parent or an employee’s own treatment, a certificate from the health care provider is required. The certificate must include:

a.    The date on which the condition commenced and its probable duration;

b.    An explanation of the conditions and certification detailing into which category of "serious health condition" the patient’s problem falls;

c.    Whether intermittent leave is necessary;

d.    If the condition is chronic or is pregnancy, whether the patient is incapacitated; 

e.    The duration of episodes of any incapacity;

f.    Probable number of additional medical treatments;

g.    Where leave is intermittent, the number of periods of leave and the interval between the treatments;

h.    A description of the regimen of treatment, if required; 

i.    In the case of an employee’s own condition, (i) whether the employee is able to perform work of any kind, (ii) if so, whether he or she is unable to perform one (1) or more of the essential functions of the job, and (iii) if the employee must leave work for treatment; and

j.    If the leave is to care for a family member, whether the patient requires assistance for basic medical or personal needs, safety, transportation, or psychological comfort.

2.    Statements from health care providers shall be given to the department head for review and approval. When the need for medical leave is foreseeable, the employee should provide certification from a health care provider before the leave begins. If this is not possible, the employee must provide the certification within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the request for leave.

3.    The City reserves the right to have the employee obtain a second opinion or third opinion if necessary, at the City’s expense, regarding certifications by providers.

4.    Employees on Family Leave are required to inform their department heads at least every thirty (30) days as to their status and possible return to work. The City reserves the right to require an employee to obtain subsequent recertification(s) from a health care provider upon the expiration of the previous certification.

H.    Replacement During Family Leave. The City reserves the right to replace an employee, on a temporary basis, while such employee is on Family Leave.

I.    Return From Family Leave.

1.    As a condition of restoration, an employee returning from Family Leave must provide his/her department head with a certification from the attending health care provider that he/she can return to work. The certification must outline what duties the returning employee can assume (i.e., normal duties, can lift only ten (10) pounds, etc.).

2.    An employee returning from Family Leave, who is capable of performing his/her job functions, shall be:

a.    Restored to the same position held when the leave commenced; or

b.    Restored to a comparable position with equivalent benefits, pay, etc.

J.    Health Benefits.

1.    Employee Coverage.

a.    For an employee on Family Leave, the City shall maintain and continue to pay for the employer’s portion of the employee’s medical coverage under the City’s health plan. Should the employee exhaust all paid leave and payroll deduction no longer be available, arrangements must be made with the Human Resources Department by the employee to pay the employee’s portion of benefit premiums.

b.    If the employee fails to return from Family Leave after the period of leave expires, all premiums paid for group health coverage during the period of unpaid Family Leave will be recovered from the employee if the failure to return is for reasons other than continuation of the health condition or other reasons beyond the employee’s control.

2.    Dependent Coverage. Employees on Family Leave who have dependent health coverage shall bear the responsibility to maintain and continue to pay for dependent medical coverage, if the employee so chooses. The City shall continue to pay the normal rate for employee’s dependent coverage. Arrangements to pay for dependent medical coverage are to be made with the Human Resources Department prior to the commencement of the Family Leave.

K.    Leave Accruals. Annual and sick leaves shall not accrue during the period of Family Leave. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 883, 2002; Ord. 859, 2001; Ord. 670 § 1(604), 1995)

3.24.050 Workers’ Compensation/Managed Care Program

A.    Workers’ compensation benefits covering accidental injury, disability, disease or death which occurs as a result of employment and is job-related are provided for City employees including individuals in temporary, emergency, intermittent and volunteer status at no cost to employees.

B.    Workers’ compensation benefits (medical) in the amounts provided by Arizona Revised Statute (ARS) will commence on the first day of disability. If the employee is not working (lost time) due to an injury or illness, payment of compensation (lost earnings) will commence on the eighth full calendar day of disability in maximum amounts as provided by current rules and regulations of the Industrial Commission of Arizona. If the employee is not working (lost time) after the fourteenth full calendar day of disability, payments will also be made for the first seven (7) calendar days of disability. The disability or illness can only be recognized when confirmed in writing by a certified physician. The amount compensated will be sixty-six and two-thirds (66-2/3) percent of the current statutory monetary limitation (two thousand one hundred dollars ($2,100)/month as of July 1, 1991, or as changed by the Arizona Legislature) or sixty-six and two-thirds (66-2/3) percent of the employee’s gross monthly salary or wages at the time of injury or illness, whichever is less.

C.    An eligible employee unable to work due to an on-the-job injury or illness may be granted workers’ compensation leave for a period up to ninety (90) calendar days from the date of injury or illness. If the employee is still unable to return to full work status after ninety (90) calendar days, the provisions of the managed care program or ADA will apply.

D.    An eligible employee may elect to use sick leave in order to receive his/her full salary from the City or he/she may elect to use sick leave to supplement workers’ compensation benefits to approximate the employee’s normal take-home pay. Annual (vacation) leave pay may be used after all accumulated sick leave has been used. After all leave is used, employees will receive only workers’ compensation.

E.    Every injury or illness sustained on the job, no matter how trivial, must be reported immediately to the employee’s supervisor so that the employee can be referred to the designated treatment facility. In this way, prompt first-aid treatment can be given or immediate medical assistance secured if necessary. The time of an injury, names of witnesses and reporting of same is important when establishing a claim under the workers’ compensation laws.

1.    Once an employee has reported an on-the-job injury or illness to his/her supervisor, the supervisor shall:

a.    If the injury requires medical attention, refer the employee to a healthcare provider of the employee’s choice, usually the employee’s own private physician;

b.    If the injury is severe or one that requires immediate aid, arrange for treatment at the nearest emergency treatment center (nearest hospital);

c.    Complete a "Supervisors’ Report of Industrial Injury" form:

i.    Employee is to give the form to the health care provider for completion;

ii.    After examination, the employee is to return the form to his/her supervisor, who shall forward same to the Human Resources Department;

F.    Employees returning to work from workers’ compensation leave must provide medical certification of their ability to return to their normal duties.

G.    Managed Care Program. The City in cooperation with the Arizona Municipal Workers Compensation Pool has adopted a managed care program. This program is designed to provide quality care for an injured employee, provide lost time for injured employees an opportunity to return to productive work early and reduce expense to the City, the Arizona Municipal Workers Compensation Pool and the employee. By being more involved with an injured employee, the City demonstrates concern for the welfare of its employees and provides a safer workplace for the employees. This program is designed to provide workers’ compensation insurance at the lowest possible costs through a mutual commitment to a comprehensive managed care program. The following goals have been established to accomplish this objective:

1.    Preaccident management: through a cooperative effort, reduce workplace accidents, injuries and illness through identification, elimination or control of workplace exposures.

2.    Incident response procedures: develop response procedures to be followed after every occurrence that could result in injury or illness.

3.    Disability management: provide a coordinated effort to ensure injured workers receive appropriate medical treatment which leads to the earliest return to work possible.

4.    Post-accident evaluation: conduct a comprehensive analysis of each injury to determine if modifications to the managed care program are needed. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 883, 2002; Ord 859, 2001; Ord. 670 § 1(605), 1995)

3.24.051 Workers’ Compensation Return-to-Work Program

A.    Responsibility. Every employee of the City of Winslow has a responsibility to minimize loss exposure as a factor in the work place by strictly observing safety and standard operating policies and procedures. The term "loss exposure," as applied to the workplace, is defined as the potential for accidents which result in illness or injury.

B.    Policy.

1.    Employees of the City of Winslow who are, or could be, on leave of absence from their duties as a result of a work-related illness or injury may be eligible for the return-to-work program upon written certification or a medical care provider. The medical care provider must certify that the employee may return to work with restrictions on physical requirements of the job in question, and that those restrictions are not expected to last for more than ninety (90) days.

2.    A restriction identifies a physical condition which prevents an employee from performing the full scope of his/her job duties as outlined in their job description. There are two (2) types of restrictions: temporary and permanent. Temporary restrictions are defined as those limitations placed on an injured employee by a physician which are relatively short in duration (i.e., the employee is expected to fully recover and to return to normal working conditions). Permanent restrictions are defined as those limitations placed on an employee by a physician which are expected to be long-term (more than one hundred eighty (180) days) or from which recovery is not expected. Those long-term employees who fall into this category are not eligible for participation in the return-to-work program. They may elect to seek alternative employment, or file for a "reasonable accommodation" under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Upon request, the City of Winslow shall provide a "reasonable accommodation" for a qualified employee with a protected disability unless the accommodation would pose undue hardship on the City. 

3.    When an employee is approved for participation in the return-to-work program, primary consideration will be given to job placement within the employee’s department and normal job duties. A secondary consideration will be alternative placement into another department or another assignment. Alternative placement will not be used to avoid the filling of vacancies within the department in question. An employee participating in the return-to-work program is subject to all rules, regulations, policies and procedures of the Personnel Code.

4.    Each situation will stand on its own merit. An employee Return-To-Work form, completed by the physician, noting the employee’s restrictions, will be evaluated by the Human Resources Officer in order to determine whether or not an employee is able to return to his/her assigned position. The Human Resources Officer will then forward a recommendation with appropriate documentation to the injured employee’s department head for final determination.

5.    If an employee is approved for the return-to-work program, he/she shall be provided tasks which fall within the physical restrictions identified by the treating physician. In no case will an employee authorized to participate in the return-to-work program be placed in an area that will pose a threat or safety risk to the City of Winslow, other staff, or the injured employee. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 883, 2002)

1.    The consent of a person who owns, leases, rents, occupies, controls, or has the right to control the property; or

2.    A search warrant from the City Municipal Court Judge authorizing the City to enter the property and relieve the threat of harm.

B.    Any person who owns, leases, rents, occupies, controls, or has the right to control the property who is found to be in violation of this section may be issued a criminal citation for all violations causing the emergency abatement. The Municipal Court Judge may impose monetary reimbursement orders as justified by the violations. (Ord. 1224 (part), 2014: Ord. 1005 (part), 2007)


8.20.120 Lien for Assessment

Such liens shall be subject to and inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances of record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under the provisions of this section pursuant to a "complaint to enforce assessment" shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure and order of sale pursuant to ARS 9-499(D). The City shall have the right to bring an action to enforce the assessment lien by sale of the subject property in the Superior Court of Navajo County, at any time after the recording of the assessment, but failure to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its validity. The recorded assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited therein, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the recording thereof. A prior assessment for the purposes provided in this section shall not be a bar to a subsequent assessment or assessments for such purposes and any number of liens on the same private premises may be enforced in the same action. Any present water service delivered to the site will also be assessed the charges and billed the entire amount until satisfied by payment. If the lot is unimproved, permit issuance for any improvements and requests for utility services will be denied until such charges are paid in full.

B.    Policy.

1.    No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, by-passed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.

2.    The customer’s system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the Winslow water department to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the water supervisor shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with the state and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

3.    An approved backflow prevention assembly shall also be installed on each service line to a customer’s water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being serviced; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:

a.    In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the water supervisor, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard.

b.    In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.

c.    In the case of premises that have: (1) internal cross-connection that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line.

4.    The type of protective assembly required under subsection (B)(3)(a) through (c) of this section, shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:

a.    In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection (B)(3)(a) of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.

b.    In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.

c.    In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.

e.    In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises.

5.    Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the water supervisor. The term "approved backflow prevention assembly" shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association entitled: * AWWA C506-84 Standards for Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Devices; and, have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California established by Specifications of Backflow Prevention Assemblies –  Section 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control.

Said AWWA and FCCC and HR standards and specifications have been adopted by the water supervisor. Final approval shall be evidenced by a certificate of approval issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with the AWWA standards and FCCC and HR specifications.

The following testing laboratory has been qualified by the water supervisor to test and certify backflow preventers:

Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research

University of Southern California, University Park

Los Angeles, California 90089

Testing laboratories other than the laboratory listed above will be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the water supervisor.

Backflow preventers which may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by the qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory’s current list of approved backflow prevention assemblies may be used without further test or qualification.

6.    It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made upon installation and at lease once per year. In those instances where the water supervisor deems the hazard to be great enough he may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer’s representative, or by a certified tester approved by the state of Arizona. It shall be the duty of the water supervisor to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the water supervisor in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that an official representative may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever the assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the water supervisor.

7.    All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved devices for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (B)(6) of this section, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water supervisor is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the water supervisor finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section. (Ord. 661 (part), 1994: prior code § 42)

15.16.010 Statutory Authorization

In A.R.S. § 48-3610, the Arizona State Legislature enabled the City of Winslow to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3603 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Winslow, Arizona, does ordain as follows. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.020 Findings of Fact

A.    The flood hazard areas of the City of Winslow are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B.    These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when such obstructions are inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.030 Purpose

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A.    Protect human life and health;

15.16.040 Methods of Reducing Flood Losses

These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:

A.    Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B.    Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C.    Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D.    Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E.    Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)

"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

"Flood insurance study (FIS)" means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that includes flood profiles, flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

"Flood or flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: (1) the overflow of floodwaters; (2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or (3) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition.

"Floodplain Administrator" means the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

"Floodplain Board" means the City Council of Winslow, at such times as they are engaged in the enforcement of this chapter.

"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood prone areas. This term describes Federal, State or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

"Floodplain or flood prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flood or flooding."

"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.

"Flood-related erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

"Flood-related erosion area management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.

"Flood-related erosion area or flood-related erosion prone area" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which, due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

"Floodway" means the area of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway."

"Floodway fringe" means that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted.

"Fraud and victimization," as related to Sections 15.16.270 through 15.16.290, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council of Winslow will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

"Governing body" means the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

"Hardship," as related to Sections 15.16.270 through 15.16.290, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Winslow requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors’ opinions and decisions likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure or next to the outside walls of an existing structure.

"Historic structure" means any structure that is:

1.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2.    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3.    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

4.    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either:

a.    By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or

b.    Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

"Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. See "Basement." An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.

"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

"Market value," used in the determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage as defined in this chapter, shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed.

1.    The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry.

2.    The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain Administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence.

Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

"Mean sea level," for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, means the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

"New construction," for the purposes of determining insurance rates, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial flood insurance rate map or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the community.

"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

"One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. See "Base flood elevation."

"Person" means an individual or the individual’s agent, a firm, partnership, association or corporation, or an agent of the aforementioned groups, or this State or its agencies or political subdivisions.

"Program deficiency" means a defect in a community’s floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations.

"Public safety and nuisance," as related to Sections 15.16.270 through 15.16.290, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstruct the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:

1.    Built on a single chassis;

2.    Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3.    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

4.    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

"Regulatory flood elevation (RFE)" means an elevation one (1) foot above the base flood elevation for a watercourse for which the base flood elevation has been determined and shall be determined by the criteria developed by the Director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources for all other watercourses.

"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

Sheet Flow Area. See "Area of shallow flooding."

"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a flood boundary and floodway map or flood insurance rate map as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, or AH.

"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive loss."

"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2.    Any alteration of a "historic structure"; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a "historic structure."

"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

"Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. "Watercourse" includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. (Ord. 1280 (part), 2017; Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.060 Land to Which This Chapter Applies

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the corporate limits of the City of Winslow. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.070 Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study (FIS), Navajo County, Arizona and Incorporated Areas" dated September 26, 2008, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated September 26, 2008, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping are the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the Floodplain Board by the Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Board, within its area of jurisdiction, shall delineate (or may, by rule, require developers of land to delineate) for areas where development is ongoing or imminent, and thereafter as development becomes imminent, floodplains consistent with the criteria developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources. The FIS and FIRM panels are on file at Winslow City Hall, 21 Williamson Avenue, Winslow, Arizona. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.080 Compliance Required

15.16.260 Floodways

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.16.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A.    Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B.    If the requirements of this section are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.16.200 through 15.16.250. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.270 Variances

The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owner(s). The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owner(s), or to any other features added to the property by the owner(s).

It is the duty of the City of Winslow to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.280 Appeal Board

A.    The Floodplain Board of Winslow shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B.    The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C.    In passing upon such applications, the Floodplain Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and

1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.    The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges.

D.    Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the Floodplain Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

E.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1.    The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and

2.    Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and

3.    The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of State land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Navajo County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

F.    The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 1211 (part), 2013)


15.16.290 Conditions for Variances

A.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of Sections 15.16.180 through this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B.    Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D.    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

E.    Variances shall only be issued upon a:

1.    Showing of good and sufficient cause;

2.    Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

3.    Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in Section 15.16.050 in the definition of "functionally dependent use"; and

4.    Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

16.12.010 Purpose

The operating principle upon which land areas are subdivided is maintaining compatibility between the City’s natural and built environments. As architectural creativity is encouraged in the design and placement of structures, engineering creativity and sensitivity is expected for open space preservation as well as the placement and relationship of manmade improvements. (Ord. 1244 (part), 2015: Ord. 920 2003, Prior code § 601(A))

(Manual, Amended, 07/22/2003)


16.12.020 General Requirements

Land planning and individual lot designations within each subdivided tract shall be responsive to existing natural conditions and community character. The platting approach shall vary according to development type, required improvements, design themes, amenities and preferred siting configurations.

A.    Lots shall meet the width, depth, frontage, lot size and all other requirements of the specific zone in which the subdivision is located.

B.    All streets, sidewalks, curb and gutter or other right-of-way designated for use, and all water, sewer and other public improvements, shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards of the City of Winslow in effect at the time the plat is submitted. In the absence of a specific ordinance the City Engineer shall determine the appropriate design standards in accordance with good engineering practices.

C.    All lots created shall abut a dedicated public street. Private streets are permitted, if developed to City standards per this title.

D.    Insofar as possible, the natural terrain, existing topography and natural vegetation shall be preserved.

E.    Where the property to be subdivided is subject to natural or manmade hazards such as flooding, rock and mud slides, open quarries or abandoned mines, or where there exists shallow water table conditions or polluted water sources, such hazards or conditions shall be identified and the subdivider shall provide documentation as to how the hazards or conditions have been eliminated, or will be eliminated, through the design and construction of the subdivision.

F.    No single lot shall be divided by a municipal or county boundary line, a public road or street, or a private road or street which can legally be used by property owners other than the owner of the lot.

G.    Each lot in the subdivision shall be served by the City of Winslow public sanitary sewer system.

H.    Each lot in the subdivision shall be served by the City of Winslow public water system.

I.    At the time of the application for preliminary plat, the subdivider shall provide a drainage system design which covers the entire subdivision. The design shall accommodate runoff from the entire subdivision and the historical runoff from areas adjacent to and "upstream" of the subdivision. The design shall insure that runoff from the developed subdivision shall not exceed the historical volumes and velocities discharged onto adjacent property. At the time of the final plat, the subdivider shall include final drainage design for the phase of the subdivision included in the final plat. The final drainage design shall show how the drainage is consistent with the overall drainage system design. (Ord. 1244 (part), 2015: Ord. 920 2003, Prior Code § 601(A & B))

(Manual, Amended, 07/22/2003)


16.12.030 Lot Design

Lot design for all subdivisions shall strive for configurations which encourage efficient property utilization and, whenever feasible, rectangular shapes.

A.    The depth to width ratio shall not be greater than three (3) to one (1).

B.    Side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and should be straight unless otherwise dictated by topography or other physical reasons. Rear lot lines should avoid acute angles with side lot lines and should normally be straight.

C.    No remnants of property shall be left in the subdivision which do not conform to the zoning ordinance. This includes lots to be used for private or public utilities.

D.    Residential corner lots adjacent to arterial or collector roads should be platted ten (10) percent wider than the average width of interior lots on the block face in order to accommodate street-abutting side yard requirements.

E.    Lots with double frontage are discouraged.

F.    Lots adjoining Interstate 40, State Route 87, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, and/or other arterial or collector roads, should be ten (10) percent deeper to provide appropriate protection from noise, air pollution and visual impacts of traffic.

G.    All lots, except for those reserved for open space, shall be capable of being built upon. Any lands which are unsuitable due to size or shape, steepness of terrain, location of water courses, problems with sewerage or driveway grades, or other severe physical conditions should be preserved as natural open space and referred to as common areas.

Purpose and Intent.

The City Council finds that "Sexually Oriented Businesses" as described in this ordinance, because of their very nature, are recognized as having objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated geographically under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas and increasing law enforcement problems. The City Council further finds that specific regulation of these businesses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods, endanger public safety, or decrease the value of surrounding properties. These conditions are established to prevent the concentration or clustering of these businesses in any one area of the City and to restrict their proximity to residential areas, schools, churches, parks, and other public facilities. All distances specified in this section shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the property line of any sexually oriented business to the nearest property line of any other sexually oriented business, school, church, public facility, residential district, or other land use facility specified herein.

The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

a.    Any residential zoning district, or any residential use;

b.    Public or private school having a pre-school or kindergarten curriculum or any one (1) or more of grades one (1) through twelve (12);

c.    Public park or playground;

d.    Church or noncommercial establishment owned or operated by a bona fide religious organization;

2.    The sexually oriented business shall not be located closer than one thousand (1,000) feet from any other sexually oriented business.

3.    The sexually oriented business shall exclude from its premises persons less than eighteen (18) years of age.

4.    The sexually oriented business shall not display signs visible from the exterior of the business except for signs identifying the business as a sexually oriented business.

5.    No materials depicting specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas shall be visible from the exterior of the sexually oriented business.

6.    All off-street parking areas and premise entries of the sexually oriented businesses shall be illuminated from dusk to closing hours of operation with a lighting system which provides an average maintained horizontal illumination of one (1) foot candle of light on the parking surface and/or walkways. This required lighting level is established in order to provide sufficient illumination of the parking areas and walkways serving the sexually oriented businesses for the personal safety of patrons and employees.

7.    It shall be unlawful to operate, permit, or cause to be operated a sexually oriented business between the hours of one a.m. and six a.m. of any particular day.

17.49.010 Purpose and Intent

The purpose of the Airport Protection overlay district is to promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare in the vicinity of the Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport and to protect the long-term viability of Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport as a general aviation facility, by:

A.    Minimizing public exposure to high noise levels and accident hazards generated by airport operations,

B.    Requiring future development to be compatible with the continued operation and planned future expansion of the airport,

C.    Minimizing future conflicts between land uses and excessive noise generated by aircraft, and

D.    Requiring permanent notice of flight operations to property owners within the Airport Protection overlay district.

The intent of the Airport Protection overlay district is to regulate land uses within designated existing or projected airport noise impact areas by:

A.    Specifying acoustical performance standards and limiting development in noise impact areas, and

B.    Prohibiting uses in the landing approach areas (clear zones) and uses penetrating Federal Aviation Administration-designated control surfaces that, if otherwise permitted, would endanger lives, invite destruction of property, or pose a threat to the continuing operation of the airport. (Ord. 1014 (part), 2007)


17.49.020 Definitions

"Airport layout plan (ALP)" means a scaled drawing of existing and proposed land and facilities necessary for the operation and development of the Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport.

"Avigational disclosure" means recordation against the title to real property of notice of potential imposition upon such real property of excessive noise, vibration, emissions, discomfort, inconvenience, interference with use and enjoyment, and/or any other adverse impact, due to the operation of aircraft to and from the Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport.

"Avigational easement" means an easement in airspace above the surface of real property where necessary to permit imposition upon such real property of excessive noise, vibration, emissions, discomfort, inconvenience, interference with use and enjoyment, and/or any other adverse impact, due to the operation of aircraft to and from the Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport.

"Day-night average noise level (DNL)" means the time-weighted day/night average of a noise level for a twenty-four (24) hour time period, in decibels, for the period from midnight to midnight, obtained after the addition of a ten (10) decibel penalty to sound levels for the periods between midnight and seven a.m. (7:00 a.m.), and between ten p.m. (10:00 p.m.) and midnight, local time. The day-night average noise level has as its base the A-weighted sound level which is designed to approximate the response of the human ear to sound.

"Decibel (dB)" means the physical unit commonly used to describe noise levels.

"Noise level reduction (NLR)" means the amount of noise level reduction in decibels between outdoor and indoor levels achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation in the design and construction of a structure.

"Runway protection zone (RPZ)" means the trapezoidal area off the end of the runway that serves to enhance the protection of people and property on the ground in the event an aircraft lands or crashes beyond the runway end. Runway protection zones underlie a portion of the approach closest to the airport. The primary purpose of the RPZ is the protection of people and property on the ground from both obstructions and incompatible land uses. (Ord. 1014 (part), 2007)


17.49.030 Unique Operational Features and Hazards

Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport contains a United States Forest Service Air Tanker Base that serves as the primary staging area for fixed-wing air tankers serving all of north central and northeastern Arizona. The base supports a variety of air tankers, including the four-engine Lockheed P2-V Neptune and P-3 Orion. Hazards associated with air tanker operations include noise from required high throttle settings for takeoff, the lack of required minimum climb rate and sustained minimum altitude, and the option to discharge an entire load of fire retardant at any point during take-off and departure if an emergency is declared and/or the pilot perceives that the aircraft is in danger.

Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport also contains a twenty-four (24) hour medical evacuation operation serving all of northeastern Arizona, which utilizes turbine-powered fixed-wing aircraft, including the Beech/Raytheon King Air, and turbine-powered helicopters, including the Bell Jet Ranger. (Ord. 1014 (part), 2007)


17.49.040 Applicability

A.    Within the City of Winslow. The Airport Protection overlay district shall apply in addition to, and shall overlay, all other zoning districts where it is applied, so that any parcel of land lying in the Airport Protection overlay district shall also lie in one (1) or more of the other zoning districts provided for by Title 17 of this Code. The effect is to create a new district which has the characteristics and limitations of the overlying district. In any situation where a conflict arises, the more strict regulation(s) shall apply.

B.    Annexation Areas. The Airport Protection overlay district shall apply in addition to, and shall overlay, all other zoning districts where it is applied, on annexed property located within the boundaries described below, and on annexed property located within Section 34 of Township 19 North, Range 15 East, and Sections 17 and 31 of Township 19 North, Range 16 East of the Gila and Salt River Meridian. (Ord. 1014 (part), 2007)


17.49.050 Establishment of Overlay Districts and Boundaries

A.    Airport Protection Overlay District Boundaries. The Airport Protection overlay district boundaries shall be, for the Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport, those areas within the city limits of Winslow, described as follows:

Sections 1 and 2 of Township 18 North, Range 15 East, Sections 13, 14, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 35 and 36 of Township 19 North, Range 15 East, and Sections 18, 19, 29, 30, 32 and 33 of Township 19 North, Range 16 East of the Gila and Salt River Meridian.

B.    Airport Noise Overlays and Clear Zones. For purposes of administering these regulations, there shall be three (3) airport noise overlay areas, and one (1) clear zone overlay area as identified below, within the Airport Protection overlay district for the Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport. Noise contours delineated in the official zoning maps shall be derived from High-Range General Aviation and U. S. Forest Service flight operations forecasts described in the Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport Comprehensive Master Plan 1998, as amended. The boundaries for airport noise overlays and clear zone overlays shall be as defined in the official zoning maps:

1.    Airport Noise Overlay-One (ANO-1): The area between the year 2017/2018 fifty-five (55) DNL and sixty-five (65) DNL noise contour lines developed by the application of the day-night average noise level methodology of noise measurement (DNL).

2.    Airport Noise Overlay-Two (ANO-2): The area between the year 2017/2018 sixty-five (65) DNL and seventy-five (75) DNL noise contour lines developed by the application of the day-night average noise level methodology of noise measurement (DNL).

3.    Airport Noise Overlay-Three (ANO-3): The area within the year 2017/2018 seventy-five (75) DNL and greater noise contour lines developed by the application of the day-night average noise level methodology of noise measurement (DNL).

17.50.010 Purpose

The planned area development (PAD) district is intended to accommodate, facilitate and promote creatively designed developments containing residential and nonresidential uses, which together comprise an attractive, harmonious element of the community. Contemplated planned developments include large-scale, self-contained individual communities or neighborhoods; smaller projects requiring flexibility due to unique circumstances or design characteristics; or transitional areas between different land uses. If specified at the time of zoning approval, the planned area development may include standards and/or requirements that differ from regulations pertaining to other districts.

The PAD shall be approved as an independent zoning district, and not as an overlay. This district, which may only be developed in accordance with an approved development plan, is further established to provide both the developer and the City with assurance that specific proposed uses, intensities and phasing are consistent with the adopted General Plan. (Ord. 1073 (part), 2008)


17.50.020 Objectives

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all PAD documents, and any additional or supplemental information that is deemed necessary by the City to meet the following objectives:

A.    To allow and promote, or to require, variation in building design, lot arrangements and land uses for a maximum choice in the types of environments for residential, commercial, and industrial uses and facilities;

B.    To provide for a coordinated, visually and functionally linked, and compatibly arranged variety of land uses through innovative site planning;

C.    To include circulation that incorporates complete streets within the final PAD plan, interconnection of uses by non-motorized vehicles or transit, and safe interconnection of the PAD with surrounding land uses and transportation systems;

D.    To establish and maintain useable open space that is accessible by all residents and users in the PAD;

E.    To minimize adverse environmental impacts on surrounding areas; and

F.    To fulfill the goals, objectives, and policies of the City of Winslow General Plan and amendments thereto. (Ord. 1073 (part), 2008)


17.50.030 Definitions

"Complete streets" means streets accessible to all users, with full-width paving, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, benches and solid waste receptacles, vehicular and pedestrian lighting, right-of-way landscaping, stormwater drainage facilities, directional and street signage, and designated bicycle lanes.

"Development Review Board" means a board composed of the City Manager, Fire Chief, Police Chief, Building Official, Environmental Services Director, Street and Fleet Manager, Community Development Director, City Engineer, Principal Planner, Planning and Zoning Commission Chairman, and, as needed, representatives from other public entities, including but not limited to public utility companies, school districts, and the Arizona Department of Transportation. The purpose of the Development Review Board is to assure compliance of proposed development with all applicable public health and safety requirements.

"Extension of time" means a request to extend time requirements of this title and/or conditions of approval of the final PAD plan regarding obtaining building permits and/or completion of required public improvements.

"Floor area ratio (FAR)" means the ratio of building floor area to gross lot area of a building site.

"Open space" means public or private outdoor areas that are open to the sky, except for structures that are open on at least three (3) sides (or two hundred seventy (270) degrees, if round) if covered and/or any necessary unoccupied service structures. Examples of open space include yards, parks, golf courses, conservation areas, required landscaping, and fields for games/athletic activities. Required parking/loading areas and roads shall not be considered as open space.

Planned Area Development (PAD). A planned area development shall:

1.    Be a single development project or a definitely programmed series of development projects.

2.    Include principal and accessory structures and uses substantially related to the character and purposes of the district.

3.    Be developed according to a development plan that includes the locations of land uses, streets, utilities, all buildings, other uses and improvements on the land.

4.    Include a program for provision, finance, operation, and maintenance of any areas, facilities, and improvements designated for common and/or public use.

5.    Allow for the application of height, bulk, setback, and other zoning regulations for a particular use over the entire area of that use, as located in the PAD development plan, rather than by application of such standards to individual parcels.

"Zoning Administrator" means the person designated by the City Manager to administer and enforce the ordinances contained in the zoning code. (Ord. 1073 (part), 2008)


17.50.040 Permitted Uses

All uses permitted in the PAD District are determined by an approved development plan for the site.

17.60.200 Administrative Adjustments

A.    Purpose. The purpose of administrative adjustments is to provide a streamlined approval procedure for minor modifications of selected zoning standards.

B.    Applicability. Administrative adjustments may be approved to:

1.    Allow development that is more consistent with the established character of an existing neighborhood than would result if strict compliance with the requirements in this zoning ordinance were required;

2.    Provide flexibility to promote rehabilitation and reuse of existing buildings when such flexibility will not adversely affect nearby properties or neighborhood character; and

3.    Provide limited flexibility for new construction when necessary to address unusual development conditions when such flexibility will not adversely affect nearby properties or neighborhood character.

C.    Authorized Administrative Adjustments.

1.    The Community Development Director is authorized to approve administrative adjustments of up to ten (10) percent from any dimensional requirement(s) set forth in this zoning ordinance (including lot area, lot dimensions, lot coverage, setbacks, building height and any other requirements stated in feet or square feet) under circumstances meeting the approval criteria set forth in subsection E of this section. For example, if the minimum lot size for a single-family residence is twelve thousand (12,000) square feet, the Community Development Director may grant an administrative adjustment of up to one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet, to allow a residence on a ten thousand eight hundred (10,800) square foot lot.

2.    For new development, any request for more than two (2) administrative adjustments on any one (1) parcel shall be reviewed as a variance, in accordance with Section 17.100.080.

3.    No administrative adjustments shall be approved for: reductions in allowable minimum sizes for vehicle parking spaces and access driveways, reductions in permitted heights of buildings or structures, and reductions in dimensions or areas not consistent with the building and life safety codes adopted pursuant to Title 15.

D.    Fractional Rounding Criteria. Fractional dimensions, areas, and other quantities resulting from administrative adjustment calculations shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number if the fractional value is 0.5 or greater, and rounded down to the nearest whole number if the fractional value is 0.4 or less.

E.    Approval Criteria. The Community Development Director may approve an administrative adjustment only upon a finding of fact that the application complies with all of the following approval criteria:

1.    The requested administrative adjustment is consistent with the purpose of this title, as set forth in Section 17.04.030, and this section;

2.    That the alleged hardship caused by literal interpretation of provisions of this title includes more than personal inconvenience and/or financial hardship, and is not the result of actions of the applicant;

3.    That granting an administrative adjustment will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other land, structures, and/or buildings in the same zoning district;

4.    That granting an administrative adjustment will not interfere with or substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of adjacent conforming properties in the same zoning district;

5.    That the level of deviation from dimensional requirements set forth in this title allowed by the administrative adjustment is the minimum necessary to alleviate the alleged hardship on the property; and

6.    That any adverse impacts on surrounding properties resulting from the administrative adjustment will be mitigated to the maximum extent feasible.

F.    Conditions of Approval. The Community Development Director may impose conditions upon the property that are necessary to reduce or minimize any potentially adverse impact on other properties in the neighborhood, and to carry out the purpose of this title, as stated in Section 17.04.030, and this section.

G.    Administration. Requests for administrative adjustments shall be submitted in writing to the Community Development Director and shall state the reasons why strict compliance would not be desirable or feasible, and how the approval criteria will be fulfilled with the granting of an administrative adjustment. The Community Development Director shall respond with an approval or denial in writing. An administrative adjustment that is granted shall be recorded in the files of the Community Development Department. An administrative adjustment shall run with the land.

H.    Appeals. If an administrative adjustment is denied, the applicant may appeal to the Board of Adjustment for a variance, which shall be granted or denied in accordance with the standards applicable to variances, as set forth in Section 17.100.080. (Ord. 1319 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018)

17.68.020    General Regulations

17.68.030    Permit Application

17.68.040    Fees


17.68.010 Purpose and Intent

A.    Every zoning district contains certain buildings, structures and uses of land which are normal and complementary to permitted principal uses in the district, but which, by reason of their typical physical or operational characteristics, influence on the traffic function of adjoining streets, or similar conditions, are often incompatible with adjacent activities and uses.

B.    It is the intent of this title to permit conditional uses in appropriate zoning districts, but only in specific locations within such districts that can be designed and developed in a manner which assures maximum compatibility with adjoining uses.

C.    It is the purpose of this chapter to establish principles and procedures essential to proper guidance and control of such uses. (Ord. 1035 (part), 2007: Ord. 736 Art. XII § A, 1997)


17.68.020 General Regulations

A.    Zoning district regulations established elsewhere in this title specify that certain buildings, structures and uses of the land may be allowed as conditional uses in a given district subject to the provisions of this section and to the requirements set forth in district regulations. The city is empowered to grant and to deny applications for conditional uses and to impose reasonable conditions upon them.

B.    The conditional use permit shall run with the land. Every conditional use permit shall be applicable only to the specific use(s) and the specific property for which it is issued. The maintenance of special conditions imposed, as well as compliance with other provisions of this title, shall be the responsibility of the property owner.

C.    The city shall consider not only the nature of the use and the special conditions influencing its location in the particular district, but also the proposed location of buildings, parking and other facilities within the site, the amount of traffic likely to be generated and how it will be accommodated, and the influence that such factors are likely to exert on adjoining properties.

D.    In order to approve a conditional use, the city must make a finding of fact that the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use of the building and/or the property applied for will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, peace, convenience, comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city.

E.    The city may designate such conditions as it deems necessary to secure the intent and purpose of this title and shall require by annual review such guarantees and evidence that conditions are being or will be complied with. Said review shall be conducted by staff, in the month during which the conditional use permit was originally approved when practicable. Said review shall consist of a site visit, and contact with the owner/operator if necessary to determine if the approved conditional use is active. If the approved conditional use on the subject property is determined to be active and in compliance with conditions of approval, staff shall report a determination of compliance to the planning and zoning commission; and the use shall be permitted to continue until the month of original approval in the following calendar year or until the expiration date of the conditional use permit if said expiration date is earlier than the month of original approval in the following calendar year, with no action by the planning and zoning commission. If the approved conditional use on the subject property is determined to be in violation of conditions of approval or has ceased in the absence of an expiration date, notice of the violation or cessation of use shall be presented to the planning and zoning commission for discussion and possible action during a public hearing. Notice of said annual reviews shall be published quarterly in a publication to be determined by city council. Any change or alteration to the approved conditional use on the property without prior approval by the planning and zoning commission may render the conditional use permit void, or may cause the conditions of approval to be revised or added to by the planning and zoning commission.

F.    Conditional use permits granted for permanent or long-term uses, with no conditions attached, shall not require a periodic review. Examples include a public school, and a residence in a commercial or industrial zone.

G.    An existing conditional use permit may be terminated upon written and signed request from the owner of the property which is subject to the conditional use permit. (Ord. 1124, 2010; Ord. 1035 (part), 2007: Ord. 902, 2002; Ord. 736 Art. XII § B, 1997)

(Manual, Amended, 01/08/2003)


17.68.030 Permit Application

A.    Application for a conditional use shall be submitted to the zoning administrator to be scheduled for public hearing.

B.    The zoning administrator shall publish a legal notice of the public hearing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing and no more than thirty (30) days prior to the meeting. In addition, the zoning administrator shall place a public hearing notice on the property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.

C.    Applications for conditional use permits shall be heard and decided by the planning and zoning commission. (Ord. 1035 (part), 2007: Ord. 902, 2002; Ord.736 Art. XII § C, 1997)

17.88.010 Generally

A.    This chapter provides for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures, uses and lots. These regulations are designed to protect the rights of legally existing nonconforming uses, structures and buildings, but not promote expansion or enlargement. The site, building, structure or use will be encouraged to convert to a conforming use in the future.

B.    Any use or activity lawfully conducted under county zoning regulations at the effective date of annexation or under previous zoning regulations in effect at the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, or any amendment, shall be considered a legal nonconforming use under this title.

C.    The city council, by ordinance, may authorize the acquisition of private property by purchase or condemnation for removal of nonconforming uses and structures. (Ord. 736 Art. XVII § A, 1997)


17.88.020 Restrictions

A.    No structural or physical alteration shall be made to any nonconforming building, structure or lot except when required by law or ordinance. This requirement does not prohibit routine repairs or maintenance.

B.    Nonconforming structures listed on the National or State Register of Historic Buildings may be renovated, restored, repaired or maintained if done in accordance with the state guidelines for historic preservation, regardless of the nonconformance of the building.

C.    Nonconforming structures located within a historic district may be renovated, restored, repaired or maintained if done in accordance with state guidelines on historic preservation.

D.    No expansion shall be made of any nonconforming building, structure or use unless such expansion conforms to the regulations specified for the district in which it is located. In cases where the nonconforming use occupies a building, structure or any portion of a site, expanding the use into additional building or land area shall constitute an extension and shall not be allowed.

E.    Any nonconforming building, structure or use, or one or more of a group of nonconforming building, structure or use related to one industry and under one ownership, which has been damaged by fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot or act of God, may be reconstructed and used as before, if done within twelve (12) months of such calamity. The city council, after review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, may determine that such delay in reconstruction was caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the owner of the premises and permit a reasonable extension of time for reconstruction. Any district requirements may be waived by the city council, provided the area restored is not more nonconforming than existed at the time of the calamity.

F.    Any nonconforming building, structure or use which ceases to be used for a period exceeding six months or is superseded by a conforming use, shall never again be devoted to the nonconforming use except as otherwise provided in the preceding subsection. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use. This shall not prevent a name change or change in ownership of the same nonconforming use. 

G.    To remain a legal non-conforming use, the following conditions must be met:

1.    No litter shall be allowed to accumulate.

2.    Landscaping must be maintained.

3.    All structure exteriors must be regularly maintained, including wall and roof coverings.

17.88.030 Nonconforming Lots

Any legal lot existing at the time of the enactment of the ordinance codified in this title, or any amendment, which does not conform within lot area, lot width, or lot depth for the zoning district in which it is located, may be used for any use permitted in that zone district, provided all other applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance are complied with. (Ord. 736 Art. XVII § C, 1997)


17.88.040 Development Standards

Development standards relate to the size, configuration and character of development. Development standards include, but are not limited to, items such as parking, landscaping, buffer areas and setback. Developed property may be nonconforming because the development of the property does not meet current zoning ordinance requirements. Property which is nonconforming, due to deficiencies in development standards, shall be regulated as follows:

A.    No change of use or change to a building structure shall be permitted which creates a deficit or increases an existing deficit in off-street parking spaces, loading areas or other development standards.

B.    Any site which is nonconforming due to deficiencies of development standards and which require review or approval by the city council for a conditional use permit, rezoning, site plan or subdivision shall, as a requirement of that review, be brought into conformance including, but not limited to, development standards for parking, circulation, driveways, drainage, storage, screening and landscaping, with the zoning ordinance and other applicable codes before any permit or other request can be approved.

17.96.010 Purpose and Findings

A.    Winslow has an extremely rich and diverse history. Due to its proximity to a reliable water source, Winslow lies in the heart of an area that was home to some of the oldest civilizations on the continent. Throughout time its location has presented the opportunity to witness the many phases of westward migration, from the early wagon trains through the railroad years; the advent of the automobile and Route 66; and now Interstate 40. The architecture of most of these phases of development can still be seen throughout the city.

B.    These phases in history combine to create the character of the community today. By preserving the significant sites and districts we can retain an appreciation for the past as we continue to develop into the next millennium.

C.    By preserving entire districts we can create a sense of place that will enhance the community image; serve as a stimulus to economic development by attracting tourists; and increase the property values throughout the district.

D.    A historic district is a single building, site, structure or object or group of buildings, sites, structures or objects, including signs, and which meet the criteria established by the National Register of Historic Places which states that the quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association and:

1.    That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or

2.    That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

3.    That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or

4.    That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history; or

5.    Relates to events, personages or architectural styles that are at least fifty (50) years old. However, outstanding examples less than fifty (50) years old should be evaluated on their own merits. (Ord. 736 XIX § A, 1997)


17.96.020 Creation of Historic Preservation Commission

A.    Membership.

1.    The Winslow Historic Preservation Commission shall be composed of seven (7) members, appointed by the Mayor and Council, all of whom have demonstrated interest, experience or knowledge in one of the following: history, architecture, planning, archaeology, historic archeology, real estate, historic preservation, law or related field.

2.    To the extent available in the community at least two professionals from the disciplines of architecture, history, planning, architectural history, archaeology, or related historic preservation disciplines such as cultural geography or cultural anthropology should be members of the Historic Preservation Commission. Should no one be available from the community, the Council may hire a consultant. 

3.    Commission members shall be appointed by the City Council to serve no more than three (3), three (3) year staggered terms of office.

In order to give adjacent land owners and other potentially affected citizens an opportunity to express issues or concerns that they may have with a proposed zoning map amendment (rezoning) before a public hearing, the city hereby establishes the following citizen review process for an application for a rezoning. 

The city may require, as a prerequisite to the planning and zoning commission public hearing for any rezoning, a neighborhood meeting to be conducted by the applicant. The purpose of the meeting shall be to provide information to the adjacent property owners and residents, and to allow the neighbors to express any issues or concerns regarding the proposed rezoning prior to the public hearing. The applicant shall be required to notify (at his/her expense) all landowners within three hundred (300) feet of the boundaries of the proposed development, the city of Winslow, and any neighborhood and/or homeowners’ associations on record with the city by first class mail no less than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled planning and zoning commission meeting. The applicant shall submit documentation of the attendees and minutes of the meeting(s) to the city. An employee of the city shall attend the meeting(s), and shall verify applicant’s documentation of the meeting(s) by automated recording and/or manual note-taking. All meeting(s) shall be held within the city of Winslow corporate limits.

E.    In the event that the city does not require a neighborhood meeting pursuant to the above paragraph, the city shall post a written notice of a public hearing for the proposed zoning map amendment pursuant to A.R.S. 9-462.04 and shall send, via first class mail, copies of the proposed amendment to adjacent land owners with a statement on said notice that more information can be obtained from the planning and zoning department, and that written comments maybe provided to the planning and zoning department before the public hearing. The address and telephone number of the planning and zoning department shall be provided with said notice by mail and on the posting. 

F.    The planning and zoning commission shall render a decision in the form of a written recommendation for: (1) approval, (2) approval with conditions, or (3) denial of the petitioned zoning map amendment (rezoning) or zoning text amendment. The recommendation shall then be forwarded to the city council unless withdrawn by the applicant.

G.    The city council shall: (1) approve, (2) approve with conditions, or (3) deny the proposed zoning text amendment or zoning map amendment (rezoning) request. Approval of a petition to rezone land may not be enacted as an emergency measure and the rezoning shall not become effective for at least thirty (30) days after city council approval, pursuant to ARS 9-462.04.

H.    In the instance when an application for a zoning map amendment is submitted concurrently with an application for a conditional use permit and/or subdivision plat approval, both applications may be presented and reviewed concurrently.

I.    Should the proposed zoning map amendment not be in conformance with the Winslow General Plan-Land Use Plan, as required by ARS 9-462.01, an application for an amendment to the Land Use Plan shall be submitted in accordance with ARS 9-461.06, and the Winslow General Plan. (Ord. 1044, 2007; Ord. 1016 (part), 2007: Ord. 736 Art. XI § C, 1997)
