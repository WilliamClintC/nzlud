In the event that the committee is successful in effecting conciliation between the parties or becomes convinced that no discriminatory act was committed, the complaint and all proceedings by the commission and the committee shall be and remain confidential; and any disclosure thereof except as hereinafter authorized, by the secretary or any member of the commission, shall be grounds for removal from office.

The commission shall serve upon the respondent a written statement of the charges made in the complaint and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be held not less than twenty days after the service of the statement of charges.

The chairs of boards and commissions and the mayor have the additional responsibility to intervene when actions of members that appear to be in violation of the code of ethics are brought to their attention.
The city council may impose sanctions on members whose conduct does not comply with the city's ethical standard, such as reprimand, formal censure, loss of seniority or committee assignment, or budget restriction. If there is an ethics issue, council, board or commission member will meet before the city council during a regular city council meeting. The member under Iowa Code Section 21.5(i) can request a closed hearing to discuss the issue. Under city ordinance, the city also may remove members of a board and commission from office by a vote of three-fifths of the city council and to remove a member of the city council from office by a vote of four-fifths of the city council.
A violation of this code of ethics shall not be considered a basis for challenging the validity of a city council, board or commission decision.

(b) Under this chapter the partial exemption from taxation shall be available for a period of five years.
(Ord. 1099 §§ 1, 2, 1980)
3.04.020 - Definitions.
As used in this chapter:
(a) "Actual value added" means that the actual value added as of the first year for which the exemption is received, except that actual value added by improvements to machinery and equipment, means that actual value as determined by the assessor as of January 1st of each year which the exemption is received.
(b) "New construction" means new buildings and structures and includes new buildings and structures which are constructed as additions to existing buildings and structures. New construction does not include reconstruction of an existing building or structure which does not constitute complete replacement of an existing building or structure or refitting of an existing building or structure, unless the reconstruction of an existing building or structure is required due to economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of specific products and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the building or structure to continue to competitively manufacture or process those products, which determination shall receive prior approval from the city council upon the recommendation of the Iowa Department Commission. The exemption shall also apply to new machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant to Section 427.1(1)(e) of the Code of Iowa, unless the machinery or equipment is part of the normal replacement or operating process to maintain or expand the existing operational status.
(Ord. 1099 § 3, 1980)

The granting of the exemption for new construction constituting complete replacement of an existing building or structure shall not result in the assessed value of the industrial real estate being reduced below the assessed value of the industrial real estate before the start of the new construction added.
(Ord. 1099 § 4, 1980)
3.04.040 - Application—Procedure.
(a) An application shall be filed for each project resulting in actual value added for which an exemption is claimed. The application for exemption shall be filed by the owner of the property with the local assessor by February 1st of the assessment year in which the value added is first assessed for taxation. Applications for exemption shall be made on forms prescribed by the director of revenue and shall contain information pertaining to the nature of the improvement, its cost, and other information deemed necessary by the director of revenue.
(b) A person may submit a proposal to the city council to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. The city council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new construction if the new construction is in conformance with the zoning plans for the city. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate. However, if the tax exemption for new construction is not approved, the person may submit an amended proposal to the city council to approve or reject.
(Ord. 1099 § 5, 1980)

A property tax exemption under the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be granted if the property for which the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax exemption authorized by law.

As used in this chapter:
"Emergency errand" means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident, or any other situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury or loss of life.
"Knowingly" means knowledge which a responsible adult should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible adult's custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable community standard of adult responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that an adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
"Minor" means any unemancipated person under the age of eighteen years. "Nonsecured custody" means custody in an unlocked area, such as a lobby, office or interrogation room which is not designed, set aside or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically accompanied by a peace officer or a person employed by the facility where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing nonsecure custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release of the person's parents, or other responsible adult, or for other administrative purposes; but not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or magistrate authorizing the detention.
"Public place" means and includes the city square, shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, streets, alleys, sidewalks dedicated to public use; and shall also include such parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited commercially for a fee or otherwise, or in or on which the general public is permitted without specific invitation, or to which the general public has access.
"Responsible adult" means a parent, guardian or other adult specifically authorized by law, or authorized by a parent or guardian to have custody or control of a minor.

"Permanent sidewalks" means cement concrete sidewalks constructed in accordance with the following:
Standard Specifications for Concrete Sidewalk Construction
City of Centerville, Iowa
(1) Description and dimensions. Portland cement concrete sidewalks shall be composed of Portland cement concrete proportioned, mixed, and constructed on a prepared soil base in accordance with these specifications to a standard thickness of four inches. The standard width shall be not less than four feet but may be increased to greater widths in minimum increments of width of one foot. All walks shall be laid to the grade established therefor by ordinance and with the back line of four walks placed one foot out from the property line and the back line of five-foot and wider walks placed on the property line.
(2) Composition, consistency, and materials. Concrete used shall conform to the following proportions:
Per Bag
Per Cubic Yard
Cement
1 pound
648 pounds
Sand
220 pounds
1520 pounds
Gravel or crushed stone
220 pounds
1520 pounds
It shall be mixed to a uniform consistency, and with a water content such that the slump shall not exceed four inches when tested by the AASHO Standard Method of "Slump Test for Consistency of Portland Cement Concrete", T 119. Sand shall be natural sand, free within a maximum limitation of one and one-half percent of injurious amounts of silt, shale, coal, organic matter, or other deleterious substances. Gravel or crushed stone shall be washed and screened gravel or crushed limestone obtained from ledges in which at least ninety-five percent of the total shall have a percentage of wear not in excess of forty-five when tested in accordance with the current AASHO Standard Method of "Test for Abrasion of Coarse Aggregate", T 96, Grading B. It shall be free of any unsound material in which disintegration is accompanied by an increase in volume.
(3) Construction Method.
(a) Preparation of subgrade. The foundation for sidewalks shall be prepared by excavation or filling to a depth such that the specified depth will be obtained below the established grade line after compaction of the base as specified herein, If filling be required, it shall be done only with natural soil or crushed limestone corresponding to Class A roadstone (at least fifty percent passing #4 sieve and at least twenty-five percent fines or dust). Sand may not be used. The base and any fill shall be thoroughly compacted by tamping or rolling until a smooth, dense, and hard subgrade is obtained.
(b) Forming. Wood or steel forms shall be used to form a straight edge set true to line and grade. If wood they shall be not less than one and five-eighths inches in thickness and of a width of not less than three and five-eighths inches. Forms shall be set true to line and grade and held rigidly in place by adequate staking placed outside of the forms.
230
(c) Placement and finishing. The subbase shall be thoroughly moistened if dry, and concrete then placed in successive batches to the full depth and width of the slab in one operation. It shall be thoroughly spaded along the edge and tamped to eliminate voids. A flat surface shall be generated by operation of a screed across the top of the forms, filling any low places as the screed progresses. After the final surface elevation and flatness have been obtained by the screed and any unavoidable floating, the entire surface shall be steel troweled to obtain a dense, smooth surface. Troweling shall be delayed until the concrete has set long enough to work correctly under the trowel and should be interrupted on any section when excess water has been flushed to the surface, After absorption of the water, troweling can be resumed. When the final steel trowel finish has been obtained, the surface should be brushed lightly to obtain a traction surface. The brush shall be such as to cause a fine ribbed finish and not coarse grooves in the surface. It shall be cleaned frequently, but water shall not be carried back onto the surface of the concrete. Edges shall be rounded with a suitable edging tool and walks shall be cross-divided every four feet by cutting on a straight line with a pointed trowel or by use of a metal divider to form joints. Cuts shall be done late enough or else repeated so that a plane of weakness will result. The finished cut shall be edged.
In no case shall dry cement or dry cement and sand be sprinkled on the surface to absorb surface water, and in no case shall water be added to or sprinkled on the surface for ease in finishing.
A curing medium shall be applied after finishing the walk. This may be an impervious white sprayed-on coating or impervious paper or mats, Burlap or any other method which requires periodic wetting may not be used.
(d) Two course construction. Two course construction is approved provided that the topping course is composed of a mixture having the same sand and cement content as the base course, omitting only coarse aggregate, and that such topping be not less than one-half inch in thickness and be placed not longer than two hours after placement of the basic slab.
(e) Jointing. At intervals not exceeding fifty feet, one-half inch thick expansion joints shall be constructed by insertion of a bituminous or asphaltic joint strip. Such joints shall also be used at the meeting of a walk with any building or structure, at sidewalk intersections, at the intersection of house or parking sidewalks with the sidewalk, and where walks meet curbs or any other fixtures in the surface. When sidewalks are constructed between an adjoining permanent structure on one side and a curbing on the other side, continuous expansion joint material shall be installed adjacent to the curbing. Joint strip material shall be set one-fourth to one-half inch below finish grads.
(4) Driveway entrances. Where driveways, paved entries or alleys, crosswalks, the thickness shall be increased to not less than six inches and such crossings shall be reinforced either by the use of 6 × 6 - 6/6 mesh or three one-half inch reinforcing bars set lengthways. The grade elevation of such crossings may not be depressed below the sidewalk grade but shall be a continuation of it, and no curbing or step is permitted. Such entrances shall terminate at the outside edge of the curbing and shall not lap over the curb. One inch expansion material shall be used between the end of such entrances and the curbing and one-half expansion material shall be used on either side of the sidewalk if the driveway or slab is not constructed as a continuous slab through the sidewalk. The end of entrance slabs shall be thickened to not less than eight inches where such slabs meet pavements.
Under some circumstances, permission will be given to reduce curb height in which case the cut may be smoothed, if desired, by use of asphaltic or other patching materials, but in no case shall the driveway or entrance slab be constructed beyond the outside or back edge of the curb. Such patching shall not extend beyond the face surface of the remaining curbing and the flow line elevation of the gutter shall not be changed by filling of any sort.
(5) Special construction and fixtures. Wherever fixtures such as manholes, crossing plates, access doors, posts or poles are situated in sidewalks, the effect of expansion and contraction shall be anticipated and extra expansion material used as indicated. Telephone or power poles which must be incorporated
231
into the walk shall be isolated from it by encirclement with an expansion joint strip not less than one-half inch in thickness to the full depth of the sidewalk. Should the fixture be such that no bond is desirable, a heavy coating of asphalt or bituminous material shall be applied to the fixture before placement of concrete. Where sidewalk construction causes damage or destruction of existing curbings, they shall be rebuilt to match similar curbing in new condition. Materials and method of construction shall conform to these specifications and forming shall be carefully done; the concrete shall be cured in the same manner as for sidewalks.
(6) Removal of nonconforming construction. Gutter fillets, and sidewalk driveway and entrance slabs not conforming with established line and grade and this specification may be removed from the street by the city and the expense thereof charged to the abutting property owner.
(7) Standard drawing. A drawing illustrating the herein specified details of construction of sidewalks and driveway and entrance slabs is on file with the city clerk and is made a part of this section by reference.
The contractor or walk builder will be required to provide the proper barriers or lights to properly protect the walks built until they shall become thoroughly set.
(Ord. 895 § 2, 1969).
11.16.020 - Bond required.
No person, partnership or corporation engaged in the building of cement sidewalks shall be allowed to build said walks ordered constructed by the property owner or the city council upon the streets or alleys of the city of Centerville, who shall not first have filed and the city council have approved a bond in the sum of five hundred dollars securing the city and the property owner against poor workmanship or faulty materials or any defects caused thereby, which may appear within a period of two years after the construction; provided, however, that this section does not prevent cement walks, of character as specified in this section from being built by the property owner himself, in which event no bond will be required.
(Ord. 1050 § 2, 1976).
11.16.030 - Removal of snow and ice—Duty—Liability.
It shall be the duty of all property owners whose property abuts on a sidewalk to keep such sidewalk free of snow and accumulation of ice, mud and debris. Failure to so do shall make such property owner liable for any injuries caused by such snow and accumulation of ice, mud and debris. In the event any action is brought against the city for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by such snow or ice accumulation, mud and debris, the city may notify such property owner to appear and defend as provided in Iowa Code Annotated, and require the property owner to pay any judgment obtained against the city as therein provided. Snow, ice or accumulations from abutting property which have remained on any sidewalk for a period of ten hours or more may be removed by the street commissioner without notice to property owner.

12.04.010 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to enable the collection of the cost of operation and maintenance including replacements of the sewage treatment works of the city from all users in proportion to the contribution of wastes by each user to the total waste loading of the treatment works; to recover an amount of revenue sufficient to pay the cost of operation and maintenance including replacement of all treatment works; and to enable collection of revenue at least sufficient to provide for amortization of and payment of interest on indebtedness incurred in the construction of sewage treatment works.
(Ord. 1110 § 1(part), 1983).
12.04.020 - Definitions.
The following listed terms are defined for use in this chapter as follows:
"Base use concentration" means the average concentration of each pollutant in the influent to the sewage treatment works after adjustment to exclude the effect of the wastes of over-base users.
"Base user charge" means a charge levied on all contributors discharging waste into the sanitary sewer system, regardless of concentration of pollutants in said waste.
"BOD" is an abbreviation of biochemical oxygen demand and shall mean the quantity of oxygen utilized in
238
the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedure in five days at twenty degrees C., expressed in parts per million by weight.
"Debt service charge" means a charge per 134 cubic feet of potable water for base users, and per 134 cubic feet of waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system for over-base users, which is levied for the purpose of payment of principal and interest on indebtedness incurred for construction of sewage treatment works.
"Industrial wastes" means the liquid wastes from industrial processes, trades or businesses as distinguished from sanitary sewage.
"Over-base charge" means a surcharge levied on over-base users.
"Over-base user" means a contributor who discharges volumes of waste into the sanitary sewer system which constitutes a significant fraction of the total flow to the treatment works or which have a concentration of pollutants substantially greater than the base concentration.
"pH" means the negative logarithm of the effective concentration of hydrogen ions expressed in grams per liter of solution.
"Pollutants" means any wastes having BOD; suspended solids; dissolved or colloidal substances; liquid wastes from industrial processes, trades or businesses; heavy metals; and any and all other substances uncommon to, or in greater concentration than found in, the potable water supply of the city of Centerville.
"Sanitary sewage" means sewage discharging from the sanitary conveniences of dwellings (including apartment houses and hotels), office buildings, factories or institutions, and free from storm, surface water and industrial wastes.
"Sanitary sewer" means a sewer which carries sewage and to which storm, surface and groundwaters are not intentionally admitted.
"Sewage" means a combination of the water-carried wastes from residences, business buildings, institutions, and industrial establishments, together with such ground, surface and storm waters as may be present.
"Sewage treatment works" means all facilities of the city for collecting, pumping, storing, treating and disposing of sewage.

(Ord. 1110 § 1(part), 1983; Ord. 1322 § 1, 2017).
12.04.030 - Persons liable for user charges.
All natural persons, trades, businesses, industries, or corporations who contribute wastes to the city's sewer system by a direct or indirect connection thereto, including premises outside the city boundaries, shall pay debt service and user charges to the city at the rates and in the manner provided in this chapter. The user charge ordinance shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts between the city and users which are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 204(b)(1)(A) of the Act and 40 CFR 35.929-2 dated September 27, 1978.
(Ord. 1119 § 1(part), 1985).
12.04.040 - Method of payment.
239
The billing procedure for debt service and user charges shall be the same as that in use by the municipal water system for sale of potable water. The billing period shall be the same as the billing periods for the municipal water system but not less frequently than monthly, and bills shall be payable with the water bill at the office of the municipal water system. Sewage treatment works user charges and debt service charges shall be separately shown and identified as such on the regular bill used for potable water usage billing.
(Ord. 1110 § 1(part), 1983).
12.04.050 - Base user charge.
The base user charge shall be an amount of money per 294 cubic feet of potable water delivered to contributors during a billing period, and shall be computed for each contributor by multiplying the volume of potable water delivered to each by the base user charge. The latter shall be the rate fixed from time to time as provided herein under Section 12.04.070, and as given herein under Section 12.04.080.
(Ord. 1110 § 1(part), 1983; Ord. 1322 § 2, 2017).
12.04.060 - Over-base user charge.
The over-base user charge shall be an amount of money per additional 134 cubic feet of waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system by over-base users during a billing period. It shall be computed individually for each such user by multiplying the unit cost of treatment of each major distinguishable class of pollutant by the concentration in excess of the base use concentration of the respective pollutant in the waste discharge of the particular over-base user. The sum of these products shall then be multiplied by the volume of sewage discharged into the sanitary sewer system by the over-base user. It shall be recomputed annually, and additionally whenever a substantial change occurs in the composition, concentration, or rate of delivery of wastes discharged by that user.
The superintendent shall obtain and deliver to the clerk information as to the composition, strength, volume, and rate of delivery of sewage from each over-base user by periodic sampling and measurement of the user's sewage. Such sampling and measurement shall be frequent enough to yield representative value, and appropriate units of concentration and volume shall be used. Permanent metering equipment may be installed by the superintendent.
If toxic pollutants, or any substances which singly or by interaction with other substances, cause identifiable increases in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the treatment works, or in the cost of operation, maintenance, or replacement of the treatment works, or cause additional tests to be taken for environmental purposes, the superintendent and clerk shall ascertain the increased costs from these causes by individual case analysis. In addition, if the rate of discharge of sewage by any contributor is of such magnitude as to increase the cost of transportation or treatment, the increased costs from this excessive delivery shall also be ascertained by the superintendent and clerk by individual analysis. Such costs shall then be added to the base user charge of the particular contributors.
(Ord. 1173 § 1, 1994: Ord. 1110 § 1(part), 1983; Ord. 1322 § 3, 2017).
12.04.070 - Determination of rate of charge.
The city clerk, no less frequently than annually, shall ascertain the cost for the preceding year of operation and maintenance including billing, collection, and administrative costs, and the cost of replacements for the sewage treatment works of the city. He shall then determine the unit cost of treatment of each major class of pollutant and of volume of flow and shall calculate rates of charges so as to recover the entire cost of operation and maintenance for the succeeding year, and to maintain an adequate reserve for replacements. This calculation shall be based upon the said cost for the preceding year, adjusted as deemed necessary by the clerk for changed conditions including use of potable water in the succeeding year.
The fraction of the charges dedicated to replacement shall in no event be less than twenty percent of the total of all other operation and maintenance costs unless analysis of replacement experience indicates the need for an increase or reduction in this fraction; provided, however, that this fraction shall be such as to always provide adequate revenues to meet the replacement needs of the treatment works over its service life. The superintendent shall assist
240
the clerk in computations, and engineering assistance may be employed by either for these determinations.
The rate of base user charge and the unit costs of treatment for the succeeding year shall then be fixed by the city council by ordinance so as to recover operation and maintenance costs and any deficiencies in recovery of said costs from preceding years. In the event of excessive balances remaining in the operation and maintenance and replacement accounts, the council may adjust the rate downward appropriately. The currently effective rates shall be as given in Section 12.04.080.
At that same time, the council shall review the user charge system to ascertain that proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs among users and user classes is maintained, and shall revise the charges or system as necessary to assure maintenance of said proportionality.
(Ord. 1110 § 1(part), 1983).
12.04.080 - Rate of user charges.
The base user charge for waste water treatment works is $14.52 per month per user for any usage up to and including 294 cubic feet per month; for any usage over 294 cubic feet per month, there is an additional fee of $3.83 per 134 cubic feet. Each user shall also pay (i) a $3.02 per month maintenance fee for residential use property and a $4.54 per month maintenance fee for commercial use property and (ii) a $20.00 per month surcharge for Iowa Department of Natural Resources (Iowa DNR) mandated sewer system improvements. Users not located within the city limits shall pay an additional one hundred percent monthly surcharge on the sewer usage charges and the sewer surcharge for Iowa DNR mandated sewer system improvements.
Starting July 1, 2013, thirty-five percent (35%) of the revenue derived from Local Option Sales and Service Tax (LOSST) in the City of Centerville will be used to reduce the $20.00 surcharge for Iowa DNR mandated sewer system improvements for users within the city limits. An estimated annual reduction shall be determined by the City Clerk based on the estimated LOSST revenue. The reduction shall be $5.00 per user per month for fiscal year 2017-2018.
(Ord. 1310 § 1, August 4, 2014; Ord. 1322 § 4, 2017).
12.04.085 - Late payment penalty.
Bills not paid when due shall be considered delinquent. A late penalty charge of ten percent shall be added to each delinquent bill. If a bill is sent directly from Centerville City Hall for only wastewater service an additional fee of ten percent shall be added each month.
(Ord. No. 1295, § 1, 6-21-2010).
12.04.090 - Rate of debt service charges.
For base users, the debt service charge shall be sixty-six cents per 294 cubic feet and for over-base users, the debt service charge shall be seventy-six cents per additional 134 cubic feet; and users not located within the city limits shall pay an additional forty percent surcharge.
(Ord. 1173 § 2(part), 1994; Ord. 1150 § 1(part), 1990; Ord. 1322 § 5, 2017).
12.04.095 - Minimum charge.
When combined, the user charge and debt service charge for each contributor shall not be less than seven dollars and fifty cents per month.
(Ord. 1150 § 1(part), 1990).
12.04.100 - Base use concentration.
241
The base use concentration of pollutants shall be established annually by the superintendent from measurements of the average concentration of pollutants in the preceding year in the influent to the treatment works, after making appropriate adjustment to exclude the effect on such average of the strength and volume of wastes discharged by any over-base users. The current values shall be two hundred forty-five milligrams per liter of BOD and two hundred ninety-two mg/l of suspended solids.

(l) Whenever any building or structure is in such a condition as to constitute a public nuisance known to the common law or in equity jurisprudence;
(m) Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of one year so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive nuisance or hazard to the public.

15.18.040 - Notice to owner.
The building official shall examine, or cause to be examined, every building or structure or portion thereof reported as dilapidated, dangerous or damaged and, if such is found to be a dilapidated or unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the building official shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in charge of the building or premises, within forty-eight hours or such reasonable time as the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions thereof, and all such work shall be completed within ninety days from date of notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the building official. If necessary, such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the building official.
This written notice shall be served upon the owner by certified mail, with return receipt requested. If the letter is returned as refused or undeliverable, the notice shall be considered to have been given, and this section is satisfied. Where there is no other record of the owner, the notice may be made by publication one time in any newspaper published in Centerville, Iowa, with a copy sent by ordinary mail addressed to the last address used by the Appanoose County treasurer for the owner of the real estate and any other address known to the building official. The designated period within which the owner or person in charge is required to comply with the order of the building official shall begin as of the date the owner receives such notice or on the date of the publication, whichever is earlier. However, such notice shall, except in cases of immediate danger, state that the person notified may request a hearing before the council concerning the determination that the building be repaired, removed, or demolished. The owner shall make such request in writing and mailed by ordinary mail, or delivered personally, to the city clerk at least three days before the deadline set in the notice if less than fifteen days was set and at least ten days before the deadline if over twenty-one days was set.

If the owner requests a hearing before the city council the owner shall be notified by ordinary mail of the date, time and place of the meeting where the city council shall hear the owner and consider the owner's statements and exhibits, if any, and any information provided by the building official. The hearing may be held at a special meeting of the city council or at a regular meeting. After the hearing the city council may determine whether or not the building is dilapidated, dangerous or damaged as provided for in this chapter and if so may order the building official to take the necessary actions to remedy the building which may include the right to demolish the structure and clean up the lot. In the event that the city council authorizes the building official to take action and remedy the problem the owner shall be so notified and shall have twenty days in which to take an appeal to the Iowa District Court for Appanoose County. In the event that the owner does not appeal within that twenty days then it shall be presumed, and the city shall be entitled to rely upon such presumption, that the owner agrees with the remedy proposed by the city.
As an alternative, or as an additional remedy, the city may proceed under Chapter 1.24 of this code.

No dwelling unit or structure may be sold or conveyed by any means, including by deed, contract, long term lease, or any other means which results in a change of equitable title from the present owner to a third party unless the owner shall have first furnished the grantee, transferee, or lessee a true copy of any notice received from the city pursuant to the terms of Section 15.18.040. The violation of this section is a municipal infraction. Failure to comply with this section shall also make the original owner, together with the new owner, jointly and severally responsible for the compliance with all the terms of this chapter. The city is authorized to file a notice with the Appanoose County recorder stating that the city building inspector has declared the dwelling unit or structure located on the real estate as a dilapidated or unsafe building under this chapter.

(a) The zoning board of adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
(1) Variances shall only be granted upon: (A) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (B) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (C) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
(2) Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(3) In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (A) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (B) such construction increases risks to life and property.
(b) Factors upon which the decision of the City Council shall be based. In passing upon applications for variances, the City Council shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
(2) The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream to the injury of others;
(3) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions;

(6) The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location;
(7) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use;
(8) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(9) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area;
(10) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site;
(12) The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges; and
(13) Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
288
(c) Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the zoning board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
(1) Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
(2) Limitation of periods of use and operation;

Table 17.08A
Purposes of Zoning Districts
Symbol
Title
Purpose
AG
Agricultural/urban reserve
The district provides for and preserves the agricultural and rural use of land, while accommodating very low density residential development generally associated with agricultural uses. This district is designed to maintain complete agricultural uses within the Centerville extra-territorial jurisdiction. In addition, land included in the urban reserve in the comprehensive plan should be retained in the AG district to prevent premature or inappropriate development.
RR
Rural residential
This district provides for the rural residential use of land, accommodating very low and low density residential environments. The district's regulations assure that density is developed consistent with: land use polices of the Centerville comprehensive plan regarding rural subdivisions; levels of infrastructure; and environmentally sensitive development practices. The district also accommodates developments that merge urban living with rural life.
R-1
Single-family residential
This district is intended to provide for residential development, characterized by single-family dwellings on large lots with supporting community facilities and urban services. Its regulations are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.
R-2
Urban family residential
This district is intended to provide for medium density residential development, characterized by single-family dwellings on moderately-sized lots along with low density multi-family dwellings such as duplexes and townhouses. It provides regulations to encourage innovative forms of housing development. It adapts to both established and developing neighborhoods, as well as transitions between single-family residential and multiple-family residential areas. Its regulations are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.
R-3
Multiple-family residential
This district is intended to provide locations primarily for multiple-family dwellings, with supporting and appropriate community facilities. It also permits some nonresidential uses such as offices through a special permit procedure to permit a mixing of uses that have relatively similar operating and development effects.
Table 17.08A
Purposes of Zoning Districts (Cont.)
Symbol Title Purpose
341
R-4
Mobile home residential
This district recognizes that factory-built home development, properly planned, can provide important opportunities for affordable housing. It provides opportunities for factory-built home development within planned parks or subdivisions, along with the supporting services necessary to create quality residential neighborhoods.
UC
Urban corridor
This district recognizes the mixed use character of major urban corridors, such as Maple Street and 18th Street. These corridors sometimes accommodate a combination of residential, commercial, and office uses. Design standards maintain their character as important urban streets.
LC
Limited commercial/ office
This district reserves appropriately located area for office development and a limited variety of low-impact commercial facilities which serve the needs of residents of surrounding residential communities. The commercial and office uses permitted are compatible with nearby residential areas. Development regulations are designed to ensure compatibility in size, scale, and landscaping with nearby residences.
CC
Community commercial
This district is intended for commercial facilities which serve the needs of markets ranging from several neighborhoods to the overall region. While allowed commercial and office uses are generally compatible with nearby residential areas, traffic and operating characteristics may have more negative effects on residential neighborhoods than those permitted in the LC district. CC districts are appropriate at major intersections, at the junction of several neighborhoods, or at substantial commercial subcenters.
DC
Downtown commercial
This district is intended to provide appropriate development regulations for downtown Centerville. Mixed uses are encouraged within the DC district. The grouping of uses is designed to strengthen the town center's role as a center for trade, service, and civic life.
GC
General commercial
This district accommodates a variety of commercial uses, some of which have significant traffic or visual effect. These districts may include commercial uses which are oriented to services, including automotive services, rather than retail activities. These uses may create land use conflicts with adjacent residential areas, requiring provision of adequate buffering. This district is most appropriately located along major arterial streets or in areas that can be adequately buffered from residential districts.
BP
Business park
This district is designed to promote the development of planned business parks that accommodate corporate offices, research facilities, and structures which can combine office, distribution, and limited industrial uses. These facilities serve a more regional audience, but may provide services to local residents. They are characterized by extensive landscaping, abundant parking facilities, and good visual and pedestrian relationships among buildings.
LI
Limited industrial
This district is intended to reserve sites appropriate for the location of industrial uses with relatively limited environmental effects. The district is designed to provide appropriate space and regulations to encourage good quality
Table 17.08A
Purposes of Zoning Districts (Cont.)
Symbol Title Purpose
342
industrial development, while assuring that facilities are served with adequate parking and loading facilities.
GI
General industrial
This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of industrial uses, some of which may have significant external effects. These uses may have operating characteristics that create conflicts with lower-intensity surrounding land uses. The district provides the reservation of land for these activities and includes buffering requirements to reduce incompatibility.

(2) Special instances may require that amateur radio tower heights exceed seventy-five feet to achieve effective and reliable communications. In such cases, the Commission may grant a conditional use permit to a licensed amateur radio operator for a specific tower height that exceeds seventy-five feet. In determining whether to grant such permission, the city council shall consider the federal guidelines contained in PRB-1 (Amateur Radio Preemption, 101 FCC 2d (1985); codified at C.F.R. Section 97.15(e).
(3) Such radio towers shall not be located within any front yard of the primary use.

In the instance that a planned unit development provides for creative or conservation subdivisions, the city may authorize such subdivisions to allow for greater flexibility in the design and development of subdivisions, in order to produce innovative residential environments, to provide for more efficient use of land, to protect topography and to encourage the preservation of common area and open space. These special regulations and design exceptions apply only to creative subdivisions.
387
(b) Site Area Per Unit. Unless otherwise provided, the site area per unit for a creative subdivision as a whole shall be that of the zoning district in which such subdivision is located. For the purpose of computing site area per unit, the area of public streets and private ways within the subdivision must be excluded. Residential use types may be combined within the creative subdivision provided that the subdivision as a whole complies with the required maximum density of the zoning district.
(c) Perimeter Yards.
(1) Structures must maintain normal street yard setbacks from any public streets that form the perimeter of the development.
(2) Structures must maintain a twenty-foot minimum side yard setback from any property line that forms the boundary of the development.
(d) Area and Yards for Individual Lots.
(1) Individual lots within a creative subdivision are exempt from minimum lot area or yard setback requirements set forth elsewhere in this title, unless provided for by the regulations for a specific zoning district. A creative subdivision must be planned and developed as a common development. A minimum separation of twenty feet shall be established for all residential structures not attached to one another, unless the city council grants a specific exception for developments proposing unique circumstances, only in as much as said development can be demonstrated to avoid detriment to Centerville's efforts to protect public health, safety, welfare, community character, property values and aesthetics.
(2) Any private garage oriented to or facing a public street or private way internal to the creative subdivision must be set back a minimum of twenty-five feet from that public street or private way.
(e) Coverage and Landscaping Requirements. Individual lots in a creative subdivision are exempt from maximum building and impervious coverage limitations and street yard landscaping requirements established for the zoning district. However, the subdivision as a whole, including streets, walks, and access ways, must comply with the building and impervious coverage regulations for its zoning district.

Chapter 17.32 – Nonconforming Uses
Sections:
17.32.010 - Purpose.
17.32.020 - Regulations additive.
17.32.030 - Residential districts.
17.32.040 - Nonresidential districts.
17.32.050 - Repair of nonconforming structures.
17.32.060 - Recognition of non-conformances.
17.32.010 - Purpose.
Within the various districts established by this title or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist a nonconforming use of land or structures. It is the intent of this title to permit such nonconforming use to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
17.32.020 - Regulations additive.
Regulations for nonconforming use of land are in addition to regulations for nonconforming use of structures. In the event of a conflict, the most restrictive regulation shall apply.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
17.32.030 - Residential districts.
(a) Nonconforming Use of Land. The lawful use of land upon which no building or structure is erected or constructed which becomes nonconforming under the terms of this title as adopted or amended may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title.
(2) No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel which was not occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title.
(3) If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which such land is located.
(b) Nonconforming Use of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not permitted by this title in the district in which it is located, except when required by law, shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located.
423
(2) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
(3) If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a similar nature within the same or a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
(4) In the event that a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a period of two years, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in which it is located. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
(5) Any structure devoted to a use made nonconforming by this title that is destroyed by any means to an extent of fifty percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, exclusive of the foundations, shall not be reconstructed and used as before such happening. If the structure be less than fifty percent destroyed above the foundation, it may be reconstructed and used as before, provided it be done within six months of such happening, and be built of like or similar materials.
(c) Nonconforming Structures. Where a structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title that could not be built under the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
(2) Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty percent or more of its replacement cost at time of destruction, exclusive of the foundations, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this title.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
17.32.040 - Nonresidential districts.
(a) Nonconforming Use of Land. The regulations described in Section 17.32.030 shall also apply to this section with the following exception:
(1) A structure devoted to a nonconforming use in a non-residential zoning district may be structurally altered or enlarged if the addition satisfies the following conditions:
(A) The enlargement or addition, when considered independently of the existing building, complies with all applicable setback, height, off-street parking, and landscaping requirements.
(B) The building, after the addition, conforms to height, off-street parking, and building and impervious surface coverages applicable to its zoning district.
(2) The construction is limited to buildings on land owned of record by the owner of the nonconforming use prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title.
(3) A lawful nonconforming use may be changed only to a use type permitted in a zoning district that is equal to or less intensive than that normally required for the previous use.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
17.32.050 - Repair of nonconforming structures.
424
(a) Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
(b) Except as provided in Section 17.32.030 (b)(5), a lawful nonconforming structure damaged by fire, explosion, storm or other calamity, except as may be restricted in the Floodplain Management Chapter (Chapter 15.36) of this code may be repaired and reconstructed provided there is no increase in the degree of nonconformity.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
17.32.060 - Recognition of non-conformances.
(a) Unauthorized Non-conformances. Any use of land or structure which was not an authorized nonconformity under any previous zoning ordinance or similar regulations shall not be authorized to continue its nonconforming status pursuant to this title.
(b) Nonconforming Uses and Conditional Use Permits. A lawful pre-existing use which would require a conditional use permit in its zoning district shall be presumed to have the appropriate permit and shall be considered a conforming use. The use shall be subject to the regulations governing lapses or revocation of permits, set forth in Chapter 17.34.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)

17.34.010 - Purpose.
This chapter establishes the methods for implementation of this title. These provisions include procedures for reviewing specific uses within certain zoning districts; amending this title; and granting variances.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
17.34.020 - Site plan review procedure.
(a) Purpose. The site plan review procedure is designed to assure that the design and location of commercial and industrial areas will be in conformance with the zoning standards of this title and are properly related to and in harmony with the existing and future business and industrial development of the city, including generally accepted principles of commercial, industrial and urban design. A detailed site plan shall be submitted showing the proposed use and development of all commercial and industrial sites for approval by the city council after review and recommendation by the Commission.
(b) Procedure.
(1) Whenever any person, firm, corporation or other group wishes to develop any tract, lot or parcel of land within the city or extra-territorial jurisdiction located in the multiple-family residential, urban corridor, limited commercial, downtown commercial, community commercial, general commercial, highway commercial, business park, limited industrial, or general industrial zoning districts, except for residential development of four units or less, the person, firm, corporation or other group shall cause to be prepared a site plan of such development and shall submit fifteen copies of said site plan to the zoning administrator. The provisions of this section shall also be applicable to the redevelopment, enlargement or extension of more than twenty-five percent of any commercial or industrial uses and structures existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title. The site plan shall contain such information and data as outlined herein.
(2) The zoning administrator shall review the site plan for compliance with this title and shall refer a copy of the site plan to the city engineer, or such other person as shall be designated from time to time by the city council, who shall review said site plan as to its compliance with other ordinances of the city, its effect upon public utilities and the public street system, and submit his findings as soon as possible to the Commission.
(3) The zoning administrator shall also forward a copy of the site plan to each member of the Commission. The Commission shall, after receiving the report of the engineer and the zoning administrator, review the site plan for conformity with the regulations and standards contained herein, and may confer with
426
the developer on changes deemed advisable in such site plan.
(4) The Commission shall forward its recommendation either for approval or disapproval of the site plan to the city council within forty-five days of the date of the submission of the site plan. If the commission does not act within forty-five days, the site plan shall be deemed to be approved by the commission unless the developer agrees to an extension of time.
(5) The Commission may, at its discretion, hold a public hearing on the site plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and to whom such notice shall be given.
(6) The city council shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of the Commission, either approve or disapprove the site plan of the proposed development.
(7) No building permit or certificate of zoning compliance for any structure within any district within which a site plan is required shall be issued until the site plan has been approved as provided herein.
(8) Upon final action by the Commission on any site plan, a copy of the site plan with the action of the Commission noted thereon and signed by the chairperson of the commission shall be filed with the city clerk.
(9) If the zoning administrator finds that any construction or proposed construction or occupancy of a development on a tract of land for which a site plan has been approved will not substantially comply with the site plan as approved, or if the zoning administrator finds that the construction and development of the tract is not being carried out in accordance with the development schedule filed with the site plan, the zoning administrator shall suspend all building permits for the development and order all construction stopped until such time as the owner of the project, or the owner's successors in interest, shall have provided the zoning administrator with proof satisfactory to the zoning administrator that the site plan will be complied with. The zoning administrator shall not issue a certificate of zoning compliance for any structure within the development while the building permit for the development has been suspended pursuant to this subsection. Any person aggrieved by any decision or action of the zoning administrator under this subsection may appeal such action or decision to the zoning board of adjustment.
(10) If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a site plan has been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or that a modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate or more practicable development of the site, he may apply for an amendment of the site plan. The Commission may grant an extension of time or a modification of a previously approved site plan if it determines that such modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate development of the site.
(c) Review. In reviewing a proposed site plan, the city council and the Commission shall consider the location of the buildings on the site with respect to vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and from the buildings, traffic between the site and abutting streets, suitable layout and adequate provisions for off-street parking and loading, with due consideration given to the provision of traffic islands, pedestrian ways and landscaping within the parking area, provision for necessary screening between adjacent properties and the site, location and display of traffic signs to promote traffic patterns, location and display of business signs so as not to distract or confuse motorists and location and display of outdoor advertising so as to provide adequate visibility within the site during hours of night operation but not to have adverse effects on surrounding properties.
(d) General Requirements. All site plans shall be drawn at a scale not less than one inch equals fifty feet. Ten copies of the site plan shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. The purpose of the site plan is to show all information needed to enable the zoning administrator, city engineer, Commission and the city council to determine if the proposed development meets the requirements of this title.
(e) Required Information. The site plan required shall include the following information concerning the proposed
427
development:
(1) Names of all persons having an interest in the property, legal description of property, point of compass, scale and date.
(2) Applicant's name, planned land use and present zoning.
(3) If the applicant is other than the legal owner, the applicant's interest shall be stated.
(4) Name and address of a person who prepared the site plan along with certification by a licensed engineer or architect responsible for preparation of the plan.
(f) Required Illustrations. The site plan shall clearly set forth the following information concerning the proposed development:
(1) Property boundary lines, dimensions and total area of the proposed development.
(2) Contour lines of the proposed development at intervals of not more than two feet. If substantial topographic change is proposed, the existing topography of the development and of the surrounding area shall be illustrated on a separate map, and the proposed finished topography shown on the site plan.
(3) The availability, location, size and capacity of existing utilities, and of proposed utilities.
(4) The proposed location, size, height, shape, use and architectural theme of all buildings or structures, including signs, in the proposed development.

(8) Open spaces, yards, recreational areas, walkways, driveways, outside lighting, walls, fences, monuments, statues, signs and other manmade features to be used in the landscape of the proposed development.
(9) Facilities for the collection and disposal of garbage and trash.
(10) Location and type of all plants, grass and trees to be used in the landscape of the proposed development. Landscaping to be used for screening purposes shall be illustrated in elevation as well as plan, with the approximate size and name of plants, shrubs or trees to be planted clearly indicated.
(11) Location of entrances and exits from the proposed development onto public streets, and interior drives and proposed sidewalks in the development.
(12) Proposed drainage facilities and provisions for flood control, if applicable.
(13) The location, height and area of all signs (directional signs, identification signs, or temporary signs) in the proposed development.
(g) Approval and Expiration. All site plan approvals shall expire and terminate one hundred eighty days after the
428
date of council approval unless a building permit has been issued for the construction provided for in the site plan. The city council may, upon written request by the developer, extend the time for the issuance of a building permit for sixty days. In the event the building permit for the construction provided for in a site plan expires or is canceled, then such site plan approval shall thereupon terminate.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
17.34.030 - Conditional use permits.
(a) Purpose. The conditional use permit procedure provides for zoning board of adjustment review and approval of uses within zoning districts which have unusual site development or operating characteristics that could adversely affect surrounding properties.
(b) Administration. The zoning board of adjustment shall review, evaluate, and act upon all applications submitted pursuant to this procedure. The zoning board of adjustment, following proper notice, shall hold a public hearing, on each conditional use permit application and, following such public hearing, shall act on the application. Before approval of any conditional use permit, the board shall review the conformity of the proposal with the criteria set forth in Table 17.34A. The board may approve or disapprove the conditional permit as submitted or, before approval, may require that the applicant modify, alter, adjust, or amend the proposal as the board deems necessary to the end that it preserve the intent and purpose of this title to promote public health, safety and the general welfare.
(c) Application Requirements. An application for a conditional use permit may be filed with the zoning administrator by the owners(s) of a property or the agent of owner. Applications for a conditional use permit under the terms of this section shall be accompanied by evidence concerning the feasibility of the proposed request and its effect on surrounding property and shall include a detailed site plan containing all requirements for site plan review set forth under Section 17.34.020(e) and (f).
(d) Criteria for Review. The board shall review and act upon the request based on the criteria established in Table 17.34A and conformance with applicable regulations in this title.
(e) Scope of Approval.
(1) The zoning board of adjustment may, at its discretion, apply a conditional use permit to a specific owner or applicant. The board may establish special site development or operational regulations as a condition of approval of a conditional use permit.
(2) The zoning board of adjustment shall not grant a conditional use permit for any home occupation/home-based business, which is otherwise prohibited under Section 17.22.110.
(f) Change in Approved Special Permits. In the event a conditional permit is granted under the terms of this section, any change thereafter in the approved use or site plan shall be resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original proposal.
(g) Lapse and Revocation of Permit.
(1) A conditional use permit shall become void two years after its effective date if the commencement of construction of the improvements covered by such conditional use permit has not occurred during that period, or sooner if so conditioned by the zoning board of adjustment.
(2) The zoning board of adjustment may revoke a conditional use permit should the operation of the use subject to such permit violate the conditions under which the permit was granted.
(h) Previously Approved Permits. Any conditional use approved under regulations in effect before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall be considered to have a valid conditional use permit, subject to requirements imposed at the time of its approval.
429
(i) Appeals. Actions taken by the zoning board of adjustment subject to this section may be appealed as provided for in Section 17.34.100.
(Ord. 1332 § 1, May 20, 2019)
