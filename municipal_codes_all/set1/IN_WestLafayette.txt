PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of West Lafayette, Indiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Prior Code, as supplemented through December 5, 2016, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Prior Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Amanda Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Eric H. Burns, Corporation Counsel, and Mr. Elliott L. McKinnis, Attorney at Law, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-23. - Composition; nomination and election of councilmembers. 
    The council of the city has nine members. The city is divided into six council districts. Three councilmembers, designated as "at-large," are nominated by each party. The entire electorate votes on these at-large councilmembers, with the three receiving the most votes being elected. The remaining six councilmembers are elected by districts and by only the voters of that district. Each voter in a city election therefore votes for one councilmember from the voter's district and three councilmembers at-large.

Sec. 10-21. - Area boundary map. 
    The MS4 area boundary map of the city is as follows: 

(Prior Code, ch. 116, app. B; Ord. No. 27-11; Ord. No. 34-12, app. B) 
Sec. 10-22. - Drainage Code adopted; governs stormwater runoff, erosion and sediment control; background. 
(a)  The common council of the city, on February 6, 1989, adopted Ordinance No. 43-88 which established "The City of West Lafayette Drainage Code," in order to govern the control of runoff of stormwater and to protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of the land in the city and its water resources. This Code was primarily targeted at stormwater discharge quantity, and erosion and sediment control. 
(b)  On December 8, 1999, Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program was published in the Federal Register. The NPDES program, as authorized by the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act, controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the United States. Phase II of NPDES requires permit coverage for stormwater discharges from regulated small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) and for small construction activity that results in the disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre. This federal regulation went into effect March 10, 2003. In response to Phase II of NPDES, the state department of environmental management enacted rule 13 (327 IAC 15-13) and revised Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5). 
(c)  Under these new state and federal regulations, the city is required to establish a regulatory mechanism for stormwater quality management. Therefore, the "City of West Lafayette Drainage Code" was expanded to include stormwater quality in addition to quantity. 
(Prior Code, § 116.102; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-23. - Findings. 
    The city finds that: 
(1)  Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within and downstream of the city are at times subjected to flooding; 
(2)  Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the region; 
(3)  Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and deposition; 
(4)  Soil erosion resulting from land-disturbing activities causes a significant amount of sediment and other pollutants to be transported off-site and deposited in ditches, streams, wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs; 
(5)  Increases of stormwater runoff rates, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution have occurred as a result of land development, and have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the city; 
(6)  Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the city will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely affect the city's water bodies and water resources; 
(7)  Illicit discharges have occurred as a result of illegal dumping and direct connections of non-stormwater flows, and have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the city; 
(8)  Continued pollutant contributions from illicit discharges within the city will, absent reasonable regulation, monitoring, and enforcement, adversely affect the city's water bodies and water resources; 
(9)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, non-point source pollution, and illicit sources of pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater management; 
(10)  Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained and referenced in this Code and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff and illicit discharges; 
(11)  Adopting this Code is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare, and for the conservation of our natural resources. 
(Prior Code, § 116.103; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-24. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Code is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system; to enhance economic objectives; and to protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water resources within the city. This Code establishes methods for managing the quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the storm drain system in order to comply with state and federal requirements. The objectives of this Code are: 
(1)  To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused by excessive stormwater runoff. 
(2)  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system from active construction site runoff. 
(3)  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system from runoff from new development and re-development. 
(4)  To prohibit discharges of non-stormwater flow into the storm drain system. 
(5)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this Code.

Sec. 10-87. - Storage of hazardous or toxic material. 
    Storage or stockpiling of hazardous or toxic material within any drainageway, or in its associated floodway or floodplain, is strictly prohibited. Storage or stockpiling of hazardous or toxic material on active construction sites must include adequate protection and/or containment so as to prevent any such materials from entering any temporary or permanent stormwater conveyance or drainageway. 
(Prior Code, § 116.204; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-88. - Private property maintenance duties. 
    Every person owning property through which a drainageway passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the drainageway located within their property boundaries, free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.

Sec. 10-89. - Spill reporting. 
(a)  Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a water body any substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall immediately inform the county health department and county emergency management agency concerning the discharge. A written report concerning the discharge shall be filed with the city engineer, by the discharger, within five days. The written report shall specify: 
(1)  The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof; 
(2)  The exact date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge; 
(3)  All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge, and all measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence; 
(4)  The name and telephone number of the person making the report, and the name of a person who may be contacted for additional information on the matter. 
(b)  A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative defense to a civil infraction proceeding, for a first offence only, brought under this Code against a discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be a defense to a legal action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or to obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A discharge shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger complies with all the requirements of this section. 
(Prior Code, § 116.206; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-90. - Inspections and monitoring. 
(a)  Storm drainage system. The city will periodically inspect the portion of the storm drainage system under the city's control, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit connections and discharges into the system. This inspection will include a screening of discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to determine if prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage system. It could also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm drainage system itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the system by means other than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated sheet runoff. 
(b)  Potential polluters. If, as a result of a storm drainage system inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit discharge, the city may inspect and/or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater runoff facilities of the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the requirements of this Code. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the city's properly identified representative to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or sampling. The city, or its properly identified representative, may place on the discharger's property, the equipment or devices used for such sampling or inspection. Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to enforcement action as described in division 3 of this article. 
(c)  New development and re-development. Following approval of final stormwater plans by the city, new development and re-development sites shall be inspected by the city's properly-identified representative. This inspection will be to ensure all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm drainage system are in compliance with this article.

Secs. 10-91-10-108. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 4. - STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 10-109. - Applicability and exemptions. 
    The storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all new business, commercial and industrial developments, residential subdivisions, planned developments, rural estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or other new construction located within the city. Possible exceptions to the requirement are minor subdivisions and parcelization as described in the unified subdivision ordinance. The city engineer, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and parcelization. Additional exemptions regarding the detention requirements are provided under section 10-110(a)(6). 
(Prior Code, § 116.301; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-110. - Policy on stormwater quantity management. 
(a)  Detention policy. It is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the city do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, except for situations provided in subsections (a)(6) and (7) of this section, the storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all developments and redevelopments located within the city. 
(1)  General release rates. In general, the post-developed release rates from development sites shall be no greater than the general release rates provided in Table 3-1. For sites where the pre-developed area has more than one outlet, the release rates should be computed based on pre-developed discharge to each outlet point. 
TABLE 3-1 
General Release Rates (cfs/acre) Based on Pre-Developed Condition Curve Number at Each Outlet Point Curve Number 10-Year 100-Year < 65 0.07 0.23 66 - 69 0.13 0.33 70 - 73 0.20 0.43 74 - 77 0.27 0.53 78 - 81 0.34 0.63 82 - 85 0.44 0.75 > 86 0.55 0.87  
(2)  Depressional storage. For sites where depressional storage exists, the general release rates provided above may have to be further reduced. If depressional storage exists at the site, site-specific release rates must be calculated according to methodologies described in the "Stormwater Technical Standards Manual" ("technical standards"), accounting for the depressional storage by modeling it as a pond whose outlet is a weir at an elevation such that stormwater can currently overflow the depressional storage area. Post developed release rates for sites with depressional storage shall be the two-year pre-developed peak runoff rate for the post-developed ten-year storm and the ten-year pre-developed peak runoff rate for the post-developed 100-year storm. In no case shall the calculated site-specific release rates be larger than the general rates provided above. 
(3)  Determination and preservation of storage. Also, it should be noted that for determining the post-developed peak runoff rates, the depressional storage must be assumed to be filled unless the city engineer can be assured that the noted storage will be preserved in perpetuity. 
(4)  Detention/retention facility; on-site/off-site runoff. 
a.  Runoff from all upstream tributary areas (off-site land areas) may be bypassed around the detention/retention facility without attenuation. Such runoff may also be routed through the detention/retention facility, provided that a separate outlet system or channel is incorporated for the safe passage of such flows (i.e., not through the primary outlet of a detention facility). Unless the pond is being designed as a regional detention facility, the primary outlet structure shall be sized and the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir determined according to the on-site runoff only. Once the size and location of the primary outlet structure as well as the invert elevation of the emergency overflow weir is determined by considering on-site runoff, the 100-year pond elevation is determined by routing the entire inflow, on-site and off-site, through the pond. 
b.  Note that the efficiency of the detention/retention facility in controlling the on-site runoff may be severely affected if the off-site area is considerably larger than the on-site area. As a general guidance, on-line detention may not be effective in controlling on-site runoff where the ratio of off-site area to on-site area is larger than 5:1. Additional detention (above and beyond that required for on-site area) may be required by the city when the ratio of off-site area to on-site area is larger than 5:1. 
(5)  Downstream restrictions. 
a.  In the event the downstream receiving channel or storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the post-developed release rate provided above, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system. Additional detention, as determined by the city, shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or waterways. 
b.  If the proposed development makes up only a portion of the undeveloped watershed upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable release rate for the development shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the restriction. 
c.  In accordance with section 10-217, the allowable release rates may be further reduced by the city if on-site or off-site conditions warrant the reduction. 
(6)  Exemptions for detention requirements. Detention may not be required for the following: 
a.  Land alterations where the primary basis on which a stormwater drainage permit is required is the construction, enlargement, or location (on a permanent foundation) of a one-family dwelling, two-family dwelling, or accessory structure appurtenant to either a one- or two-family dwelling. 
b.  Approved fill areas or one-time additions to existing commercial buildings (including multi-family residential structures) that do not increase the amount of impervious area on-site by more than a total of 0.5 acres, provided the existing runoff patterns and flow capacity of the property will not be altered by the work. 
c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(5) of this section, those site developments where the stormwater management system has been designed such that: 
1.  After combining flows from both the off-site and on-site drainage areas, there will be no increase in the total peak discharge from the developed site during the two-, ten-, or 100-year storm events; 
2.  The volume of runoff for each project site outlet has not been increased for the entire range of storm events, up to and including the 100-year storm event; and 
3.  The flow width is greater than or equal to that flow width which existed prior to the development (for the entire range of storm events, up to and including the 100-year storm event) and the velocity at the property boundary line for each sub-basin is less than or equal to that velocity which existed prior to the development (for the entire range of storm events, up to and including the 100-year storm event). 
d.  Where the direct release of runoff from the proposed development meets the conditions set forth in subsection (a)(7) of this section. 
(7)  Direct release provisions. 
a.  It is the policy of the city to allow the direct release (no detention) of runoff from a proposed development to an adjacent stream with more than 100 square miles of contributing drainage area at the direct release point. Therefore, direct release may be allowed for parcels adjacent to the following stream reaches in the city: Wabash River-The entire reach within the county. 
b.  Due to unknowns regarding the future development patterns and the associated proposed stormwater management systems within a watershed, it is the policy of the city to discourage direct release to a stream with less than 100 square miles of contributing drainage area at the direct release point. However, in rare circumstances, where a comprehensive watershed-wide hydrologic study or watershed plan of a major stream adopted by the city substantiates the benefits of (or allows for) direct release for a proposed development located adjacent to a major stream, the detention requirements set in subsection (a)(7)a of this section may be waived. 
c.  In substantiating the potential benefits of direct release, the watershed-wide hydrologic study provided by the applicant must demonstrate that the peak discharge associated with two-year, ten-year, and 100-year precipitation events would not increase along the receiving stream. At a minimum, the stream reach to be examined needs to extend from the direct release point to a point downstream with a drainage area at least ten times the drainage area of the proposed development and its off-site contributing drainage area. The required analyses must be done both for the existing land use and future potential land use (developed conditions) in the watersheds involved. 
d.  To be applicable to the development site, the sub-basin sizes for the watershed-wide hydrologic analyses of the major stream (including the sub-basin area containing the proposed development and its off-site contributing areas) must be generally uniform (between 0.5 and 2.0 times the average sub-basin size). Furthermore, the maximum size of the sub-basin area containing the proposed development and its off-site contributing areas should not exceed 5.0 times the area of the proposed development. 
(b)  Grading and building pad elevation policy. 
(1)  In addition to all floodplain requirements noted in the local zoning ordinance, flood protection grade (FPG) applicable to all buildings located within special flood hazard area (SFHA) or regulated adjacent areas (if applicable and if such buildings are allowed under the local zoning ordinance) shall be shown on the final plat. 
(2)  For all structures located outside Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) designated floodplains that are subject to flooding from an open ditch, the lowest adjacent grade (LAG) of all residential, commercial or industrial buildings shall have a minimum of two feet of freeboard above the 100-year flood elevation. 
(3)  For all structures fronting a flooding source other than a swale or an emergency flood route, the floor of any basements or crawl spaces (if provided) shall be a minimum of one foot above the normal pool level (if pond) or the two-year flood level (if a stream or an open ditch). In addition, special considerations, based on detailed geotechnical analyses, should be made prior to considering placement of any basement below the 100-year flood elevation of an adjacent flooding source or pond. 
(4)  For all structures located outside FEMA or IDNR designated floodplains that are subject to flooding from a detention/retention pond, the LAG of all residential, commercial or industrial buildings shall have a minimum of two feet of freeboard above the 100-year flood elevation or the emergency overflow weir elevation, whichever is higher. 
(5)  For all structures, the building's lowest entry elevation shall be constructed such that drainage is not directed against the building and shall be in accordance with applicable local building codes. There shall be a positive slope drainage away from the builing with maximum yard slopes that are 3:1 where soil has been disturbed during construction processes. 
(6)  Overflow paths throughout the development resulting from a 100-year storm event shall be determined, clearly shown on the plans, and contained in permanent drainage easements along the centerline of the flow path. No fences or landscaping shall be constructed within the easement areas that may impede the free flow of stormwater. For all structures adjacent to a overflow path, the minimum adjacent grade of the portion of the structure (the ground elevation next to the building after construction is completed that sits adjacent to the overflow path or may be subject to flooding by the overflow path) shall be a minimum of one foot above the estimated 100-year elevation of the overflow path using methodologies described in the "technical standards." 
(7)  In addition to the policies described in this section, potential flooding that would impact the site due to the minimum overtopping elevation of adjacent roads shall be considered. 
(8)  It shall be the property owner's responsibility to maintain the natural features on their lots and to take preventive measures against any and all erosion and/or deterioration of natural or manmade features on their lots. 
(c)  Adjoining property impacts policy. 
(1)  Design and construction of the stormwater facility shall provide for the discharge of the stormwater runoff from off-site land areas as well as the stormwater from the area being developed (on-site land areas) to an acceptable outlet (as determined by the city engineer) having capacity to receive upstream (off-site) and on-site drainage. The flow path from the development outfall to a regulated drain or natural waterway (as determined by the city engineer) shall be provided on an exhibit that includes topographic information. Any existing field tile encountered during the construction shall also be incorporated into the proposed stormwater drainage system or tied to an acceptable outlet. In addition, no activities conducted as part of the development shall be allowed to obstruct the free flow of floodwaters from an upstream property. 
(2)  Where the outfall from a stormwater drainage system of any developer flows through real estate not owned by the developer prior to reaching a regulated drain or natural waterway (as determined by the city engineer), no approval shall be granted for the stormwater drainage system until all owners of real estate crossed by the outfall either consent in writing to the use of their real estate or are notified in writing of a hearing before the city board of public works and safety with respect to the proposed use. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be made by: 1) mailing a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested to such person's residence, place of business or employment with return receipt requested and returned showing receipt of such notice; 2) delivering a copy of such notice to the owner; and/or such tenant personally. Such notice shall be personally delivered or mailed not less than seven, nor more than 14 days prior to the hearing. Proof of delivery of notice to each landowner shall be filed by affidavit with the city engineer prior to the hearing. 
(3)  If an adequate outlet is not located on site, then off-site drainage improvements may be required. Those improvements may include, but are not limited to: extending storm sewers, clearing, dredging and/or removal of obstructions to open drains or natural water courses, and the removal or replacement of undersized culvert pipes as required by the city engineer. 
(d)  No net loss floodplain storage policy. 
(1)  Floodplains exist adjacent to all natural and manmade streams, regardless of contributing drainage area or whether they have been previously identified or mapped. Due to potential impacts of floodplain loss on peak flows in streams and on the environment, disturbance to floodplains should be avoided. When the avoidance of floodplain disturbance is not practical, the natural functions of floodplain should be preserved to the extent possible. 
(2)  In an attempt to strike a balance between the legitimate need for economic development within the city and the need to preserve the natural functions of floodplains to the extent possible, compensatory excavation equivalent to the floodplain storage lost shall be required for all activities within floodplain of streams located in the city where drainage area of the stream is equal or larger than one square mile. This requirement shall be considered to be above and beyond the minimum requirements provided in the unified zoning ordinance in the city. 
(3)  Computations must show no net loss of floodplain storage for ten-year, 50-year, and 100-year storm events. That is, the post-development ten-year floodplain storage along a stream shall be the same as the ten-year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream within the property limits or at a location approved by the city. The post-development 50-year floodplain storage along a stream shall be the same as the 50-year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream within the property limits or at a location approved by the city, and the post-development 100-year floodplain storage along the stream shall be the same as the 100-year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream within the property limits or at a location approved by the city.

(Prior Code, § 116.303; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-112. - Placement of utilities. 
    No utility company may disturb existing storm drainage facilities without the consent of the city engineer, whose decision may be appealed to the city board of public works and safety. All existing drainage facilities shall have senior rights and damage to the facilities shall result in penalties as prescribed in division 2 of this article. 
(Prior Code, § 116.304; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-113. - Structures near county-regulated drains. 
    For regulated drains not located in platted subdivisions, unless otherwise approved by the county drainage board, no permanent structure (including fences) shall be erected within the legal drain easement, as determined by the county drainage board. 
(Prior Code, § 116.305; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-114. - Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting. 
(a)  After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the city engineer and the commencement of construction activities, the city engineer has the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this article, the "technical standards," and the terms and conditions of the approved permit. 
(b)  Long-term inspection and maintenance of stormwater quantity facilities shall be the responsibility of the city. All public and privately owned stormwater quantity facilities will be inspected no less than once each year. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available storage capacity and the operational condition of key facility elements. Stormwater quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved stormwater management permit, and shall not be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except in accordance with the approved stormwater permit, or in accordance with approved amendments or revisions to the permit. If deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will be required to take all necessary measures to correct such deficiencies within 180 days. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the allowed time period, the city will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if necessary. 
(c)  Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body, and determined before the final stormwater permit is approved. Stormwater detention/retention basins may be donated to the city or other unit of government designated by the city, for ownership and permanent maintenance only if the city or the other governmental unit has expressly accepted responsibility. 
(Prior Code, § 116.306; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-115. - Location of existing sanitary sewer laterals of buildings to be wrecked; inspection, special sealing permit required. 
    All existing sanitary sewer laterals to buildings being wrecked or demolished shall be located by the demolition contractor and properly sealed off two feet behind the street right-of-way line. This work shall be done in accordance with requirements of and shall be inspected by the wastewater department. A special sewer sealing permit will be required for the wrecking of buildings that have or are likely to have sanitary sewer laterals. There shall be a sanitary sewer sealing permit fee as established by the city.

DIVISION 5. - STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES 

Sec. 10-142. - Applicability and exemptions. 
(a)  The city will require a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures and materials handling procedures, to be submitted as part of the construction plans and specifications. Any project located within the city that includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land-disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of one-half acre or more of total land area, is subject to the requirements of this article. This includes both new development and re-development. This article also applies to disturbances of less than one-half acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one-half or more acres of land, within the MS4 area. Section 10-144 provides guidelines for calculating land disturbance. 
(b)  The requirements under this article do not apply to the following activities: 
(1)  Agricultural land-disturbing activities; or 
(2)  Forest harvesting activities. 
(c)  The requirements under this article do not apply to the following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures: 
(1)  Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under 329 IAC 10. 
(2)  Coal mining activities permitted under IC art. 14-34. 
(3)  Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant to a permit issued by the state department of environmental management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary. 
(d)  For an individual lot where land disturbance is expected to be one-half acre or more, the individual lot owner must complete their own notice of intent letter, apply for a stormwater permit from the city, and ensure that a sufficient construction and stormwater pollution prevention plan is completed and submitted in accordance with division 7 of this article, regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted project site. 
(e)  An individual lot with land disturbance less than one-half acre, located within a larger permitted project site, is considered part of the larger permitted project site, and the individual lot operator must comply with the terms and conditions of the stormwater permit approved for the larger project site. The stormwater permit application for the larger project site must include detailed erosion and sediment control measures for individual lots. These individual lots are not required to submit their own stormwater permit application, but must obtain a stormwater review approval prior to receiving a building permit. Details of the permitting process are contained in division 7 of this article. 
(f)  It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is completed and submitted to the city engineer in accordance with division 7 of this article. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure compliance with this Code during the construction activity and implementation of the construction plan, until the city receives and approves a notice of termination. However, all persons engaging in construction and land-disturbing activities on a permitted project site meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this article and this Code and the approved permit and plan. 
(Prior Code, § 116.401; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-143. - Policy on stormwater pollution prevention. 
    Effective stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is dependent on a combination of preventing movement of soil from its original position (erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a waterbody (sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling. The developer must submit to the city, a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) with detailed erosion and sediment control plans as well as a narrative describing materials handling and storage, and construction sequencing. The following principles apply to all land-disturbing activities and should be considered in the preparation of a SWPPP within the city. 
(1)  Minimize the potential for soil erosion by designing a development that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and fills in areas with steep slopes should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
(2)  Existing natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent (within 35 feet of top of bank) to watercourses and lakes also should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Unvegetated areas or vegetated areas with less than 70 percent cover that are scheduled or likely to be left inactive for 15 days or more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized with measures appropriate for the season to reduce erosion potential. Alternative measures to site stabilization may be acceptable if the project site owner or their representative can demonstrate they have implemented and maintained erosion and sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge from the inactive area. 
(3)  All activities on a site should be conducted in a logical sequence so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the shortest practical period of time during development. 
(4)  The length and steepness of designed slopes should be minimized to reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be designed and adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant velocities will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet. Methods for determining acceptable velocities are included in the "City Stormwater Technical Standards." 
(5)  Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the project site shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures appropriate to minimize sedimentation. A stable construction site access shall be provided at all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to the project site. 
(6)  Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent wastes or unused building materials, including garbage, debris, packaging material, fuels and petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes, cleaning wastes, wastewater, concrete truck washout, and other substances from being carried from a project site by runoff or wind. Identification of areas where concrete truck washout is permissible must be clearly posted at appropriate areas of the site. Wastes and unused building materials shall be managed and disposed of in accordance with all applicable state statutes and regulations. Proper storage and handling of materials such as fuels or hazardous wastes, and spill prevention and cleanup measures shall be implemented to minimize the potential for pollutants to contaminate surface water or groundwater or degrade soil quality. 
(7)  Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of accumulated sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of accumulated sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared sediment shall be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in accordance with all applicable statutes and regulations. 
(8)  Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either discharged directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel, or diffused and released to adjacent property without causing an erosion or pollutant problem to the adjacent property owner. 
(9)  Natural features, including wetlands, shall be protected from pollutants associated with stormwater runoff. 
(10)  The SWPPP shall designate a paved or stoned area for parking during construction to prevent site disturbance and the permittee shall require all contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and deliveries to use only the designated parking area. 
(Prior Code, § 116.402; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-144. - Calculations, design standards and specifications. 
    In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of determining applicability of this article to the project, the following guidelines shall be used: 
(1)  Off-site construction activities that provide services (e.g., road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to a land-disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the control of the project site owner. 
(2)  Strip developments will be considered as one project site and must comply with this article unless the total combined disturbance on all individual lots is less than one-half acre and is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale. 
(3)  To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this rule, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as determined by the following: 
a.  For a single-family residential project site where the lots are one-half acre or more, one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance. 
b.  For a single-family residential project site where the lots are less than one-half acre in size, the total lot must be calculated as being disturbed. 
c.  To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of projects sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a minimum of one-half acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance, unless the lots are less than one-half acre in size, in which case the total lot must be calculated as being disturbed. 
The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction sites shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the "Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual" or the "technical standards." The methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the policy stated in section 10-143 and meet the requirements of IDEM's Rule 5. 
(Prior Code, § 116.403; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-145. - Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting. 
(a)  Following approval of the stormwater management permit by the city and commencement of construction activities, the city engineer has the authority to conduct inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this article, the "Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual," and the terms and conditions of the approved permit. 
(b)  A self-monitoring program must be implemented by the project site owner to ensure the stormwater pollution prevention plan is working effectively. A trained individual, as defined in the technical standards, shall perform a written evaluation of the project site by the end of the next business day following each measurable storm event. If there are no measurable storm events within a given week, the site should be monitored at least once in that week. Weekly inspections shall continue until the entire site has been stabilized and a notice of termination has been issued. The inspector should look at the maintenance of existing stormwater pollution prevention measures, including erosion and sediment control measures, drainage structures, and construction materials storage/containment facilities, to ensure they are functioning properly. The inspector shall also identify additional measures, beyond those originally identified in the stormwater pollution prevention plan, necessary to remain in compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations. 
(c)  The resulting evaluation reports must include the name of the individual performing the evaluation, the date of the evaluation, problems identified at the project site, and details of maintenance, additional measures, and corrective actions recommended and completed. A form for documenting these inspections can be found in appendix B of the technical standard. 
(d)  The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as a guideline for stormwater quality, but should not be interpreted to be the only basis for implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project site. The project site owner is responsible for implementing, in accordance with this article, all measures necessary to adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff. Recommendations by the inspector for modified stormwater quality measures should be implemented. 
(e)  Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be submitted to the city engineer, the city engineer has the right to request complete records of maintenance and monitoring activities involving stormwater pollution prevention measures. All evaluation reports for the project site must be made available to the city engineer, in an organized fashion, within 48 hours of a request.

DIVISION 6. - STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST CONSTRUCTION 

Sec. 10-174. - Applicability and exemptions. 
(a)  In addition to the requirements of division 5 of this article, the stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to the city engineer as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place following completion of construction activities to continuously filter stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the city that includes clearing, grading, excavation, and other land-disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of one-half acre or more of total land area, is subject to the requirements of this article. This includes both new development and re-development, and disturbances of less than one-half acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one-half or more acres of land, within the MS4 area. 
(b)  The requirements under this article do not apply to the following activities: 
(1)  Agricultural land-disturbing activities; 
(2)  Forest harvesting activities; 
(3)  Construction activities associated with a single-family residential dwelling disturbing less than five acres, when the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale; 
(4)  Single-family residential developments consisting of four or less lots; 
(5)  A single-family residential strip development where the developer offers for sale or lease without land improvements and the project is not part of a larger common plan of development of sale; or 
(6)  Individual building lots within a larger permitted project. 
(c)  The requirements under this article do not apply to the following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures: 
(1)  Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under 329 IAC 10. 
(2)  Coal mining activities permitted under IC art. 14-34. 
(3)  Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant to a permit issued by the state department of environmental management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary. 
(d)  It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is completed and submitted to the city engineer in accordance with division 7 of this article. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to ensure proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs in compliance with this Code and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to notify the city engineer with a sufficient notice of termination upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site. However, all eventual property owners of stormwater quality facilities meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this article and this Code. 
(Prior Code, § 116.501; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-175. - Policy on stormwater quality management. 
(a)  It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates, increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new development and re-development continues in the city, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers in order to preserve fishable and swimmable conditions. Through the use of Best Management Practices (BMP), stormwater runoff will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients and contaminants will be removed. 
(b)  The project site owner must submit to the city engineer a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) which shows placement of appropriate BMP from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the "Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual" or the "technical standards." The noted BMPs must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or referenced in the "Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual" or the "technical standards." Practices other than those specified in the pre-approved list may be utilized. However, the burden of proof as to whether the performance and ease of maintenance of such practices will be according to guidelines provided in the "Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual" or the "technical standards," shall be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of approval of such BMPs are provided in the "technical standards." 
(c)  Requirements of this Code and the "technical standards" with regard to post-construction stormwater quality management can be satisfied through a variety of methods broadly categorized under two general approaches: 
(1)  Conventional approach. 
(2)  Low impact development (LID) approach. 
(d)  The site developer and designer are encouraged to review the LID discussion in the technical standards prior to site design. 
(e)  Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install appropriate practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new facilities and existing facilities that replace their tanks. 
(Prior Code, § 116.502; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-176. - Calculations, design standards and specifications. 
(a)  Calculation of land disturbance shall follow the guidelines discussed in section 10-144. 
(b)  The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the "Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual" or the "Technical Standards." The methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the policy stated in section 10-175 and meet the requirements of IDEM's Rule 13. 
(Prior Code, § 116.503; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-177. - Easement requirements. 
    All stormwater quality management systems, including detention or retention basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems, conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements or included in a master covenant and agreement. 
(Prior Code, § 116.504; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-178. - Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting. 
(a)  After the approval of the stormwater management permit by the city and the commencement of construction activities, the city engineer has the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this article, the Technical Standards or "Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual" and the terms and conditions of the approved permit. The inspections will cover physical conditions, available water quality volume capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements. 
(b)  Stormwater quality facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in accordance with the "Operation and Maintenance Manual." This manual shall not be subsequently altered, revised or replaced except in accordance with the approved stormwater permit, or in accordance with approved amendments or revisions in the permit. Following completion of construction and formal acceptance, inspection and maintenance of publicly owned stormwater quality facilities shall be the responsibility of the city. Inspection and maintenance of privately owned stormwater quality facilities shall be the responsibility of the owner. 
(c)  All stormwater quality facilities will be inspected by representatives of the project site owner until the project is complete and a notice of termination has been approved. Inspection frequency shall follow specifications included in the "Operation and Maintenance Manual" submitted as part of the permit application. Optional inspection checklists for some of the more common BMPs can be found in appendix B of the technical standards. Following project completion, the owner is responsible for inspection and maintenance of the stormwater quality facilities. The city has the authority to conduct inspections following project completion to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this article. Noted deficiencies and recommended corrective action will be included in an inspection report. If deficiencies are found during the inspection, the owner of the stormwater quality facility will be notified by the city engineer and will be required to take all necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the city will undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if necessary.

DIVISION 7. - PERMITS 

Sec. 10-210. - Preliminary drainage approvals. 
    In order to gain an understanding of the drainage requirements for a specific project, a developer may submit preliminary drainage plans and calculations, certified by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed land surveyor registered in the state, for review by the city engineer. A preliminary drainage approval may be obtained prior to preliminary plat approval for subdivisions. The direction provided by the city engineer during such a review is based on preliminary data and shall not be construed as an approval or binding on either party. The following is a general listing of minimum data requirements for the review of preliminary drainage plans: 
(1)  Two complete sets of plans. 
(2)  Drainage narrative. 
(3)  Watershed boundaries with USGS contours or best information possible. 
(4)  Existing regulated drains. 
(5)  Drainage calculations to support narrative: 
a.  Existing and proposed runoff. 
b.  Existing and proposed curve number. 
c.  Existing and proposed time of concentration. 
d.  Upstream and downstream restrictions. 
(6)  Proof of notification for obtaining any needed consents, off-site easements, or right-of-way, if required. 
(7)  Topographic map of the project with layout. 
(8)  A copy of the foregoing information in digital format acceptable to the city engineer. 
(Prior Code, § 116.601; Ord. No. 27-11) 
Sec. 10-211. - Permit procedures. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all development or re-development of land. Individual lots in residential subdivisions with land disturbance less than one-half acre, which are developed within a larger permitted project site, should refer to section 10-213 for plan review requirements and procedures. 
(b)  Within unincorporated areas of the county. 
(1)  For projects located within unincorporated areas of the county, the project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater management permit to the county drainage board. The application will include a notice of intent letter (NOI), proof of public notice, construction plan sheets, stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and any other necessary support information. Specific information to be included in the application can be found in subsection (b)(3) of this section. Two copies of each application must be submitted to the county drainage board. Additionally, a digital copy of the construction plans is required in a format approved by the county drainage board. 
(2)  If the project must go through a scheduled meeting, all information must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting. The county drainage board shall furnish the applicant a written list of objections to the plans and supporting data submitted by the applicant. A resubmittal from the applicant addressing the list of objections shall be provided to the county drainage board at least ten days prior to the scheduled meeting. Plans in substantial compliance with the requirements of this article and the technical standards that need to go through a scheduled meeting shall be placed on the agenda with a recommendation for conditional approval or construction approval. If the county drainage board approves the project, the plans will be signed by the county surveyor's office after construction approval has been granted. 
(3)  If the project does not require county drainage board approval at a scheduled meeting, the county surveyor's office will provide written comments and sign the plans after construction approval has been granted. Once the plans have been signed, and after a preconstruction meeting has been held, construction can commence. 
(4)  The project site owner must notify the county drainage board and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) 48 hours before beginning construction. Notification shall be in the form of an updated NOI. Once construction starts, the project owner shall monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater pollution prevention measures in compliance with this article and the terms and conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction activities, as-built plans must be submitted to the county drainage board. A notice of termination (NOT) shall be sent to the county drainage board once the construction site has been stabilized and all temporary erosion and sediment control measures have been removed. The county drainage board, or representative, shall inspect the construction site to verify the requirements for an NOT have been met. Once the applicant receives a "verified" copy of the NOT, they must forward a copy to the IDEM. Permits issued under this scenario will expire five years from the date of issuance. If construction is not completed within five years, the NOI must be resubmitted at least 90 days prior to expiration. No additional Rule 5 (327 IAC 15-5) permit is required from the IDEM for projects within the unincorporated areas of the county since the county drainage board is mandated to serve as a quality local program, which is viewed by the IDEM as the equivalent to Rule 5. 
(c)  Within other jurisdictional areas. For projects located within other jurisdictional areas, but impacting county-regulated drains, the project site owner must submit two copies of the construction plans (which include drainage plans), erosion and sediment control plans, and a stormwater drainage technical report to the county drainage board. Additionally, a digital copy of the construction plans is required in a format approved by the county drainage board. If the project must go through a scheduled meeting, all information must be submitted at least 30 days prior to its regularly scheduled meeting. The county drainage board shall furnish the applicant a written list of objections to the plans and supporting data submitted by the applicant. This list of objections, if any, will be related only to the project's impact on county-regulated drains. A resubmittal from the applicant addressing the list of objections shall be provided to the county drainage board at least ten days prior to the scheduled meeting. Plans in substantial compliance with the requirements of this article and the technical standards that need to go through a scheduled meeting shall be placed on the agenda with a recommendation for conditional approval or construction approval. If the county drainage board approves the project, the applicant must satisfactorily address all issues listed in the conditional approval to obtain construction approval. This approval does not alleviate the applicant's responsibility to comply with the article, policy, or resolution requirements of the local jurisdictional entity.

Sec. 14-7. - Inspections. 
(a)  Appointment, duties of fire inspector. The fire chief is empowered and authorized to appoint a fire inspector, with approval of the board of public works and safety, to inspect places of public assembly, halls, auditoriums, theaters, commercial and industrial buildings, hospitals, schools, multi-family structures, and other institutions for existing and potential fire hazards, for adequacy of fire escapes and fire exits, efficiency of any fire protection equipment, and general compliance with fire prevention laws.

The fire inspector shall be a regular member of the city fire department and shall perform the duties, as outlined above, on a regular basis and, in addition, shall perform any other particular duties as ordered by the fire chief. 
(b)  Ascertaining and correcting conditions or causes of fire. The fire chief and/or designee shall cause to be inspected all structures and premises except the interiors of private single-family dwellings, and dwelling units in two-family and multi-family dwellings for the purpose of ascertaining and causing to be corrected any conditions liable to cause fire, contribute to the spread of fire, interfere with firefighting operations, endanger life, or any violations of the provisions or intent of this Code affecting fire safety. 
(c)  Manner of inspecting places and public ways. The fire chief shall specify the schedule under which places and public ways are inspected and may exclude a class of places or public ways from inspection under this section if the fire chief determines that the public interest will be served without inspection. 
(1)  New construction. Required inspections completed by the fire inspector and/or his designee shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Site. 
b.  Pre-drywall (rough-in). 
c.  Above ceiling. 
d.  Pre-final. 
e.  Final certificate of occupancy. 
f.  Sprinkler system rough-in. 
g.  Sprinkler system final. 
h.  Fire alarm rough-in. 
i.  Fire alarm final. 
These required inspections may run concurrent. 
(2)  Existing Class 1 structures. The inspection is completed by a state-certified fire inspector. At the time the inspection occurs, the inspector will evaluate the premises for violations of the applicable rules of FPBSC, this Code, and other documents as adopted by the FPBSC. At the completion of the inspection, the inspector will review the results with the occupant and leave a copy of the inspection report with the occupant. At the end of the correction period, a re-inspection will occur in approximately 30 to 45 days to determine if the violations have been corrected. If the previously cited violations are found to be corrected, no other action shall be needed. If violations are found to still exist after this first re-inspection, then a copy of the inspection form will be left with the occupant and the results reviewed with the occupant. The occupant shall then forward it to the owner. A second re-inspection will occur in approximately 15 days and a fee, as per this Code, shall be assessed. If the previously cited violations are corrected at this re-inspection, then no further action shall be required. If previously cited violations are found, a fee shall be assessed and a third re-inspection will occur in approximately five days. If those violations are not corrected, a fee shall be assessed for each re-inspection, and those re-inspections will occur every five days until the violations are corrected. If, at any time, an inspector completes an inspection and finds an immediate fire or life-safety hazard, the violation shall be corrected immediately. In the event the violation cannot be corrected immediately, a fire/life-safety order will be issued and the violation must be corrected by the date on the order. Failure to correct the violation by the date on the order will result in a fee and may cause further legal action to be taken against the violator. Please note that the fees/fines of this chapter are in addition to those fees/fines that may be levied by the state or city. 
(3)  Limits. The inspection or permitting of any building, system, or plan by the fire department, under the requirements of this Code and the applicable rules of the FPBSC, shall not be construed as a warranty of the physical condition of such building, system, or plan or the adequacy thereof nor as an approval thereof. Neither the city, the fire department nor any of its agents shall be liable in tort for damages for any defect or hazardous or illegal condition or inadequacy in such building, system, or plan, nor for any failure on any component of such which may occur subsequent to such inspection or permitting. 
(d)  Enforcement responsibility. Whenever in the enforcement of this Code the responsibility of more than one official of the city is involved, it shall be their duty to coordinate their inspections and administrative orders as fully as practicable so that the owners and occupants of the structure shall not be subjected to visits by numerous inspectors nor multiple or conflicting orders. Whenever an inspector from any agency or department observes an apparent or actual violation of some provisions of some law, ordinance or code of the city not within the inspector's authority to enforce, the inspector shall report the findings to the official having jurisdiction.

(d)  Fire department plan review shall occur at the following phases: site plan, construction plan, and fire protection systems plan. This review shall run concurrent to the city plan review and any issues or corrections that need to be made to the plans shall be completed by the developer prior to the approval of the city council and the city fire department. No city or city fire department approvals or permits shall be given or issued until review as provided herein and compliance has occurred. 
(e)  Plans shall be submitted to the fire department prior to any alteration, addition, or demolition of any part of a building equipped with an automatic fire suppression system and/or automatic fire detection and/or fire alarm system. 
(Prior Code, § 63.7; altered in 2019 recodification)

(Prior Code, § 24.06; Ord. No. 11-68, §§ 1-4; Ord. No. 39-78, § 1; Ord. No. 26-10) 
Sec. 20-28. - Powers and duties. 
    The human relations commission shall have the following powers and duties: 
(1)  To create subcommittees and advisory committees as in its judgment will aid in effectuating the purpose of this section; 
(2)  To issue such publications and such results of investigation and research as in its judgment will tend to minimize or eliminate discrimination because of "protected classification," or "protected class;" 
(3)  To accept complaints for filing. Complaints of discrimination shall be received and investigated by the human relations commission. To be acceptable, a complaint shall be sufficiently complete so as to reflect properly the name and address of the complainant; the name and address of respondent against whom the complaint is made; the alleged discriminatory practice and a statement of particulars thereof; the date or dates and places of the alleged discriminatory practice; if it is of a continuing nature, the dates between which continuing acts of discrimination are alleged to have occurred; and a statement as to any other action, civil or criminal, instituted in any other form based upon the same grievance as is alleged in the complaint; together with a statement as to the status or disposition of such other action. No complaint shall be valid unless filed within 90 days from the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory practice, or from the date of the termination of a published and meaningful grievance procedure provided by a respondent employer or labor union; provided that complaints filed only with the equal employment opportunity commission shall be deemed to have been filed simultaneously with the human relations commission for purposes of measuring the 90-day limitation, as long as the complaint is otherwise within the human relation commission's jurisdiction; provided further, that any person who files a complaint with the state civil rights commission shall have no recourse to the city human relations commission concerning any of the matters alleged in such complaint, except upon transfer of the case; provided, further, that the human relations commission shall have no jurisdiction over the state or any of its agencies, or over the city or any of its departments; 
(4)  To appoint a mediator to facilitate mediation of a complaint. The chair of the human relations commission may, at any time, refer the parties to attend mediation, whereupon the parties may choose to sign a statement agreeing to mediation and to pay any expenses thereof. All parties shall attend any such mediation in person or by telephonic or other electronic means, participate in good faith, and pay the costs of such mediation, including fees for the mediator, if any; 
(5)  To investigate each complaint properly filed. Upon the proper filing of a complaint and if a complaint is not fully resolved by a mediation, the chair of the human relations commission shall appoint a member of the commission to investigate the complaint and determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a prohibited act of discrimination occurred. When the recommendation after the investigation is no probable cause, the complainant shall be furnished a copy of the findings of fact and recommendations and shall be given ten days to make a written request, with the reasons therefor, to the chair of the commission for review of the finding. Upon the receipt of the request for review, the chair or chair's designee shall review the request and the decision of the reviewing commissioner regarding probable cause shall be final; 
(6)  To schedule and conduct a conciliation conference. After a determination of probable cause, the chair may appoint a commissioner to undertake conciliation of all issues in the complaint or require the parties to participate in mediation. Prior to a public hearing to adjudicate the complaint, the human relations commission shall schedule a conciliation conference. All parties shall attend any such conciliation conference; 
(7)  To schedule complaints for public hearings upon a determination of probable cause if a complaint is not fully resolved by a mediation. The chair shall appoint a hearing committee or refer the case for hearing by the full commission. However, no commissioner who has participated in the determination of probable cause shall sit as a commissioner to hear the case; 
(8)  To prevent any person from discharging, expelling, or otherwise discriminating against any other person because the person filed a complaint or testified in any hearing before the commission or in any way assisted in any matter under investigation; 
(9)  To issue a temporary emergency order against any person requiring such person to do an act preserving the possibility of a remedy for a complaint or to refrain from doing an act damaging the possibility of a remedy during the investigation of the complaint; provided, however: 
a.  That no emergency order shall be issued unless a time and place for hearing on the temporary order is designated in the order; 
b.  That the hearing on the temporary emergency order shall be held within ten days following the issuance of the temporary order, unless continued by the commission at the request of the respondent. At such hearing, the complainant shall show that a failure to continue the temporary order would damage a remedy. The commission shall thereupon weigh the comparative hardship to the complainant and respondent and issue a decision continuing or terminating the temporary emergency order, pending final disposition of the complaint. The respondent may waive the hearing on the temporary emergency order without prejudice to the defense of the matters charged in the complaint, in which case the temporary order shall remain in effect pending final disposition of the complaint; 
c.  The commission may by rule provide for issuance of its temporary order by a majority of the commission, and it may compel compliance with any such temporary order by bringing an action in any circuit or superior court for prohibitory or mandatory injunction upon showing that such person is subject to the court's jurisdiction; resides or transacts business within the county in which the proceeding is brought; and that such injunction is necessary to protect the complainant's rights under this section until the complaint is resolved through mediation, conciliation or public hearing; 
(10)  To reduce the terms of settlement agreed to by the parties in writing at either a mediation or at a conciliation conference, to be called a consent agreement, which the parties and a majority of the commissioners shall sign. When so signed, the consent agreement shall have the same effect as a cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (9) of this section. If the commission determines that a party is not complying with it, the commission may obtain enforcement of the consent agreement in a circuit or superior court upon showing that the party is not complying with the consent agreement, and the party is subject to the commission's jurisdiction, and resides or transacts business within the county in which the petition for enforcement is brought; 
(11)  To hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, administer oaths, take testimony of any person under oath and require the production for examination of all books and papers relating to any matter under investigation or in question before the commission. The commission may make rules governing the issuance of subpoenas by individual commissioners. Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena or temporary emergency order issued pursuant to this section shall be a breach of this article and such person shall be liable to a penalty therefore, if adjudged by the circuit or superior court, of the payment of a penalty in an amount established by the city or by state law or court order. Each penalty shall be deposited in the general fund of the city; provided, however, that the payment of such penalty by a party shall not impair the commission's ability to grant affirmative relief and compensatory damages to the complainant, should justice so require; 
(12)  To state its findings of fact after hearing, which statement shall be made in a written opinion containing both the findings of fact and the principles of law applied. All written opinions shall be compiled and maintained as public record and, in making decisions, the commission shall give due consideration to its prior decisions which may be applicable. If a majority of the commissioners who hear the case finds that a person has engaged in unlawful discriminatory practice, the commission shall cause to be served on the person an order requiring the person to cease and desist from the unlawful discriminatory practice and requiring such person to take further affirmative action necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section: 
a.  If unlawful discrimination is found in the area of employment, an order shall be issued requiring the respondent to take such affirmative action, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement and upgrading of employees or people deprived of employment, with or without compensatory damages to which the complainants would have been entitled had they not been deprived of equal opportunity; provided, that this subsection shall not be construed to require any employer to modify physical accommodations or administrative procedures to accommodate a handicapped person; 
b.  If unlawful discrimination is found in the area of housing or acquisition of real property, an order may be issued requiring a respondent to take affirmative action, including, but not limited to, renting, selling or leasing to a person deprived of equal opportunity. Compensation for the denial of equal opportunity shall be allowed within the discretion of the commission; 
c.  If unlawful discrimination is found in the area of public accommodation, an order shall be issued requiring respondent to take affirmative action, including, but not limited to, providing services, goods or access to property, instatement to membership, reinstatement to membership, posting of notice that a facility is a public accommodation, with or without compensatory damages for a complainant being denied equal opportunity; 
d.  If unlawful discrimination is found in the area of education, an order may be issued requiring a respondent to take affirmative action, including, but not limited to, a review and revision of school boundaries, revision of teaching aids and materials, human relations training for personnel recruitment of minority people for professional staff, with or without compensatory damages to which the complainant would have been entitled except for the denial of equal opportunity; 
e.  If, upon all the evidence, the commission finds that a person has not engaged in any such unlawful practice or violation of this section, the commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant an order dismissing the complaint as to such person; 
f.  Judicial review of such cease and desist order, or other final order, or other affirmative action or damages as referred to in this article may be obtained by filing in the circuit or superior courts. The scope of review shall be in accordance with the provisions set out in IC 22-9-1-12.1. If no proceeding to obtain judicial review is instituted within 15 days from the receipt of notice by a person that such order has been made by the commission, the commission, if it determines that the person upon whom the cease and desist order has been served is not complying or is making no effort to comply, may obtain a decree of a court for the enforcement of such order in circuit or superior court upon showing that such person is subject to the commission's jurisdiction and resides or transacts business within the county in which the petition for enforcement is brought, or may request the corporation counsel or attorney representing the complainant to seek enforcement; 
(13)  To refer the complaint to the state civil rights commission for investigation and resolution.

Sec. 40-49. - Reporting requirements for permittee. 
(a)  Compliance schedule reports (for non-categorical industries). Any non-categorical industry which is not in compliance with the city's ordinance limitations must develop a compliance schedule during which time the industry must meet the city's standards. The schedule should contain increments of progress which correspond to specific dates for their completion. All significant industrial users (SIU) subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 calendar days following each date in the compliance schedule. This report must include whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no event can more than nine months elapse between progress reports. 
(b)  Self-monitoring reports. This requirement calls for the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from SIUs that are necessary to assess and ensure compliance by SIUs with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. These reports will normally be required on a monthly basis. 
(c)  Baseline reports. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to the POTW will be required to submit to the control authority a report containing the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(7). Upon promulgation of a categorical pretreatment standard, the control authority will provide the appropriate 40 CFR 403.12(b) form for distribution to the industrial users who are affected by the promulgated standard. The industrial users are then required to submit the completed report to the control authority. 
(d)  Compliance schedule reports (categorical industries). This schedule is necessary whenever an industrial user is not meeting categorical pretreatment standards at the time of promulgation of that standard. The schedule contains increments of progress which correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard. All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the control authority no later than 14 calendar days following each date in the compliance schedule including the final date for compliance. This report must include, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on the date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event can more than nine months elapse between such progress reports. 
(Prior Code, § 30.03.3) 
Sec. 40-50. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  Methods for measurement of industrial waste flows. Any significant industrial user (SIU) who, on the effective date of these regulations, is discharging industrial waste to the POTW shall provide the city independent access means and facilities for the purpose of observation, measurement and sampling of such industrial waste. If such access means and facilities are not otherwise available, the SIU shall construct and maintain a control manhole at the SIU's expense. The city shall have full access at all times to the SIU's monitoring facility or facilities to conduct tests on quality and quantity of effluent. The volume or quantity of industrial waste discharged by any SIU into the POTW may be measured by one or more of the following methods: 
(1)  If the volume of water used by any SIU in its industrial or process operations is greater than 85 percent of the volume obtained from the city water works system, then the volume of water purchased from such system shall be considered to be the volume of waste discharged; 
(2)  If the volume of water used for industrial purposes is less than 85 percent of the volume of water obtained from the city water works system, then the quantity of industrial wastes generated by an SIU shall be determined as follows: 
a.  By a meter or meters on the water supply line or lines to the SIU's industrial and/or process operations; or 
b.  By a meter or meters on the waste line or lines from the SIU's industrial and/or process operations. 
(b)  Meters. If any SIU now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste to the POTW does not obtain its entire water supply requirements from the city water works system, the SIU shall install and maintain a meter or meters from its industrial and/or process operations or shall install such additional meters on the private water supply as required to permit a determination of the total amount of discharge to the sewers from all sources under procedures comparable to subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
(c)  Location of monitoring facilities. The city shall require, to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical for purposes of providing for independent and unscheduled monitoring activities or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street, right-of-way, parkway or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measurement equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such sampling and monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as to enable city personnel to perform independent and unscheduled monitoring activities. 
(Prior Code, § 30.03.4) 
Sec. 40-51. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purposes of this article are being met and all requirements are being met. Owners or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative, bearing proper credentials and identification, ready access at all times of operation to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspections, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities.

Sec. 40-52. - Pretreatment. 
    Significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent meeting Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards and acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. The city shall annually publish in the newspaper of general circulation having the largest circulation within the city a list of users which were not in compliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user during the same 12 months. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the city, the EPA or the approval authority.

(1)  City monitoring. 
a.  Minimum of one scheduled monitoring event per year to include site inspection, records review and sampling (minimum one 24-hour composite). 
b.  Minimum of one unscheduled monitoring event per year to include site inspection, records review and sampling (minimum one 24-hour composite). 
c.  Demand monitoring to consist of site inspection, records review and seven consecutive days of 24-hour composite sampling to be performed, when warranted in the opinion of the board, in response to a known or suspected violation discovered in a self-monitoring report, routine sampling trip, by public complaint or any discharge of prohibited material. 
(2)  Self-monitoring. 
a.  As required for Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard Compliance monitoring. 
b.  As established in significant industrial user wastewater discharge permit, but, in any case, not less than the total minimums set forth in subsection (3) of this section, unless expressly approved by the board. 
(3)  Minimum monitoring frequency guidelines for case by case permit requirement. 
Industrial Flow 
(Average gallons per day) Monitoring frequency 0-10,000 Once every six months 10,001-25,000 Once every three months 25,001-50,000 Once every two months 50,001-100,000 Once per month Greater than 100,000 Once every two weeks  
These monitoring frequencies may be a combination of POTW scheduled and unscheduled monitoring and industrial self-monitoring. The city may require more frequent monitoring based on potential degree of impact on the POTW, variability in types or amounts of pollutants discharged or concentration or loading of conventional pollutants. 
(4)  Six-month review of monitoring frequency. After six months of actual monitoring experience, each significant industrial user shall submit a report assessing the adequacy of their monitoring schedule. If the data exhibit a high degree of statistical variance, the city may require an increased frequency of self-monitoring to determine the cause. If the data are uniform, exhibit a low degree of statistical variance with the city's monitoring, and justification is accepted by the board, the self-monitoring requirement may be relaxed. 
(Prior Code, § 30.08.1) 
Sec. 40-172. - Surveillance survey charge. 
    The charge for each surveillance survey shall be based on the cost of sample collection, analysis and reporting as well as site inspection and records evaluation costs. The board is hereby empowered to review on an annual basis the actual costs versus charges for surveillance and to adjust charges accordingly to achieve cost reimbursement. 
(Prior Code, § 30.08.2) 
Sec. 40-173. - Monitoring of significant industrial users. 
(a)  A significant industrial user (SIU) shall install, at its own expense, monitoring facilities as required in section 40-50, unless said SIU can demonstrate to the board that compliance with this requirement would cause undue hardship. In such cases, the board shall provide for alternate monitoring procedures in the SIU's wastewater discharge permit. The city shall have the right of full access to said monitoring station, at all times, to conduct tests on quantity and quality of effluent. 
(b)  The city may provide metering and/or monitoring equipment during a surveillance period for control manholes or other access means supplemental to those provided by the user. Required monitoring equipment may, if the board determines it to be necessary, after public notice and a hearing, include a device for continuously automatically measuring and recording flow and a device for automatically taking discrete hourly and composite samples of wastewater during each 24-hour period. In the event of continuing violation of discharge limits in the permit of a SIU, the city may also, in addition, after public notice and hearing, require monitoring equipment which shall include a real time analytical device, suitable for the nature of the wastewater being monitored, to provide instantaneous indications of a potential discharge incident which may cause maximum limitations of the SIU's wastewater discharge permit to be exceeded. Existing SIUs shall construct control manholes or other access facilities and install required monitoring equipment at all points of discharge of process wastewater and have the equipment in operation by December 1, 1993, or the compliance date for the subject pretreatment standard, whichever is earlier. New SIUs shall construct control manholes and install, and have ready for operation, monitoring equipment before beginning the discharge of wastewater. The city shall review the calibration procedure at the flow monitoring station and shall have the right to be present during calibration. Any violation of the requirements for the construction of control manholes and installation and operation of monitoring equipment shall be punishable by a fine in an amount established by the city for each daily violation. Each daily violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. Each SIU shall measure and record the following data on a schedule established in their permit: Total daily wastewater discharge (gallons per day), concentration of each waste constituent or characteristic specified in the permit (mg/l), total daily discharge of each waste constituent or characteristic specified in the permit (lb/day). All analyses shall be performed under the procedures outlined in Standard Methods for the Analysis of Water and Wastewater and Industrial Waste or, absent such standard methods, by analytical techniques approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
(c)  The city may monitor and analyze the wastewater stream of any SIU on a daily basis when just cause exists. If, at any time, the rate of wastewater discharge or concentration or quantity of a constituent of characteristic exceeds the maximum limits established in the permit, the utility director shall be notified as required under section 40-48(i)(9), (10).

Where any provisions of this ordinance impose restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control, unless otherwise stated herein. However, those provisions within the unified zoning ordinance shall always control where the standards under this ordinance are less restrictive than those of the unified zoning ordinance.

Sec. 101.01.8. - Saving provision. 
(1)  This ordinance shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of the pre-existing subdivision ordinance, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of a participating jurisdiction under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm or corporation, by lawful action of the participating jurisdictions except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations. 
(2)  Any proposed or actual subdivision of land having been granted preliminary and/or final plat approval by the commission under the previous subdivision control ordinance shall be held to the provisions of that previous ordinance only and not to the provisions of this ordinance, including existing provisions of time extension for preliminary plat approval. Any proposed subdivision of land for which a complete application seeking preliminary plat approval and fee have been submitted to the executive director prior to the date of enactment of this ordinance shall be held to the provisions of the previous subdivision control ordinance only, and not to the provisions of this ordinance. 
(3)  Any division of land, or any act done prior to the enactment of this ordinance, and subsequent to July 1, 1978, which division or act was in violation of any ordinance repealed by this ordinance, shall be subject to all remedies, penalties and defenses under the repealed ordinance. 
(4)  Any subdivision qualifying under paragraphs (1) or (2) of subsection [101.0]1.8, having been granted either sketch plan, preliminary, or final approval under previous ordinances and prior to September 1, 1982, and subsequently having completed the requirements for recording under those ordinances, may be signed by the designated officials as having been granted secondary approval and permitted to record the plat. 
Sec. 101.01.9. - Repealer.

Sec. 101.01.10. - Conditions. 
    Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of conditions as provided for in this ordinance to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated by the state to these participating jurisdictions. The developer has the duty of compliance with conditions laid down by this ordinance to be reviewed by the commission for design, dedication, improvement, and restrictive use of the land so as to conform to the physical and economical development of these participating jurisdictions and to the safety and general welfare of the future plot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large. 
Sec. 101.01.11. - Resubdivision of land. 
(1)  Procedure for resubdivision. For any change in a plat of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on such plat, or area reserved thereon for public use, such plat shall be considered by the commission by the same procedure, rules, and regulations of a subdivision. 
(2)  Procedure for subdivisions where future resubdivision is indicated. Whenever a parent tract is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the commission may require that such plat allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat. 
Sec. 101.01.12. - Variance. 
    Where the rigid enforcement of the requirements, standards and specifications imposed by this ordinance, because of the unusual conditions of an individual plat, would result in extraordinary hardship peculiar to the particular land or deny the reasonable use of the land involved therein, the subdivider, at the time of making application for approval of a preliminary plat of a subdivision and with said applications, may make written request for modification by stating what requirements, standards and specifications that the applicant desires modified and to what extent. Such requested modifications shall be referred immediately to the appropriate participating jurisdiction for their approval or rejection. If such participating jurisdiction approves of such modifications in writing, or fails to either approve or disapprove within 30 days after the same has been referred to them, the commission may modify such requirement, standards and specifications so as to promote the public health, safety, and welfare, and prevent detriment to the use and value of said land, provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as altering or conflicting with the powers and duties of the board of zoning appeals pursuant to Chapter 138 of the Acts of the Indiana General Assembly for 1957, as amended. No authority to modify shall exist in the commission if the appropriate participating jurisdiction by writing disapproves such modification. 
Sec. 101.01.13. - Enforcement, violations, and penalties. 
(1)  General. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the executive director of the commission to enforce this ordinance and to bring to the attention of the commission attorney any violations or lack of compliance herewith.

(c)  No improvement location permit or building permit required under the uniform building code, the unified zoning ordinance or this ordinance shall be issued on any property subject to this ordinance until the provisions of this ordinance have been complied with. 
(2)  Limits of land transfers. No owner, subdivider, or subdivision agent of the owner, of any land located in a proposed subdivision shall transfer or sell or lease any such land for purposes of subdivision as defined in this ordinance before a final plat of such subdivision has been signed by the designated officials and recorded in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(3)  Violations and penalties. Any person who violates a provision of this ordinance or any regulations herein contained, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be fined not less than $10.00 and not more than $300.00 for each day's violation.

Sec. 101.03. - SUBDIVISION APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND APPROVAL PROCESSES 
Sec. 101.03.1. - General Procedure. 
(1)  Classification of land divisions. All land to be divided shall be categorized into one of three (3) main classes of land division indicated within this ordinance's definition of subdivision. These classes are: 
(a)  Subdivisions, major and minor. 
(b)  Parcelizations, except that the actual location, shape, size and boundaries of a parcel established by a recorded parcelization shall not be changed, altered, added to or reduced by any provision, exempt division or exemption provided for in this ordinance except by dissolution of the parcelization or a parcel thereof under section [101.0]3.5(7) of this ordinance. (Ord. No. 11-96) 
(c)  Exempt divisions. 
    Exempt divisions are not subject to the requirements of this ordinance. Lots created by exempt division shall be ten or more acres in size to be eligible as principal use building sites (Exemption A in the definition of subdivision), unless such lots have been created by order of a court (Exemption C). Subsequent to the adoption of this amendment (on June 6, 1988 by the Tippecanoe County commissioners; on July 11, 1988 by the Lafayette City Council; on June 6, 1988 by the West Lafayette City Council; on July 5, 1988 by the Battle Ground Town Board; on July 11, 1988 by the Dayton Town Board), no principal use building site created through Exemption A shall be reduced below ten acres unless by subdivision, parcelization, or order of a court (Exemption C). For purposes of this paragraph, a lot is "created" on the date of its recording. 
    Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to be erected on land to be subdivided, the subdividing owner or his subdivision agent shall apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with section[101.0]3.2 and either section[101.0]3.3 or section[101.0]3.4 of this ordinance. Before any permit shall be granted for a structure to be erected on land to be parcelized, the land divider or his agent shall certify to the satisfaction of the staff of the commission that all requirements for parcelization have been met, as detailed in section[101.0]3.5 of this ordinance. Revised 8-88. 
(2)  Discussion of requirements. Prior to submitting any of the materials required by this ordinance, the applicant or his representative should discuss with the staff of the commission the nature of the land division being proposed, so that the applicant may be instructed as to the need to either subdivide or parcelize and the procedures that must be followed in either case. Where subdivision is called for, requirements as to general layout of streets and for reservations of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection, and similar matters, as well as the availability of existing services should be discussed. The staff shall also advise the applicant, where appropriate, to discuss the proposed land division with those officials who must eventually approve those aspects of the parcelization or subdivision plat coming within their jurisdiction. The distinction between major and minor subdivision as defined in this ordinance, shall be made by the staff when the applicant submits an application for sketch plan approval. 
    However, the further division of a parent tract from which four lots or parcels eligible as principal use building sites have already been created (whether by minor subdivision, parcelization or a combination of both), shall be classified as a major subdivision, unless this further division is exempt because the additional lots are ten or more acres in size (Exemption A in the definition of subdivision), or because the lots have been created by order of a court (Exemption C). For purposes of this paragraph, a lot is "created" on the date of its recording. 
Sec. 101.03.2. - All subdivisions: sketch plan application procedure. 
(1)  Application requirements. In order to begin the subdivision process, the applicant shall file an application for review of sketch plan and certificate with the commission's staff and be entitled to a signed receipt for same. This application shall: 
(a)  Be made on forms available at the office of the commission and signed by the owner. 
(b)  Include indication of all contiguous holdings of the owner including land in the same ownership, with an indication of the portion which is proposed to be subdivided, accompanied by an affidavit of ownership, which shall include the dates the respective holdings of land were acquired, together with the book and page of each conveyance to the present owner as recorded in the county recorder's Office. The affidavit shall advise as to the legal owner of the property, the contract owner of the property, optionee of the property, and the date contract of sale was executed. If any corporations are involved, the commission may request a complete list of all directors, officers, and a listing of stockholders if less than ten in number. Revised 8-88. 
(c)  Be presented to the staff of the commission in duplicate. 
(d)  Be accompanied by a minimum of three copies of the sketch plan. 
(e)  Be accompanied by a fee of $50.00 plus $5.00 per lot in excess of four lots. 
(f)  Include an address and telephone number of an agent located within the territory of the commission who shall be authorized to receive all notices required by this ordinance. 
(g)  Include a listing signed by the checkpoint agencies indicating that they have received a copy of the proposed sketch plan or a certification that it has been sent. 
(2)  Checkpoint submission. In order to fulfill this last application requirement, a copy of the proposed plan shall be submitted to each of the agencies appropriate to the plan's location so that comment may be made to the staff. The checkpoint agencies appropriate to each participating jurisdiction in which a plat may be located are listed in Figure 1. The executive director shall request that all officials and agencies to whom a request for review has been made, submit a written report to him within 15 days after receipt of the request. No response from an agency shall be interpreted as meaning "no objection." 
(3)  Classification of subdivision. With an application for sketch plan approval submitted, the staff shall classify the proposed subdivision either major or minor as defined in this ordinance. The required procedures and approvals that make up the major subdivision are described in section [101.0]3.3; corresponding information concerning the minor subdivision process is provided in section [101.0]3.4. 
Sec. 101.03.3. - Major subdivisions. 
(1)  General procedures. Should the staff, upon examination of the sketch plan application, classify the proposed land division as a major subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and be subject to the processes outlined in Figure 2, and detailed in this section. In addition to a sketch plan which is reviewed by the commission's staff and checkpoint agencies, the applicant seeking approval of a major subdivision plat to be approved, conditionally approved or rejected by the commission at a public meeting, and a final subdivision plat which must be granted secondary approval and signed by the designated officials in order to be recorded per I.C. 36-7-4-700 series-subdivision control [IC 36-7-4-700 et seq.].

(2)  Official submission dates. The deadline for submittal of a sketch plan and application for certificate of approval shall be 61 calendar days prior to the date of the public meeting at which the subdivider intends to have his preliminary plat submission heard, and 31 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of the preliminary plat. Thus, as a minimum, sketch plan submission shall precede preliminary plat submission by no less than 31 calendar days, which in turn shall precede the public meeting at which it is intended to be heard by no less than 30 calendar days. 
(3)  Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the subdivider's sketch plan application submittal, the commission's staff shall have studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received, and met with the subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the proposed subdivision and possible modifications and/or changes that may be suggested or required by this ordinance. The executive director shall request that a representative of each checkpoint agency wishing to be involved in a sketch plan review be present to participate in the sketch plan review meeting. In taking into consideration the requirements of this ordinance, particular attention shall be given to the arrangement, location, and width of streets, their relation to the topography of the land, sewage disposal, drainage, lot size and arrangement, the further development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided, and the requirements of the official map and comprehensive plan as adopted by the participating jurisdictions. Subsequent to the meeting the commission's staff shall provide the participants with a written record of the proceedings of that meeting. 
(4)  Preliminary subdivision plat procedure. 
(a)  Submission requirements. Following the submission, review and report on the sketch plan application, the subdivider may file for primary approval of a preliminary plat. This submission shall: 
(i)  Be made on forms available at the office of the commission and be submitted with fee of $5.00 per lot for each lot which was not included in the sketch plan. 
(ii)  Include indication of all land which the applicant proposes to subdivide and all land immediately adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, or of that directly opposite thereto, extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land, with the names of the owners as shown in the auditor's files. This information may be shown on a separate current plat map reproduction from the auditor's office showing the boundaries of the subdivision superimposed thereon. 

(iii)  Be presented in duplicate to the staff of the commission no later than 30 calendar days prior to the regular meeting of the commission at which it is intended to be heard. 
(iv)  Be accompanied by ten copies of the preliminary plat as described in this ordinance. 
(v)  Generally comply with the sketch plan as reviewed. 
(b)  Placement on the commission agenda. Subsequent to the submission for primary approval, the commission shall place the matter on its next regular meeting agenda for formal action. 
(c)  Staff review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and prior to the date of public hearing, the commission's staff shall review the proposal and prepare a written report to the commission and applicant indicating staff's recommendation with regard to the subdivision being proposed. 
(d)  Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The commission shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary plat and notice of such hearing shall be in two local newspapers of general circulation ten days prior to the hearing (per I.C. 5-3-1 [IC ch. 5-3-1]) at the applicant's expense. At the time of the public hearing, the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the applicant has placed posters advising interested parties of the hearing provided by the staff of the commission at the locations designated by the staff on the proposed subdivision property at least ten days prior to the public hearing and show proofs of publication that the notices of public hearing were published at least ten days prior to the public hearing. Interested parties shall be notified by the applicant of the time, date, place, and purpose of the public hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in advance of the hearing by certified mail. The applicant shall file with the commission at the time of the public hearing an affidavit so testifying. 
(e)  Approval of the preliminary plat (primary approval). After the commission has held a hearing upon the preliminary plat, the staff's report, checkpoint recommendations, and testimony and exhibits submitted at the public hearing, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes and/or additions. The commission shall, at a public meeting, grant primary approval, or disapprove the preliminary plat. One copy of the preliminary plat shall be returned to the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval and the reasons therefore accompanying the plat within five days of the public hearing. Before the commission grants primary approval of a plat showing park reservation or land for other local government unit, the commission shall obtain approval of the park or land reservation from the participating jurisdiction. Primary approval by the commission is subject to review by certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until a minimum of 30 days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval, per I.C. 36-7-4-708(d) [IC 36-7-4-708(d)]. 
(f)  Field trip. The commission, at its discretion, upon hearing the request for primary approval, may elect to continue the matter until its next regularly scheduled public meeting, and may schedule a field trip to the site of the proposed subdivision, accompanied by the applicant or his representative. 
(g)  Effective period of primary approval. Unless extended, the approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of five years at the end of which time secondary approval on the entire subdivision must have been obtained and certified by the designated officials of the commission. Any plats not receiving secondary approval within the period of time set forth herein shall be null and void, and the developer shall be required to resubmit a new application for sketch plan review and certificate subject to all the zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations and procedures in effect at the time of resubmission. Upon request of the applicant the commission may extend the primary approval of a plat in increments of two years beyond an expiration date without further notice and public hearing. 
(5)  Approval of construction plans. 
(a)  Submission procedure and requirements. Following the review of the sketch plan and prior to submission for secondary approval, the applicant, if he wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file with the executive director of the commission, before starting work on any improvements, three sets of the detailed plans and specifications thereof for approval. 
(b)  Review process. The executive director shall immediately refer these plans to the appropriate agencies of the effected participating jurisdictions for review. Once these agencies indicate their approval of the construction plans or 14 working days have elapsed since their distribution without a written response, the executive director shall stamp the plans approved and return one set to the applicant. In no event shall secondary approval be given prior to approval of the construction plans. 
(c)  Installation of improvements. The installation of improvements shall be inspected by the appropriate participating jurisdiction. Such inspections are required in all instances regardless of whether the work is performed before or after secondary approval. Failure to request inspection of work performed after the date of this ordinance and before secondary approval may be cause for denial of secondary approval. 
(6)  Final subdivision plat procedure. 
(a)  Submission requirements. Following primary approval and approval of construction plans, the applicant, if he wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file with the executive director of the commission a request for secondary approval of a subdivision plat. The application shall: 
(i)  Be submitted on forms available at the office of the executive director of the commission.

(vi)  Be accompanied by restrictive covenants in a form approved by the commission, where proposed by the subdivider or required by the commission. 
(b)  Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be recorded, a final subdivision plat shall be found to be in conformance with the primary approval either by the staff, or by the commission at a public meeting. If the final subdivision plat deviates from the preliminary plat that received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the commission at a public meeting for a new primary approval. The subdivider submitting a final plat conforming to the primary approval shall choose as to whether this review is performed by the staff, or by the commission at a public meeting. 
(i)  Should the subdivider not choose commission review, the staff shall within ten working days, review the items submitted as per section [101.0]3.3(6)(a) in order to ascertain conformance with the primary approval. If the submission is found to be in conformance and complete, the staff shall recommend the signing of the certificate granting secondary approval. 
(ii)  Should the subdivider choose commission review, the commission shall perform the same function but at a public meeting. The subdivider shall request in writing commission review no less than 30 calendar days prior to the date of the public meeting at which he intends to have his final plat reviewed. The commission shall place the matter on its next regular meeting agenda. Staff shall review the proposal and submit a written report and recommendations to the commission and the applicant; and the commission, at the public meeting, shall approve or disapprove the final plat. If granted secondary approval, it shall be signed by the designated officials. If not granted secondary approval, then the subdivider shall be informed as to the insufficiency of his submittal. 
(c)  Sectionalizing plats. Prior to granting secondary approval of a major subdivision plat, the commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat. The commission may require that the performance bond be in such amount as is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing. Such sections must contain at least 20 lots or ten percent of the total number of lots contained in the approved plat, whichever is less. The approval of all remaining sections not filed with the staff shall automatically expire after five years of the date of primary subdivision approval of the subdivision plat, unless the expiration date has been extended. 
(7)  Signing and recording a plat. 
(a)  Signing of a plat. 
(i)  When a bond is required, the designated officials shall endorse secondary approval on the plat by signing the certificate after the bond has been approved, and all conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied. 
(ii)  When installation of improvements is required, the designated officials shall endorse secondary approval on the plat by signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed. There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the participating jurisdiction as shown by a certificate signed by the board of works, county commissioners, town board or county drainage board that the necessary improvements have been accomplished. 
(b)  Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all improvements before he applies for secondary approval and it is shown that the conditions of the ordinance have been met, and if the final plat completely conforms to the primary approval, the commission shall grant secondary approval. 
(c)  Recording of plat. 
(i)  The designated officials shall sign the certificate granting secondary approval which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible Mylar of the subdivision plat, plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat. The Mylar prints shall be returned to the subdivider and his engineer or surveyor. 
(ii)  It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in the presence of the executive director or his designee to file the plat with the county recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. 
Sec. 101.03.4. - Minor Subdivisions. 
(1)  General procedures. Should the staff, upon examination of the sketch plan application, classify the proposed land division as a minor subdivision, the subdivider shall follow the procedures and be subject to the process outlined in Figure 3, and detailed in this Section. In addition to a sketch plan which is reviewed by the commission's staff and checkpoint agencies for primary approval by the commission or its Executive Committee, the applicant seeking approval of a minor subdivision shall submit a final subdivision plat which must be granted secondary approval and signed by the designated officials in order to be recorded per I.C. 36-7-4-700 series-subdivision control [IC 36-7-4-400 et seq.]. 
    Figure 3. Minor subdivision approval process. 
(2)  Official submission date and placement on the agenda. An application for primary approval of a minor subdivision sketch plan shall be submitted no less than 30 calendar days prior to either a regularly scheduled public meeting of the commission or a regularly scheduled meeting of the commission's Executive Committee at which the proposal is intended to be acted upon. Staff shall place such application on the agenda of the first regularly scheduled meeting of the commission or its executive committee to occur 30 days after the date the application is submitted. 
(3)  Sketch plan review process. Within 20 calendar days of the subdivider's sketch plan application submittal, the commission's staff shall have studied the proposal, reviewed checkpoint reports received, and met with the subdivider to discuss pertinent aspects of the proposed subdivision and possible modifications and/or changes that may be suggested or required by this ordinance. The executive director shall request that a representative of each checkpoint agency that wishes to be involved in a sketch plan review be present to participate in the sketch plan review meeting. In taking into consideration the requirements of this ordinance, particular attention shall be given to sewage disposal, drainage, lot size and arrangement, the further development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided, and the requirements of the Official Map and comprehensive plan as adopted by the participating jurisdictions. Subsequent to the meeting the commission's staff shall provide the participants with a written record of the proceedings of that meeting. 
(4)  Staff review. Subsequent to placement on the agenda, and prior to the date of public hearing, the commission's staff shall review the proposal and prepare a final written report to the commission and applicant indicating staff's recommendation with regard to the subdivision being proposed. 
(5)  Public hearing notification and sign posting requirements. The commission shall hold a public hearing on the sketch plan and notice of such hearing shall be in two local newspapers of general circulation ten days prior to the hearing (per I.C. 5-3-1 [IC ch. 5-3-1]) at the applicant's expense. At the time of the public hearing, the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the applicant has placed posters advising interested parties of the hearing provided by the staff of the commission at the locations designated by the staff on the proposed subdivision property at least ten days prior to the public hearing and show proofs of publication that the notices of public hearing were published at least ten days prior to the public hearing. Interested parties shall be notified by the applicant of the time, date, place, and purpose of the public hearing on the subdivision at least ten days in advance of the hearing by certified mail. The applicant shall file with the commission at the time of the public hearing an affidavit so testifying. 
(6)  Approval of the sketch plan (primary approval). After the commission or its executive committee has, at a regularly scheduled meeting, examined the sketch plan, staff's report, checkpoint recommendations and testimony and exhibits submitted, the commission or its executive committee shall grant primary approval or disapprove the sketch plan. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the applicant with the date of approval, conditional approval, or disapproval and the reasons therefore accompanying the sketch plan within five days after the public meeting. Primary approval by the commission is subject to review by certiorari. Secondary approval of a subdivision cannot occur until a minimum of 30 days has elapsed since the granting of primary approval, per I.C. 36-7-4-708(d) [IC 36-7-4-708(d)]. 
(7)  Final subdivision plat procedure. 
(a)  Application requirements. Following primary approval of the sketch plan, the applicant, if he wishes to proceed with the subdivision, shall file with the staff of the commission an application for secondary approval of a subdivision plat. The application shall: 
(i)  Be submitted on forms available at the Office of the commission. 
(ii)  Include the entire subdivision. 
(iii)  Be accompanied by ten copies of the final subdivision plat as described in this ordinance. 
(iv)  Totally comply with the ordinance and the terms and conditions of primary approval. 
(v)  Be accompanied by the performance bond, if required, in a form satisfactory to the commission attorney and in an amount established by the commission upon recommendation of the participating jurisdiction and shall guarantee the completion of all required subdivision and off-site public improvements. 
(vi)  Be accompanied by restrictive covenants in a form approved by the commission, where proposed by the subdivider or required by the commission. 
(b)  Determination of conformance (secondary approval). In order to be recorded, a final subdivision plat shall be found to be in conformance with the primary approval either by the staff or by the commission at a public meeting. If the final subdivision plat deviates from the sketch plan that received primary approval, the subdivision shall be resubmitted to the commission at a public meeting for a new primary approval. The subdivider submitting a final plat conforming to the primary approval shall choose as to whether this review is performed by the staff, or by the commission at a public meeting. 

(i)  Should the subdivider not choose commission review, the staff shall within ten working days, review the items submitted as per section [101.0]3.4(7)(a) in order to ascertain conformance with the primary approval. If the submission is found to be in conformance and complete, the staff shall recommend the signing of the certificate granting secondary approval. 
(ii)  Should the subdivider choose commission review, the commission shall perform the same function but at a public meeting. The subdivider shall request in writing commission review no less than 30 calendar days prior to the date of the public meeting at which he intends to have his final plat reviewed. The commission shall place the matter on its next regular meeting agenda; staff shall review the proposal and submit a written report and recommendations to the commission and the applicant; and the commission, at public meeting, shall approve or disapprove the final plat. If granted secondary approval it shall be signed by the designated officials. If not granted secondary approval then the subdivider shall be informed as to the insufficiency of his submittal. 
(c)  Sectionalizing plats. Prior to granting secondary approval of a minor subdivision plat, the commission may permit the plat to be divided into two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the filing of the sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly development of the plat. The commission may require that the performance bond be in such amount as is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer the remaining required performance bond principal amount until the remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing. 
(8)  Signing and recording a plat. 
(a)  Signing a plat. 
(i)  When a bond is required, the designated officials shall endorse secondary approval on the plat after the bond has been approved, and all conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied. 
(ii)  When installation of improvements is required the designated officials shall endorse secondary approval on the plat by signing the certificate after all conditions of the primary approval have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed. There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the participating jurisdiction as shown by a certificate signed by the board of works, county commissioners, town board or the county drainage board that the necessary improvements have been accomplished. 
(b)  Assurance to subdivider. If the subdivider elects to install all improvements before he applies for secondary approval and it is shown that the conditions of the ordinance have been met, and if the final plat completely conforms to the primary approval, the commission shall grant secondary approval. 
(c)  Recording of plat. 
(i)  The designated officials shall sign the certificate granting secondary approval which shall be part of the tracing cloth or reproducible Mylar of the subdivision plat, plus two Mylar prints of the subdivision plat. The Mylar prints shall be returned to the applicant and his engineer or surveyor. 
(ii)  It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider in the presence of the executive director or his designee to file the plat with the county recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. 
Sec. 101.03.5. - Parcelization. 
(1)  General procedure. Presubmission discussion between the prospective land divider or his agent and the staff of the commission will clarify the land divider's eligibility to use the parcelization process. Following such discussion, the land divider or his agent shall then file an application for parcelization review with the staff and provide the documents specified below. The staff and the executive director shall then review the complete submission for compliance with this section of the ordinance, and the staff shall notify the land divider or his agent of the results of that review. The land divider or his agent shall then file the approved parcelization with the county recorder within thirty calendar days of the end of the review process. Failure to so record shall automatically void the approved parcelization. 
(2)  Application requirements. The application for parcelization review shall: 
(a)  Be made, in duplicate, on forms available at the office of the commission; 
(b)  Include all documentation required in section [101.0]3.5(4); 
(c)  Include ten sets of legal descriptions for all parcels (under ten acres in area) being created. The land divider may, instead, submit ten sets of parcelization drawings, using section [101.0]6.4(1)(b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (i), (j), (l), (m) as a basis for the drawings' format; and 
(d)  Include the notarized consent of the legal owner or contract owner or optionee of the property (parent tract, lot or parcel) to be parcelized, if such person is different from the land divider. 
(3)  Standards. 
(a)  Number and area of parcels. The maximum number of parcels that can be created from a parent tract as defined in section [101.0]2.2 of this ordinance, and the minimum area of those parcels shall depend on the zoning classification of the land to be parcelized: 
Zoning Classification of Land 
to be Parcelized Maximum No. 
of Parcels Minimum Area of Parcels, 
Exclusive of Right-of-Way* A, AW, AA 2 2 acres  
*Unless Tippecanoe County Code Chapter 41 requires more. 
    A parcel may contain some FP-zoned land as well, but only if there is sufficient land within the non-FP portion to place a principal use building and its accessory buildings and paved areas and still conform with unified zoning ordinance sections [102.0]4.6 through [102.0]4.10, [115.0]4.14(b) and [102.0]4.15(e), and Tippecanoe County Code Chapter 41. Parcel area shall be measured exclusive of right-of-way. 
(b)  Parcels abutting a public road. For parcels that abut a public road, the minimum parcel width shall be 200 feet. All parcels on land zoned R3, AB, LB, LBS, GB, SC, I, or IR shall abut a public road. Parcel width shall be measured along the right-of-way line of the public road. For parcels abutting more than one public road, parcel width standards shall apply along each public road abutted. For parcels abutting a public road that cannot derive access from that road, an easement for vehicular access and utility placement, connecting all such parcels to a public road, shall be provided at the time of parcelization. 
(c)  Parcels not abutting a public road. For parcels that do not abut a public road, the minimum parcel width shall be in accordance with the requirements of Tippecanoe County Code Chapter 41 or its successor, "The Private Sewage Disposal Ordinance of Tippecanoe County." For each such parcel, either a front lot line and all necessary setbacks or a building setback of 25 feet from all property lines, shall be included either on the drawings or recorded as a covenant. An easement for vehicular access and utility placement, connecting all such parcels to a public road, shall be provided at the time of parcelization. (Ord. No. 3-00, § 1) 
(d)  Sewage disposal. Each parcel shall be served either by sanitary sewer or on-site sewage disposal system. If the property to be parcelized is located within the Cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette, or the Towns of Dayton and Battle Ground, parcels may not be served by an individual sewage disposal system. If the property to be parcelized is located outside these incorporated cities and towns and a sanitary sewer system from within an incorporated city or town abuts that property, parcels shall then be subject to the provisions of section 41-3-F of the Tippecanoe County Code. Where such service is unavailable (outside the indicated incorporated cities and towns either within or beyond area served by these systems), on-site sewage disposal systems that meet the standards of Tippecanoe County Code Chapter 41 shall be required. 
(e)  Right-of-way. If a parcel abuts a public road along which full right-of-way width has not yet been obtained, the land divider shall, by appropriate instrument, convey to the public sufficient right-of-way for one-half the required width for that specific road (as indicated in the thoroughfare plan for Tippecanoe County or its successor), for the full width of that parcel along that roadway. 
(f)  Conflict with public provisions. The provisions of section [101.0]3.5 are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provisions of law. Where any provisions of this subsection impose restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control, unless otherwise stated herein. 
(g)  Public improvement. Any proposed division of land necessitating the creation or extension of a public improvement shall not qualify as a parcelization. 
(h)  Saving provision. All parcelizations approved prior to the effective date of this amendment to the unified subdivision ordinance shall remain valid. 
(4)  Documentation. 
(a)  Sewage disposal. If the property to be parcelized is located outside the Cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette or the Towns of Dayton and Battle Ground but within an area served by a sanitary sewer system from an incorporated city or town, the land divider shall submit written documentation from the appropriate service provider as to whether sanitary sewer would be available for use. If such service is unavailable, or if the property is located beyond the areas served by the systems, the land divider shall provide written documentation that the county board of health has been satisfied that the standards of Tippecanoe County Code Chapter 41 have been met to assure the continued operation or the proper installation of an on-site sewage disposal system on each parcel. 
(b)  Right-of-way. If additional right-of-way is required as per section [101.0]3.5(3)(e), the land divider shall submit the appropriate conveyance, with a legal description prepared by a registered land surveyor, conveying such right-of-way to the appropriate jurisdiction. Conveyances shall be prepared in a format available at the Office of the commission and shall be signed by the land owner and notarized. 
(c)  Easements for private drives. Should the land divider at the time of parcelization provide an easement for a private drive connecting parcels to a public road, the land divider shall submit ten copies of the description of that easement prepared by a registered land surveyor, and signed by all owners and notarized. Where applicable, a statement shall be appended to each legal description of each parcel as follows: "This parcel is subject to an easement for ingress and egress recorded in Record _____, Page _____." Should the land divider choose to submit parcelization drawings, the description should appear on the face of the drawings. An additional statement must accompany any such easement description indicating that private driveways constructed in these easements shall not be accepted for maintenance by any participating jurisdiction. 
(5)  Private driveways. The construction and maintenance of private driveways built to provide access to parcels shall be the responsibility of the owner or owners of the land. These driveways shall not be accepted for maintenance by participating jurisdictions. A private driveway may be named by the land divider, provided the name is approved by the commission's staff, as not duplicating, or too closely approximating phonetically, the name of any other street whether public or private, in the area covered by this ordinance. A sign indicating the name of the private driveway only may be erected, provided that the sign is not constructed with white letters on a green background, and is not constructed using any other format or color scheme used by a participating jurisdiction to identify a publicly maintained street or road. The words "private drive" shall be placed after the name. Placement of the sign shall be approved by the county highway engineer or appropriate city engineer or town board at the time of the driveway permit issuance. 
(6)  Review, approval and recordation. 
(a)  An application for parcelization shall not be considered complete until all items in sections [101.0]3.5(2) and [101.0]3.5(4) have been submitted to the commission's staff. Within three working days of the submission of the completed application, the commission's staff shall review all items and notify the land divider as to their compliance or deficiencies with regard to all requirements of section [101.0]3.5. 
(b)  Upon a finding of compliance, the executive director or his designee shall sign all ten sets of legal descriptions or drawings. Once signed, the approved parcelization is eligible to be recorded. 
(c)  It shall be the responsibility of the land divider in the presence of the executive director or his designee to file the approved parcelization with the county auditor and recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure to so file and record shall automatically invalidate the approval, rendering it null and void and requiring resubmittal for approval. 
(d)  The actual location, shape, size and boundaries of a parcel established by a recorded parcelization shall not be changed, altered, added to or reduced by any provision, exempt division or exemption provided for in this ordinance except by dissolution of the parcelization or a parcel thereof under section [101.0]3.5(7) of this ordinance. (Ord. No. 11-96) 
(7)  Dissolution. 
(a)  A recorded parcelization or portion thereof may be dissolved by the property owner or owners if, in doing so, no provision of this or any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute or provision of law is violated. To do so, ten copies of a statement dissolving the parcelization (or any part of it) shall be submitted to staff for review of compliance with above-stated ordinances, rules, etc. This statement, signed by all legal owners, contract buyers, and optionees of the property and notarized, shall contain the parcelization number and legal descriptions of the parcels involved. 
(b)  Upon a finding of compliance, the executive director or his designee shall sign all ten statements. Once signed, the approved dissolution is eligible to be recorded. 
(c)  It shall be the responsibility of the land divider in the presence of the executive director or his designee to file the approved dissolution with the county auditor and Recorder within 30 days of the date of signature. Failure to so file and record shall automatically invalidate the approval, rendering it null and void and requiring resubmittal for approval. 
(d)  Upon recording the dissolution statement, the land owner is once more eligible to pursue the full parcelization process as per section [101.0]3.5 of this ordinance. That is, the land involved, for purposes of land division, is restored to its preparcelization status. 
(8)  Creating new building sites over approved parcels. 
(a)  Tracts zoned residential, commercial or industrial, which were the subject of one or more prior recorded parcelizations may be included in a major subdivision. Such major subdivision shall be proposed by the owner or owners of all land included therein, and may be proposed without dissolving the prior parcelization. Upon recording the major subdivision, all lot lines, covenants, restrictions, building restrictions and easements which were a part of the parcelization, whether created at the time of or subsequent to the parcelization either by deed or operation of law, shall be revoked and be void. Any right-of-way granted or dedicated to the public under section [101.0]3.5, or any easement utilized by a utility, providing access and/or drainage rights shall not be revoked or voided. 
(b)  Parcels which were the subject of an approved and recorded parcelization and on which no building site remains, may be combined with other such parcels and/or unparcelized tracts to create new tracts qualifying under the exemption A provision of the definition of subdivision. Provided, however, that all such exempt tracts created contain only land from the original parent tract. (Ord. No. 3-00, § 2; altered in 2019 recodification) 
Sec. 101.04. - ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS 
Sec. 101.04.1. - Improvements and performance bond. 
(1)  Completion of improvements. Before any final plats are submitted for secondary approval, all applicants shall be required to complete in accordance with primary approval, construction plan approval and this ordinance, all the streets, sanitary sewers, and other public improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision. 
(2)  Performance bond. 
(a)  The commission in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete all public improvements prior to the submission of the final subdivision plat, and that, in lieu thereof, the applicant shall post bond securable to Tippecanoe County, hereinafter referred to as performance bond, in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements, which shall be sufficient to secure to the participating jurisdiction the satisfactory construction and installation of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements, as provided for in sections [101.0]3.3(7)(a)(i) and [101.0]3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance. 
(b)  That in lieu of such a bond, the developer may submit a certified check made payable to Tippecanoe County in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided for in sections [101.0]3.3(7)(a)(i) and [101.0]3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance. Any such check shall be held by the county auditor. 
(c)  That in lieu of such a bond the developer may submit irrevocable letters of credit in behalf of the developer and securable by Tippecanoe County in an amount equivalent to 100% of the estimated cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided for in sections [101.0]3.3(7)(a)(i) and [101.0]3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance. In the event an irrevocable letter of credit is utilized, it shall be written for a maximum length of two years and the commission, two months prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, shall determine if the public improvements have been accepted for maintenance by the governmental unit having jurisdiction over the public improvement, and if they have not been accepted shall so notify the subdivider of intent to secure the funds and then commence procedures to secure the funds pledged by such letter of credit, or at the discretion of the commission to grant an extension for such period fixed by the commission, not to exceed one year, and the subdivider filing with the commission a new letter of credit for the period so fixed. 
(d)  That in lieu of such a bond, the subdivider may submit a certificate of deposit made out to either Tippecanoe County and/or the developer, to be held by the county auditor and in an amount equivalent to 100% of the cost of completion of the uncompleted portion of required public improvements as provided for in sections [101.0]3.3(7)(a)(i) and [101.0]3.4(8)(a)(i) of this ordinance. If the subdivider is named singly or jointly on such certificate, then the developer must, before submitting it to the commission, endorse it so that the county may secure the funds. (Ord. No. 11-96) 
(e)  Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the commission attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in this ordinance. See Appendix A for forms. The period within which required public improvements must be completed may be specified by the commission in the primary approval and shall be incorporated into the bond. Bonds shall not in any event exceed two years from date of secondary approval. Such bond shall be approved by the participating jurisdiction as to amount. The commission may, upon proof of difficulty, grant an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year, provided that the bond submitted for this extension period meets all other requirements herein. The commission may, at any time during the period of such bond, accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond. 
(3)  Temporary public improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary public improvements required by the commission as requested by the participating jurisdiction and shall maintain same for the period specified by the commission. Prior to construction of any temporary public facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the commission a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 
(4)  Cost of public improvements. All required public improvements shall be made by the subdivider, at his expense without reimbursement by the participating jurisdiction or any public improvement district therein, unless sharing of expenses is agreed upon by the participating jurisdiction. 
(5)  Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bond provisions apply may file, in lieu of said bond, a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section. 
(6)  Failure to complete public improvements. For subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed within five years of the date of primary approval, that approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond, the participating jurisdiction may thereupon request the county to declare the bond to be in default and cause all public improvements to be installed according to primary approval and construction plan approval regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default. 
(7)  Acceptance of dedication offers. The secondary approval by the commission of a final subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the participating jurisdiction of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat. The commission may require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The acceptance is that of only the real property itself. 
Sec. 101.04.2. - Inspection of public improvements. 
(1)  General procedure. If the participating jurisdiction finds, upon inspection per sections [101.0]3.3(7)(a)(ii) and [101.0]3.4(8)(a)(ii), that any of the improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the public improvements according to such plans. Where the cost of the public improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the public improvements according to specifications. 
(2)  Release or reduction of performance bond. 
(a)  Certificate of satisfactory completion. The participating jurisdiction shall not accept required public improvements, nor the commission release nor reduce a performance bond, until the participating jurisdiction has submitted a certificate stating that all required public improvements or a pro rata part in the case of a reduction have been satisfactorily completed. The applicant's engineer or surveyor shall provide the participating jurisdiction with detailed "as built" construction plans of the public improvements, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the commission or participating jurisdiction. Upon such certification, the participating jurisdiction shall thereafter accept the public improvements for maintenance in accordance with the established procedures. 
(b)  Reduction of performance bond. A performance bond shall be reduced upon actual acceptance of public improvements and then only by the amount originally estimated for the completion of said public improvements. 
Sec. 101.04.3. - Maintenance of public improvements. 
(1)  The subdivider shall be required to maintain all public improvements on the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of said public improvements by the participating jurisdiction. 
(2)  The subdivider shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the commission, prior to acceptance, in an amount not to exceed ten percent of the cost of all public improvements, and in a form satisfactory to the commission attorney, in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the required public improvements, for a period of three years after the date of their acceptance by the participating jurisdiction. 
Sec. 101.04.4. - Waiver of required public improvements. 
    The commission may defer or waive at the time of primary approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such public improvements as in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities. 
Sec. 101.04.5. - Issuance of building permits. 
    No building permit shall be issued for the last ten percent of lots in a final recorded subdivision plat or section thereof, or if ten percent be less than two, for the last two lots of a subdivision or section thereof, until all public improvements required by the commission for the plat with the exception of sidewalks have been fully completed and accepted for maintenance by the participating jurisdiction. 
Sec. 101.05. - REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, RESERVATIONS AND DESIGN. 
Sec. 101.05.1. - General improvements. 
(1)  Applicable standards. Whenever a participating jurisdiction, its utility system or any privately-owned utility system have performance standards adopted pursuant to statute in existence or have them subsequently adopted, they shall apply in lieu of similar standards that may be contained within this ordinance. The standards adopted by the Tippecanoe County commissioners as utilized by the Tippecanoe County Highway Engineer for urban street cross sections shall be the standards utilized within the corporate boundaries of Battle Ground and Dayton until such time as they adopt separate standards. In differentiating between urban and rural cross sections within subdivisions, an urban cross section shall be utilized within the urbanized area as defined by the Bureau of the Census and a rural cross section may be utilized outside of this area except where the Tippecanoe County Board of commissioners, upon advice of the County Highway Engineer, deems an urban cross section is necessary due to proximity to the urbanized area or due to the nature of the site itself. 
(2)  Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the standards established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following laws, rules and regulations: 
(a)  All applicable statutory provisions; 
(b)  The unified zoning ordinance for Tippecanoe County, building and housing codes, and all other applicable laws of the participating jurisdictions, all as adopted by ordinance of such participating jurisdiction; 
(c)  The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the Health Department and/or appropriate state agencies. 
(3)  Covenants. If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the unified zoning ordinance, such restrictions or reference thereto may be required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the commission may require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the county recorder in a statutory form to be approved by the commission. 
(4)  Plats straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to the subdivision is required across land in another government jurisdiction, the commission shall request assurance from the local government attorney of that other government jurisdiction that access is legally established, and from that other participating jurisdiction that the access road is adequately improved, or that performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access road. Lot lines shall be laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines. 
(5)  Boundary improvements. 
(a)  The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a registered land surveyor, concrete monuments, four inches square or in diameter and 40 inches long with an iron pipe cast in the center, at each corner or angle of the ultimate outside boundary. They shall be set following grading of each phase of the subdivision. 
(b)  The subdivider shall have placed, under the supervision of a registered land surveyor, pipes or steel rods, three-fourths inch in diameter by 30 inches in length at the corners of each lot. These shall be set prior to the issuance of any improvement location permit. 
(6)  Character of the land. Land which the commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision because of flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the commission to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. 
(7)  Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered by this ordinance. The commission shall have final authority to approve the name of the subdivision which shall be determined at the time of primary approval. In the event the developer intends to develop the subdivision in phases, the name of the subdivision shall incorporate by number and as necessary the respective phase, section and part in that order. 
(8)  Cost sharing. In certain instances it is to be the benefit of the general welfare that certain improvements within a subdivision be increased in size. The additional cost for such is of no special benefit to the future residents of such subdivision but is of benefit to the general public. In such events, special contractual arrangements for cost sharing may be entered into between the developer and the participating jurisdiction, public utility or governmental agency involved. 
Sec. 101.05.2. - Lot improvements. 
(1)  Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the unified zoning ordinance or greater standards provided for by any ordinance of a participating jurisdiction which relates lot size to a particular condition or circumstance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the commission may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in compliance with the unified zoning ordinance and this ordinance. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. 
(2)  Double frontage lots and access to lots. 
(a)  Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided in residential subdivisions except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
(b)  Access from primary and secondary arterials. Lots in residential subdivision shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a primary or secondary arterial. Where driveway access from a primary or secondary arterial may be necessary for several adjoining lots in both residential and nonresidential subdivisions, the commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access or frontage road in order to limit a possible traffic hazard on such street. Where possible, driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on primary or secondary arterials. 
(3)  Soil preservation, grading, seeding. 
(a)  Soil preservation and lot grading. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until rough lot grading as it applies to drainage for that lot, has been accomplished in accordance with the approved construction plans. Topsoil shall not be removed from a residential subdivision lot after the pad grade has been established, but shall be redistributed on the lot and between the curbs and sidewalks in conformance with the site grading plan. It shall be the responsibility of the lot owner to maintain the lot grade, as it applies to drainage, as provided for in the approved construction plans. 
(b)  Lot drainage and seeding. The grading plans shall provide positive drainage away from all lot pads and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general stormwater drainage from each lot to adjacent lots both upstream and downstream as shown in the site grading plan in conformance with the overall stormwater management plan for the area. Where appropriate and when required by the commission, the seeding and mulching, or sodding, of drainageways shall be included as part of the erosion control program. 
(c)  Debris and waste. No cut trees, debris, junk, rubbish, or other similar waste materials shall be buried by the developer on any lot or street in the subdivision, unless on-site disposal is provided for as shown in the approved construction plans. 
(d)  Water bodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a water body other than a temporary detention facility or portion thereof, lot lines shall either be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots, or the commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No part of the minimum area of a lot required under the unified zoning ordinance may be satisfied by land which is under water other than a temporary detention facility or portion thereof. 
Sec. 101.05.3. - Roads. 
(1)  General requirements. 
(a)  Frontage on improved roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing street on the official map, or if there be no official map, unless such street is: 
(i)  An existing state, county, or local highway; or 
(ii)  A street either shown upon a plat approved by the commission and recorded by the county recorder, or recorded by the county recorder prior to February, 1965. Such street or highway must be suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulations, specifications, or orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under this ordinance. 
Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage, the half of the road fronting the subdivision shall be suitably improved as provided herein. 
(b)  Grading and improvement plan. Roads shall be graded and improved in accordance with the construction plans approved herein. 
(c)  Topography and arrangement. 
(i)  All streets shall be integrated with the existing and proposed systems of thoroughfares and dedicated street right-of-way as established on the official map and/or comprehensive plan. 
(ii)  All thoroughfares shall be properly related to specific traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
(iii)  Minor or local streets should be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 
(iv)  The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout. 
(v)  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. 
(vi)  In nonresidential subdivisions, the streets and other access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
(d)  Blocks. 
(i)  Blocks in residential subdivision shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be permitted. 
(ii)  In long blocks, the commission may require the reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, or drainage facilities. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks may be required by the commission at some point in blocks more than 800 feet long, where deemed essential, to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities. 
(e)  Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the commission may require that access to such streets be limited by one or more of the following means: 
(i)  The subdivision of residential lots so that they back onto the primary arterial and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be permitted to the primary arterials from any lots, and screening may be required in a planting strip inside the rear property line of such lots; 
(ii)  A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the primary arterial; 
(iii)  A marginal access or service road, i.e. a perimeter street, separated from the primary arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points; however, marginal access or service roads shall generally be discouraged in residential subdivisions. 
(f)  Road names. The sketch plan as submitted shall indicate names upon any proposed streets. The commission shall, at the time of primary approval, specify the names of all roads in order to avoid duplication. The local postmaster shall be consulted by the commission prior to rendering its approval. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the several participating jurisdictions so as not to cause confusion. A road which is, or is planned as, a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name. 
(g)  Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such street unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless in the opinion of the commission, the access from adjacent property to such street is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout for the most advantageous future development of such adjacent tracts. 
(h)  Construction of roads and dead-end roads. 
(i)  Construction of roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation is in accordance with the thoroughfare plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property lines, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for coordination of the layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. A temporary T- or L-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to the abuttors whenever the street is continued. The commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards of these regulations. 
(ii)  Dead-end roads. Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the commission for access to adjoining property, its right-of-way terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with participating jurisdiction construction standards and specification. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of this ordinance. 
(2)  Design standards. 
(a)  General. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the design standards for public roads indicated in Table 1 on file in the office of the city clerk are hereby required. Road classification may be indicated by the thoroughfare plan; otherwise, it shall be determined by the commission. 
(b)  Road surfacing and improvements. [The] subdivider shall construct all required curb and gutters and shall surface, or cause to be surfaced, roadways to the widths pursuant to approved construction plans. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted by ordinance of the participating jurisdictions or as approved by the applicable local unit of government through its board of works, town board or board of county commissioners, or as provided for in this ordinance, and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer prior to secondary approval. 
(c)  Excess right-of-way. Right -of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in this ordinance shall be required whenever, because of topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess of a ratio of two to one. 
(d)  Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
(i)  In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
(ii)  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad should, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
(iii)  Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
(e)  Intersections. 
(i)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the commission. 
(ii)  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual roadways without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect arterials and collectors, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersections of arterials with collectors shall be at least 800 feet apart. 
(iii)  Minimum corner radius at the intersection of two local streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum corner radius at an intersection involving a collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practices to permit safe vehicular movement. 
(iv)  Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practicable. At the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than three percent rate at a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. 
(v)  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance. 
(vi)  The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be three percent or less. 
(f)  Bridges. The sharing of expense of construction of bridges shall be fixed by special agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the applicant per section [101.0]5.1(8). 
(3)  Road dedications and reservations. 
(a)  New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his own subdivision boundaries. 
(b)  Widening and realignment of existing and proposed arterials and roads. Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening an adjacent road that would require use of some land in the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate such areas for widening or realignment of such roads. Where any lots within a major subdivision derive frontage from any such road, it shall be improved to one-half of the full width of a collector facility as required by this ordinance. If the site is transected by an existing arterial which the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate right-of-way for such arterial. Where any lots within a major subdivision derive frontage from any such arterial, it shall be improved to the full width of a collector facility as required by this ordinance. Where an arterial proposed in the comprehensive plan or thoroughfare plan borders or transects a proposed subdivision, the necessary right-of-way shall be reserved as provided for in section [101.0]5.9 of this ordinance. 
Sec. 101.05.4. - Drainage and storm sewers. 
(1)  General requirements. As a part of the approved construction plans, the subdivider shall submit plans for the approval of the commission for an adequate stormwater drainage system, which may include sewers, channels, and basins. The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed according to accepted engineering practice, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with construction plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across any intersection, nor for a distance in the gutter greater than that indicated by the design computations submitted with the construction plans. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block. 
(2)  Nature of stormwater facilities. 
(a)  Location. The subdivider may be required by the commission to carry away, by pipe or open ditch, any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way, where feasible, or in unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans. 
(b)  Accessibility to public storm sewers. Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the subdivider shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of stormwaters as shown on the approved construction plans. Inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the participating jurisdiction. 
(c)  Effect on downstream drainage areas. The participating jurisdiction shall study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Local government drainage studies, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the commission may withhold primary approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said potential condition. No subdivision shall be granted primary approval unless positive drainage shall be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility, either on- or off-site. 
(3)  Floodplains and areas of poor drainage. 
(a)  Areas of flooding soils. Areas which are not in the floodplain but contain soils which are subject to flooding may be approved for subdivision by the commission, provided that the subdivider fills the affected areas of said subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place building sites and streets two feet above pending levels. 
(b)  Areas of high seasonal water tables. In areas characterized by soils having a high seasonal water table as determined by the Tippecanoe County Soil and Water Conservation District, lots shall be limited to slab type construction unless the commission determines that appropriate engineering techniques will be applied to alleviate the subsurface problem. 
(c)  Floodway areas. If a subdivision of land is proposed within the floodplain, floodways shall be preserved and not diminished in capacity by filling or obstruction, except as approved by the natural resources commission in writing. No residential building site may be located within the floodway. 
(d)  Floodway fringe areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area of the floodplain designated as a Floodway Fringe, the commission may approve such subdivision provided that: all streets are elevated sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood; all lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade two feet above the regulatory flood elevation; where provided, water and sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of or by, floodwater; and, approval to fill the area from the natural resources commission has been obtained in writing. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for computing the area requirement for any lot. 
(e)  Floodplain areas. Where a subdivision is proposed within an area of the floodplain for which floodway and floodway fringe designations have not been made, the commission shall not approve such subdivision unless: all streets are elevated sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood; all lots for residential usage have a flood protection grade of two feet above the regulatory flood elevation; where provided, public water and sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of, or by, floodwater; and filling to achieve the above will not raise the level of the regulatory flood more than one-tenth of one foot for that reach of the stream. All filling in the floodplain must be approved in writing by the natural resources commission. Lands below the regulatory flood elevation shall not be used for computing the area requirement for any lot. 
(f)  Recording of plats in the floodplain and floodway fringe. All final plats having within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below that of the regulatory flood shall show and label the regulatory flood boundary and elevation, as of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final plat for recording. 
Sec. 101.05.5. - Water facilities. 
(1)  General requirements. 
(a)  Where a public water main is readily accessible, the subdivider shall install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) as shown in the approved construction plans. 
(b)  To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants and all water supply improvements shall be shown on the preliminary plat. 
(2)  Individual wells and central water systems. If a public water system is not available, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the health department for its approval, and individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the commission. 
(3)  Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions except those having lots served by individual wells. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any structure and shall be approved by the applicable fire protection unit. The actual placement of the hydrants shall be approved by the supplier of the water in cooperation with the affected fire department. 
Sec. 101.05.6. - Sewerage facilities. 
(1)  General requirements. The subdivider shall install sanitary sewerage facilities in a manner prescribed by the construction standards and specifications of the participating jurisdiction. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules, regulations, and standards of the participating jurisdiction, health department, and appropriate state and federal regulating agencies. Plans shall be approved by the above agencies where required by those agencies. 
(2)  Sanitary sewerage system requirements. Where provided, sanitary sewerage facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewerage systems, and shall be installed to serve each lot and to grades and sizes required by approving officials and agencies. Sanitary sewerage facilities (including the installation of laterals in the right-of-way) shall be subject to the specifications, rules, regulations, and guidelines of the health officer, participating jurisdiction, and appropriate state agency. 
(3)  Individual disposal system requirements. If the public sewer facilities are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot areas shall conform to the requirements of the unified zoning ordinance and any ordinance of any participating jurisdiction establishing lot areas for individual sewerage disposal systems. 
Sec. 101.05.7. - Sidewalks. 
(1)  Required improvements. 
(a)  Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated non-pavement right-of-way of all roads with urban cross sections being improved by the subdivider as shown in Table 2. 
TABLE 2. REQUIRED SIDEWALKS WITH URBAN CROSS SECTION 
ROADWAY TYPE STANDARD WIDTH ALL RESIDENTIAL 
(Place, Local Road, Collector, Arterial) 4 ft. NON-RESIDENTIAL: Local Road, Collector 4 ft. Arterial. 6 ft.  
(b)  Concrete curbs are required for all roads where sidewalks are required by this ordinance and all intersections shall be ramped to enhance accessibility. 
(c)  Sidewalks shall be improved as required in section [101.0]5.3(2)(b) of this ordinance. A median strip of grassed or landscaped areas at least two feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs. 
(2)  Pedestrian accesses. The commission may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements or dedications. Easements or dedications shall be indicated on preliminary and final plats. 
Sec. 101.05.8. - Utilities. 
(1)  Location. All utility facilities, including, but not limited to, gas, electric power, telephone, and CATV cable, shall be located underground throughout the subdivision, except where not permitted by the utility. All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat. Underground service connections to the property line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider's expense. 
(2)  Easements. Easements centered on lot lines other than front lot lines shall be provided for utilities (private and municipal) and drainage; such easements shall be at least ten feet wide. Where such easements are provided on front lot lines, or on side lot lines immediately adjacent to rights-of-way, they shall be ten feet wide measured from the lot line. Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the establishment of utility easements in adjoining properties. Easements shall be indicated on preliminary and final plats. 
Sec. 101.05.9. - Parks, playgrounds, recreation areas and other community facilities. 
(1)  Reservation review requirements. In the review of subdivisions, the commission shall give consideration to the needs and requirements for the following open space uses and community facilities, including, but not limited to: 
(a)  Parks based upon the standards recommended in the land use and recreation plans; 
(b)  School sites, other public and semi-public buildings and facilities and locations for water supply systems, sewage treatment facilities and drainage facilities, and proposed thoroughfares, in accordance with local and regional land use, recreation and thoroughfare plans. 
(2)  Reservation for open spaces and community facilities. Where open space uses or community facilities shown in the land use, recreation and thoroughfare plans are located in whole or in part within the subdivision, the commission may require the reservation of such area as may be deemed reasonable for such purposes. 
(3)  Referral to public body. The sketch plan shall be referred to the public body concerned with the reservation for its consideration and report as per section [101.0]3.2(2) of this ordinance. The public body or agency shall have 45 days for reply indicating its official action in writing. The public body or agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a copy of the sketch plan showing the boundaries and area of the land to be acquired and an estimate of the time within five years required to complete the acquisition. 
(4)  Notice to property owner. Upon receipt of a report, the commission shall notify the property owner and, in the event of an affirmative report, shall designate on the preliminary and final plats that area proposed to be acquired by the public body. 
(5)  Duration of land reservation. Failure on the part of the public body or agency to acquire or initiate condemnation within the prescribed five years shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and the freeing of the property for development in accordance with these regulations. 
(6)  Maintenance of reserved land. The maintenance of land reserved under the provisions of this ordinance shall at the time of primary approval become the responsibility of the public body for whom the reservation has been made unless mutual agreement to waive this requirement has been reached between the subdivider and the public body or agency. This requirement shall remain in effect as long as the reservation shall be in effect. 
Sec. 101.05.10. - Preservation of natural features and amenities. 
(1)  General. Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the participating jurisdiction as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved wherever possible, in the design of the subdivision. 
Sec. 101.05.11. - Nonresidential subdivisions. 
(1)  General. It is recognized that the subdivider, in creating a nonresidential subdivision, faces problems of lot design not normally encountered in residential subdivisions. For this reason, the initial emphasis of the commission shall be upon street layout and block arrangement. The procedural requirements for sketch plan and for primary approval are as provided in section 101.03 except that the subdivider need show only the proposed street and block layout. 
    Subsequently, as prospective buyers or users express interest in lots sized to their required specifications, the subdivider may then submit for secondary approval a final subdivision plat or plats which may show lot lines other than those shown at time of primary approval in the case of a major subdivision and sketch plan in the case of a minor subdivision. The procedural requirements of the commission following the receipt of a final subdivision plat shall then apply, except that where public improvements were built following a previously approved set of construction plans, public improvements then need not be reconstructed because of the adoption of new criteria by a participating jurisdiction. This shall also apply to storm drainage facilities within said subdivision unless runoff characteristics are to be changed, or in the event that unauthorized existing improvements have altered conditions. 
(2)  Standards. 
(a)  Nonresidential subdivisions must be appropriately zoned for business or industry prior to the proposal for a subdivision under this section. 
(b)  If a nonresidential subdivision has received secondary approval, any replatting of lots may take place following the minor subdivision provisions of this ordinance. There shall be no limit on the number of minor subdivisions within the original plat. 
(c)  All nonresidential subdivisions shall be served by approved sewer and water facilities, by individual wells, on-site sewage disposal facilities, or some combination thereof as approved by the appropriate authorities. 
Sec. 101.05.12. - Multi-family subdivisions. 
(1)  General. Unless otherwise excluded under section A of the definition of subdivision, or under the provisions for parcelization indicated in section [101.0]3.5 of this ordinance, the development of more than one multi-family structure on a single ownership lot constitutes a subdivision of land as defined herein. Yet the creation of a separate lot for each principal use building, that is, each multi-family structure, poses unique and complex problems for the subdivider of land to be so used. Many of the standards set forth in the unified zoning ordinance to be applied to individual residential lots cannot be met without destroying the unifying concept of a well-designed complex of multi-family structures. Most notable among these standards are lot size, frontage and setback requirements, all of which assume a progression of uniform lots along a roadway, more typical of single family and some duplex developments. Despite these difficulties associated with the subdivision of land for multi-family development, the purposes of this ordinance, as listed in section [101.0]1.3, must be met. Thus, with regard to proposed multi-family subdivisions, the emphasis of the commission shall be on the number of principal use buildings, the number of proposed dwelling units and required parking spaces, and the provision of required public improvements. To this end, the necessity of placing interior lot lines on sketch plans and preliminary and final plats shall be at the subdivider's option, so long as all principal use buildings and all accessory buildings remain in the ownership or leasehold of a single entity. That option shall be revoked at such time as the ownership or leasehold of fewer than all such buildings is to be transferred to another entity. Such transfer shall necessitate a resubdivision of the affected property, complete with appropriate lot lines. 
(2)  Procedural requirements and submission specifications. 
(a)  Multi-family subdivisions must be appropriately zoned for multi-family structures prior to the proposal for a subdivision under this section. 
(b)  The subdivider of land to be used for the development of multi-family structures shall adhere to the procedural requirements and submission specifications for sketch plans and preliminary and final plats as provided in sections [101.0]3 and [101.0]6 of this ordinance, except as follows: 
(i)  The number of principal use buildings, and the number of proposed dwelling units and required parking spaces shall be indicated on sketch plans and preliminary and final plats; 
(ii)  The subdivider may opt to omit interior lot lines under the circumstances indicated in section [101.0]5.12(1); and 
(iii)  No multi-family subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing street on the official map, or if there be no official map, unless such street is: 
(A)  An existing state, county, or local highway or a street either shown upon a plat approved by the commission and recorded by the county recorder, or recorded by the county recorder prior to February, 1965. Such street or highway must be suitably improved and accepted for public maintenance, or be secured by a performance bond required under this ordinance. Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage, the half of the road fronting the subdivision shall be suitably improved as provided for in section [101.0]5.12(3)(a)(i) or section [101.0]5.12(3)(a)(ii) as follows; or 
(B)  A street platted as a part of the multi-family subdivision. 
(c)  Should the subdivider exercise the option of omitting interior lot lines, the standards of the unified zoning ordinance shall be applied to the entire tract. That is, the entire tract will be treated as one lot, subject to all restrictions and requirements of the unified zoning ordinance pertaining to multi-family dwellings on a single lot. In effect, this will permit the placement of more than one principal use building on a single lot. Should there be a necessity to resubdivide, as would occur in the event of a transfer of ownership or leasehold of fewer than all principal use and accessory buildings, the standards of the unified zoning ordinance for multi-family dwellings shall be applied to each and every separate lot so created through the resubdivision process; variances may be sought from the appropriate board of zoning appeals. 
(3)  Requirements for improvements. 
(a)  The subdivider of land to be so used for the development of multi-family structures shall be subject to the requirements of section [101.0]5 of this ordinance, except as follows: 
(i)  Widening and realignment of existing and proposed arterials. Where a multi-family subdivision borders an existing narrow arterial or when the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening an adjacent arterial that would require use of some land in the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate such areas for widening or realignment of such arterials. Where any portion of a multi-family subdivision abuts any such arterial, that arterial shall be improved only to one-half of the full width of a collector facility as required by this ordinance. If the site is transected by an existing arterial which the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate right-of-way for such arterial. Where any portion of a multi-family subdivision abuts any such arterial, that arterial shall be improved to the full width of a collector facility as required by this ordinance. Where an arterial proposed in the comprehensive plan or thoroughfare plan borders or transects a proposed subdivision, the necessary right-of-way shall be reserved as provided for in section [101.0]5.9 of this ordinance. 
(ii)  Widening and realignment of existing and proposed collectors and local roads. Where a multi-family subdivision borders an existing narrow collector or local road or when the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening an adjacent collector or local road that would require use of some land in the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate such areas for widening or realignment of such collectors or local roads.

Those parts of the Airport Zone, established by this ordinance for any public-use airport, which lie generally below the flight path of aircraft approaching or taking off from the runways of such airport and, specifically, below the defined airport reference surfaces: the airport approach surface, the airport primary surface and the airport transitional surfaces.
AIRPORT APPROACH SURFACE. A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the airport primary surface of a public-use airport. An AIRPORT APPROACH SURFACE is applied to each end of each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. The following also applies to the AIRPORT APPROACH SURFACE:
(1)
The inner edge of the AIRPORT APPROACH SURFACE is the same width as the airport primary surface and it expands uniformly to a width of the following:
(a)
1,250' for that end of a runway with only visual approaches;
(b)
1,500' for that end of a runway other than an airport utility runway with only visual approaches;

4,000' for that end of an airport nonprecision instrument runway, other than utility, having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as 3/4 of a statute mile;
(f)
16,000' for airport precision instrument runways.
(2)
The AIRPORT APPROACH SURFACE extends for a horizontal distance of the following:
(a)
5,000' at a slope of 20:1 for all airport utility and visual runways;

INTENT: To provide areas for new, detached, medium and relatively high density zerolot-line (ZLL) single-family dwellings, served by sanitary sewers. This configuration moves the outdoor focus from the rear to the side of a lot. It requires one larger side setback, rather than two smaller ones. A larger side setback, in concert with a suitably designed interior, maximizes the functional, private outdoor space of a relatively small residential lot.

(c)
An atrium along the shared side lot line, enclosed on 3 sides by the dwelling, shall be enclosed along that lot line by a solid wall, at least 8' high, built of the same material as the outside of the dwelling.
(d)
An offset along the shared side lot line, at either the front or rear of the dwelling, shall also be enclosed along that side lot line by a solid wall, at least 8' high, continuous with and built of the same material as the outside of the dwelling. This wall shall extend along the side lot line the full length of the offset.
(e)
Closure shall be provided for the required non-ZLL side setback, at the front setback, along at least 75% of the width of the side setback. This closure shall be 3-5' high, and may consist of a wall, or solid fence, or continuous landscape material. In addition, for a corner lot with a required non-ZLL side setback that abuts a street, this same kind of closure shall be provided along at least 50% of the length of the street side setback.
(f)
Along the shared side lot line, continuous with the rear of the dwelling (or the end of its rear offset wall) a solid wall, at least 8' high and built of the same material as the outside of the dwelling, shall be extended an additional 6'.
(g)
To better integrate the dwelling's interior and exterior spaces, one or more doors shall be provided which open directly onto the required non-ZLL side setback from rooms other than the garage or storage or utility areas. Two options are available:
(1)
at least one door, if it is part of a window and door assembly at least 8' wide, which can be seen through substantially from top to bottom; or
(2)
at least 2 doors, other than the kind described in (1), from 2 different rooms.

INTENT: To provide areas identified within the adopted Comprehensive Plan as having either highest or a combination of high and highest potential for agricultural use, where no urbanization has occurred, and which are to be reserved for the wide range of agricultural activities and the homes primarily of those engaged in such activities and of their families.
2-25-2
BOUNDARIES: Boundaries for AA zones have been drawn to include substantial areas having either highest or a combination of high and highest potential for agricultural use. These potentials have been determined by applying the Land Use Potentials decision-making matrix, used to generate the Phased Land Use Plan within the Comprehensive Plan for Tippecanoe County (adopted September 16, 1981). The methodology is described in Volume 1 of the Comprehensive Plan, the Phased Land Use Plan in Volume 2. When a petitioner applies to rezone AA-zoned land to permit a non-agricultural or related land use, the Commission's staff shall reapply this methodology to the petitioner's site. This will determine what proportion of the site actually has less than high potential for agricultural use. This new information shall then be included in the staff's written report to the Commission. The Commission will then use the information in making its recommendation.

2-27-2 BOUNDARIES: (Amend 56)
(a) Flood Plains exist adjacent to all natural and manmade watercourses, regardless of contributing drainage area or whether they have been defined or mapped. All land in a flood plain below the regulatory flood elevation (Amend 5) shall be contained in an FP zone. Boundaries of FP zones are shown on the official zoning maps
as approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)
Division of Water and reflect the best available information. Each specific FP zone may not be shown on the zoning maps because of a lack of information and detailed studies. Inconsistencies in an FP zones boundary may also occur because of previously approved flood certifications which are not shown on the zoning maps.
(1) In instances where there is a lack of information and detailed studies, the boundaries of the FP zone shall be established on an individual basis for land development by using a regulatory flood elevation authorized by either the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources (IDNRs) Division of Water or the Executive Director
per UZO 2-27-17.
(2) Areas previously certified out of an FP zone that remain above the current regulatory flood elevation shall be incorporated by reference as being out of the official FP zone.

2-27-4 USES AND STRUCTURES PERMITTED WITHIN A REGULATORY FLOODWAY: (Amend 56) Approval in writing from IDNRs Division of Water is required for any work in the regulatory floodway portion of the flood plain as is a local improvement location permit. A local improvement location permit will not be issued until IDNRs Division of Water approval has been received; state approval does not guarantee the issuance of a local improvement location permit. All new improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. Anchoring shall be certified by a Professional Engineer (PE) or Licensed Architect prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance except when waived by the Administrative Officer. Uses and structures permitted within a regulatory floodway are as follows:
(a)
primary uses: see 3-2;

existing written documentation from IDNRs Division of Water (IDNR),
a petitioner seeking to establish or change the boundaries of the FP zone described in 2-27-2-a above, shall provide the Executive Director with a scaled map of the property and a metes and bounds legal description. The base flood elevation on the FIRM map is equivalent to the regulatory flood elevation. The Executive Director shall then determine the regulatory flood elevation from the current FIRM map or best available written documentation from IDNR. In addition to establishing or changing the FP boundary on the zoning map, petitioner must also submit a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) or other required application to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to change the FIRM.
(b) If advised by the Executive Director that there is no current FIRM map or other written documentation that includes the base flood elevation at the property in question, a petitioner seeking to establish or change the boundaries of the FP zone, shall provide IDNR with the
necessary information per IDNRs requirements. IDNR shall then
determine the regulatory flood elevation and floodway location for the property on the official zoning maps.

When seeking to establish or change the boundaries of FP zone described in 2-27-2-b above, the regulatory flood boundary in these small drainage basins may be adjusted by the Executive Director, upon written request, to the limits of the alluvial soils as verified by a Soil Scientist and mapped and certified by a Registered Land Surveyor (RLS). The mapped and certified area shall be considered as being the regulatory floodway.
(d)
The Executive Director may establish or change the boundary of the FP zone upon a petitioner providing:
(1)
a written request that the FP boundary be changed;
(2)
a letter from either IDNRs Division of Water or the Executive Director or their designee containing a regulatory flood elevation;
(3)
a metes and bounds legal description of that portion of the property situated at, above or below the regulatory flood elevation determined by 2-27-17-a or 2-27-17-b above or that portion of the property containing alluvial soils per 2-27-17-c above, certified by a Registered Land Surveyor (certification statement required per Appendix H).

(e)
An area of land removed from an FP zone through the process outlined in 2-27-17-c or 2-27-17-d above, shall take on the zoning of adjacent areas on the zoning map. Where adjacent areas are characterized by more than one zone, the line dividing those zones shall be extended through the land being removed from the FP zone. These are exceptions:
(1)
An area in the floodway that is filled to an elevation at or above the regulatory flood will still be considered part of the floodway, and shall retain its FP zoning.
(2)
If an island of land is certified as having natural ground elevation at or above that of the regulatory flood and is in the floodway fringe and adjacent to no zone other than an FP zone, it shall be zoned AW.
(3)
An area removed from an FP zone that is situated next to land previously removed from an FP zone shall derive its zoning from that previously removed land only if no other adjacent land is present.
(4)
APD zone shall not be considered an adjacent zone for purposes of assigning a new classification to an area removed from an FP zone. Land removed from an FP zone, situated next to no zone other than PD and FP, shall be zoned AW.

Reclassification of land to some zone other than FP in and of itself provides no guarantee that an improvement location permit can be issued for any specific proposed use.
(g)
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this ordinance does not create any liability on the part of Tippecanoe County, Lafayette, West Lafayette, Battle Ground, Clarks Hill, Dayton, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully hereunder.
(Amend 65)
2-27-18 ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS: (Amend 56)
To prevent harm to lands within or determined to be within the FP zone:
(a)
The lowest floor elevation, including basements and crawl spaces, of buildings permitted in adjoining zones on land within 100' of an FP zone shall comply with the flood protection grade; compliance shall be demonstrated on FEMAs elevation certificate;
(b)
Water wells, water lines and sewage facilities located within a flood plain shall be constructed to eliminate contamination of or by floodwater;
(c)
Clearcutting trees in the FP zone shall be prohibited.
(d)
Because trees and other vegetation help decrease erosion, lower water temperatures, capture pollutants and stabilize the velocity of flood waters, removing trees in the FP zone shall be limited to the following situations:
(1)
Trees found to be dead or hazardous by a certified arborist, the IDNR District Forester, or an employee of the Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), or the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).
(2)
As necessary for construction; repair or maintenance of public roads; or utilities or drainage structures.
(3)
As part of an approved forestry operation meeting the standards of SIC 0811 that has approved tree protection, management and regeneration plans prepared by a certified arborist; or the IDNR District Forester; or an employee of the SWCD; the USDA; or the NRCS.

(e) Peninsulas created of suitable fill material shall be permitted within a floodway fringe, and may be permitted within a regulatory floodway as per 2-27-4 above. However, islands created of fill material shall not be permitted. The addition of suitable fill is subject to the following:
(1)
For sites larger than 1 acre along watercourses with a drainage area equal to or greater than one square mile, no encroachment or addition of suitable fill within the floodway fringe or the regulatory floodway shall result in a loss of flood plain storage. Before receiving a fill improvement location permit, written documentation that the project complies with the adopted stormwater ordinances must be provided to the Administrative Officer; or
(2)
For sites less than 1 acre along watercourses or larger sites with a drainage area less than one square mile, no encroachment or addition of suitable fill within the floodway fringe or the regulatory floodway may increase the base flood elevation for that reach of stream more than one tenth of one foot. Before receiving a fill improvement location permit, documentation showing compliance shall be required in writing from IDNRs Division of Water for floodways or by certification from a Professional Engineer for the floodway fringe and for small drainage basins.
(f) (Additionally, if a residential or nonresidential building is to be constructed on suitable fill that raises the elevation of land out of the floodway fringe, the fill shall be placed in layers no greater than 1 deep before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard Proctor Test method. This procedure shall be certified by a Professional Engineer (Amend 41 & 56).
(g) The addition and compaction of suitable fill shall precede all on-site digging. (Amend 41).

2-28 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONES
PD PD
2-28-1 INTENT:
(a)
PD zoning may be used to foster innovative and diverse design in land development that is still consistent with both the adopted Comprehensive Plan and the intent of the Unified Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances. To achieve this, the Commission does not apply any other provisions of this chapter or Chapter 4 below. Instead, the Commission --through its staff --negotiates a specific development plan with the petitioner for PD zoning and representatives of the checkpoint agencies. The combined elements of this negotiated plan --rather than zone regulations --then become the subject of the rezoning process. All restrictions and regulations for a specific Planned Development are thus contained within the approved and recorded plan itself, having been arrived at prior to rezoning. PD zoning may be applied to existing development or to open land, on small or large tracts.
(b)
The Commission's goal is to provide a widening variety of environmentally appropriate residential, nonresidential and mixed-use developments to meet the needs of this community. To help create attractive, healthful, efficient and stable places to live, shop and work, the Commission encourages use of PD zoning within the following contexts:
(1)
to
accommodate
compatible development
in
environmentally
sensitive locations;
(2)
to enhance compatibility with surrounding land uses;
(3)
to
permit
a
harmonious
variety
of
uses
within
a
single
development;
(4)
to promote efficiency and thus economy by clustering structures and/or by using shared facilities or services;
(5)
to foster new site treatments not contemplated in other kinds of zones.
2-28-2 ORIGINATION OF PROPOSALS:
(a)
A request to rezone from any other zoning classification to PD may be initiated by:
(1)
all owners of the property in question; or
(2)
any group of owners united in interest, acting jointly in pursuance to an agreement to carry out the proposal in separate ownership.
(b)
Because of the unified design of a planned development and because the combined elements of the negotiated plan are the substance of the zone itself, this ordinance requires that a request to reclassify from PD to PD shall include amongst the petitioners either:
(1) all owners of the property within the current planned development; or
Chapter 2 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 105
2-28 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONES, contd.
PD PD
(2) the owners' association acting on behalf of a majority of property owners in the current planned development, as constituted in the recorded bylaws.
(c) Also, in keeping with provisions of 5-2-3 below, PD zoning is mandatory for any new condominium construction or condominium conversion.
2-28-3 CLASSIFICATION OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS:
(a) To identify the nature of planned developments on zoning maps, they shall be classified as one of these four zones:
(1)
PDRS, in which all buildings and land are developed for residential use and those activities customarily accessory to residential use;
(2)
PDNR, in which no buildings or land are developed for residential use, but rather for commercial and/or industrial and/or recreational and/or some other nonresidential use;
(3)
PDMX, in which buildings and land are developed as a mix of both residential and nonresidential uses; and
(4)
PDCC, in which the only change proposed involves either:
(A)
the conversion to condominium ownership of a development which has received occupancy permits for all parts no less than three years prior; or
(B)
the conversion to condominium ownership of an existing building in a CB or CBW zone or in a PD zone adjoining or surrounded by a CB or CBW zone;
where there is no further division of land involved.
(b) Those PD zones and overlays approved prior to the adoption of this amendment shall be reclassified as one of the above four zoning categories.
2-28-4 PRE-SUBMISSION CONFERENCE:
(a)
No pre-submission conference is required before submitting a rezoning request to PDCC.
(b)
Before submitting any of the materials required for a rezoning request to either PDRS, PDNR or PDMX, the petitioner shall arrange a meeting with staff and the appropriate Administrative Officer, and if outside the corporate limits of Lafayette and West Lafayette, the County Surveyor and Highway Executive Director, or their designees (Amend 15). If outside the service area of sanitary sewer, the County Health Department shall also be notified (Amend 41).
(c)
The petitioner shall bring to this meeting a drawing or sketch of the proposed planned development that:

2-28-11 RECORDING APPROVED FINAL DETAILED PLANS:
(a)
Before performing any development, construction or earth moving activity, or applying for improvement location permits, or filing any required condominium documents, the petitioner shall record approved Final Detailed Plans in the Office of the County Recorder.
(b)
The staff shall accompany the petitioner in the recording process. Final Detailed Plans shall first be stamped and dated at the County Auditor's office, with one set of plans given the County Auditor. The remaining sets of Final Detailed Plans shall then be stamped, numbered and recorded at the County Recorder's office, and then distributed by the petitioner. The staff shall provide the petitioner a list of agencies to which the petitioner shall distribute sets of approved and recorded plans. The petitioner shall keep at least one set.
(c)
If the petitioner fails to record Final Detailed Plans for all or any part of the entire project within 30 days of the date of their approval, that approval expires. In order to continue, the petitioner then shall resubmit Final Detailed Plans for approval, as per 2-28-9 or 2-28-10 above.
(d)
Any construction that does not fully comply with recorded Final Detailed Plans will be subject to appropriate enforcement action as provided for in 6-3-1 below.

constitute a minor modification only, then the changes shall be recorded as an Amended Final Detailed Plan, as per 2-28-11 above.
(1)
This written determination of conformance and minor modification shall be made and signed by the appropriate Administrative Officer, and attached to each copy of the Amended Final Detailed Plans before recording.
(2)
A minor modification cannot include: any increase in residential density; any decrease in residential density of 10% or more; any change in building dimension or location other than within the defined building envelope; any change in landscaping other than substitution of species or redesign with the same materials; any alteration in the size and/or location of signage; any change in type of land use; any change in the alignment or intersection of streets; or any change in restrictive covenants, or horizontal property ownership and owners' association documents regarding these items (Amend 15).
(3)
Submission requirements and a timetable for seeking a determination of conformance and minor modification shall be set by each Administrative Officer.
(4)
Changes beyond the scope of minor modification require rezoning.
(b) For any newly constructed condominium project or attached zerolot-line (ZLL) project, the property owners shall provide exact measurements locating buildings and common lot lines after foundations have been put in place. The revised plat reflecting exact locations needs to be approved and signed by the appropriate Administrative Officer as Amended Final Detailed Plans and recorded as per 2-28-11 above.
2-28-13 LAPSED AND ABANDONED PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS:
(a)
An intended condominium conversion has lapsed if 2 years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDCC was granted, and no Final Detailed Plans have been approved and recorded as per 228-9 and 2-28-11 above. Following such lapse, the Commission shall initiate a petition to rezone the property to its previous classification.
(b)
A planned development has been abandoned if 2 years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDRS, PDNR or PDMX was granted, and no Final Detailed Plans have been approved and recorded for the project or any part or phase of it as per 2-28-10 and 2-28-11 above; or
(c)
Parts or phases of a planned development have been abandoned if 10 years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDRS, PDNR or PDMX was granted, and only Final Detailed Plans for other

parts or phases have been approved and recorded as per 2-28-10 and 2-28-11 above.
(d)
An Administrative Officer cannot issue an improvement location permit for an abandoned planned development or an abandoned part or phase of a planned development. An abandoned planned development or abandoned part or phase shall be rezoned (and if to a PD classification, comply with 2-28-11 above) before the property's owner once more becomes eligible to receive an improvement location permit at that location.
(e)
Neither the Commission nor any legislative body shall initiate a petition to rezone any PD-zoned property unless it has either lapsed or been abandoned.
2-28-14 COVENANTS AND MAINTENANCE:
(a)
To assure property owners that all aspects of a planned development remain in conformance with plans adopted by the legislative body at the time of rezoning, restrictive covenants and any horizontal property ownership and owner's association documents can only be changed through the procedures detailed in 2-28-12 above.
(b)
These changes may be initiated only by a majority of property owners within the planned development. Multiple owners of a single property shall be considered a single owner. The developer shall be considered a single owner until all property is sold.
(c)
The Administrative Officer may determine that these changes constitute a minor modification if they meet the requirements of 2-2812-a-2 above. Changes to these documents which would alter design aspects of the project, or which are determined by the Administrative Officer to be beyond the scope of minor modification require rezoning. Covenants and any horizontal property ownership and owner's association documents must reflect the provisions of this section.
(d)
A planned development containing common facilities shall be provided with an owners' association or other private organization responsible to and controlled by the property owners. This organization's purpose is to ensure adequate operation and maintenance of these common facilities, which may include, but are not limited to private streets, common areas, landscaping, and amenities such as a clubhouse, pool or tennis courts. Recorded legal assurances shall be provided which show this organization to be self-perpetuating.
(e)
All streets and roadways not dedicated to nor accepted by a public agency, and all other common facilities not dedicated to the public, shall be operated and maintained at no expense to any governmental unit.

3 PERMITTED USE TABLE
3-1 PERMITTED USES A table of primary uses permitted in each kind of zone is shown in 3-2 which follows. Only one primary use building is permitted per lot. Within the jurisdiction of this ordinance, the use of land and the buildings and structures on it, and of any new or altered buildings or structures on it, shall conform to the listings of this table.
3-1-1 USES PERMITTED BY RIGHT: A primary use is permitted by right in a zone when the letter P appears in the Permitted Use Table at the intersection of the row containing the name of that use and the column containing the name of that zone. Please note that the permitted use is subject to:
(a)
the off-street auto and bicycle parking requirement referenced in the first column of the row on which the use appears;
(b)
any special conditions referenced in the second column of the row on which the use appears; and
(c)
any footnotes alongside the name of the use.
Requirements for all off-street parking groups listed in the first column are
found in 4-6-3 through 4-6-9 below.
3-1-2 USES PERMITTED BY SPECIAL EXCEPTION: A primary use is permitted by special exception in a zone when the letter S appears in the Permitted Use Table at the intersection of the row containing the name of that use and the column containing the name of that zone. Please note that the permitted use must be granted a special exception by the ABZA as per 6-4-4 below, and is subject to:
(a)
the off-street auto and bicycle parking requirement referenced in the first column of the row on which the use appears;
(b)
any special conditions referenced in the second column of the row on which the use appears; and
(c)
any footnotes alongside the name of the use.
Requirements for all off-street parking groups listed in the first column are
found in 4-6-3 through 4-6-9 below.
3-1-3 ACCESSORY USES AND BUILDINGS: A use or building which is incidental to, and located on the same premises as a primary use, may be permitted as an accessory use or building. Permitted accessory uses and buildings are found in 4-1 below. Also if multiple buildings on the same premises are engaged in the same primary use, all such buildings other than the one housing that uses managing or operating office, shall be considered accessory buildings. Where multiple primary use buildings in single ownership
Chapter 3 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 122
occupy the same premises and are managed or operated from an office in one of those buildings, all such buildings other than the one housing the operating or managing office shall be considered accessory buildings.
3-1-4 USES NOT PERMITTED: If neither a P nor an S appears in the Permitted Use Table at the intersection of the row containing the name of a use and the column containing the name of the zone, then that use is not permitted in that zone.
3-1-5 PERMITTED USES IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONES: Because uses in a PD zone are negotiated and included in the zone itself, the Permitted Use Table in 3-2 below does not apply.
3-1-6 PERMITTED USE TABLE FORMAT:
(a)
Except for the section on residential uses, the Permitted Use Table is organized in conformance with the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual, assembled and published by the federal Office of Management and Budget. The SIC Manual, hereby included by reference, is thus part of this ordinance which shall not be administered without it.
(b)
In this table, nearly every permitted primary use (except for residential uses) is assigned an SIC Group number of either 2, 3 or 4 digits. Four-digit groups are more specific than 3-digit groups, which in turn are more specific than 2-digit groups. For purposes of the Permitted Use Table, each use shall be classified in the most specific SIC Group listed.
(c)
Uses not assigned an SIC Group number are shown in quotes, and are defined in 1-10 above.
(d)
The word except followed by a colon, found directly under many SIC Group numbers, means that any indented listings of specifically named primary uses that follow except: shall be considered separately, and not as part of the listing from which they have been excepted.
(e)
For ease of use, some items in the table have been grouped together because of related functions. Thus trash transfer stations (which might otherwise be found under SIC 4212), and junk yards and scrap and waste material (which might otherwise be found under 5093), have been included below SIC 4953 with other forms of refuse management.
(f)
The major groupings of uses within the Permitted Use Table are as
follows: 3-2-1 Residential Uses 3-2-2 Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing 3-2-3 Mining 3-2-4 Construction 3-2-5 Manufacturing 3-2-6 Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas and Sanitary
Chapter 3 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 123
3-2-7 Wholesale Trade Services 3-2-8 Retail Trade 3-2-9 Finance, Insurance and Real Estate 3-2-10Services 3-2-11Public Administration
3-1-7 PERMITTED USE TABLE ADMINISTRATION:
(a)
Administrative Officers shall determine the appropriate SIC Group for a given use by means of the Permitted Use Table and the SIC Manual. As a further aid, the Alphabetic Index in the SIC Manual lists a 4-digit number for virtually all activities.
(b)
The nature of uses will be as they are defined in the SIC Manual. Exceptions are those permitted primary uses listed in the table in quotes. These are defined in 1-10 above.
(c)
Where the name of a permitted primary use appears in the SIC Manual both as a title next to an SIC Group number and as a listing under that title, the item in the Permitted Use Table refers to the group title and all uses listed below it. It does not refer to the one specific listing below the title that shares its name.
(d)
SIC Major Groups 01 and 02 (Agricultural Production ---Crops, and Agricultural Production ---Livestock and Animal Specialties) are meant to identify primary uses operated for commercial purposes. The introductory paragraphs in the SIC Manual for these 2 groups dealing with classification based on 50 percent or more of the value of sales, are to be disregarded in favor of a measure based on predominant commercial use of the land.
(e)
Primary uses that are neither listed in the Permitted Use Table nor classified in the Alphabetic Index of the SIC Manual, may be permitted by an Administrative Officer in a zone in which similar uses are permitted. The Administrative Officer shall find the characteristics of such an unlisted use to be:
(1)
consistent with the purpose and description of the zone as per Chapter 2 of this ordinance;
(2)
compatible with the permitted uses in the zone; and
(3)
similar in traffic generation, and noise, vibration, dust, odor, glare and heat producing properties.
(f)
Footnotes appearing in the Permitted Use Table are not subject to variance by the ABZA or its division. Doing so would create a use variance, prohibited by state statute (I.C. 36-7-4-916 and 918.3).
(g)
As used in the footnotes to the Permitted Use Table, the word equipment includes trucks, except all pick-up trucks and any other trucks with a hauling capacity up to one ton.

FOOTNOTES TO 4-2-2: 1 Minimum setbacks along street frontages, whether front, rear or side setbacks, depend on the classification of the street which the setbacks abut. See abbreviations above for street classifications. 2 In zones requiring a rear setback, that setback may be reduced --but not to less than 3' for a residential use, 10' for a nonresidential use --by counting ½ the width of an abutting public alley as part of the setback. 3 See 4-4-1 below on setback averaging. 4 Except 25' for a perimeter lot. 5 There can be no setback along the designated zero-lot-line side. The minimum setback along the non-ZLL side is 12', except 17' for a perimeter lot outside the urbanized sewered area. 6 Minimum rear setback for a primary use building is 10? when abutting an R1Z zone; it is 20? abutting any other zone. Minimum side setback for an accessory use building is 6? abutting R1Z, R1U, R2U and R3U zones; it is 10? abutting any other zone. 7 Minimum side setback is 30' if the side lot line abuts a residential zone or use.
(Amend 43)
8 Minimum side setback is 10' if the side lot line abuts a residential zone or use. 9 Minimum rear setback is 40' if the rear lot line abuts a residential zone or use.
(Amend 43) 10 25?, measured as per 2-28-7 above. (Amend 27) 11 Except for South and/or North River Road, the minimum setback from a road for
properties within the urbanized sewered area of West Lafayette is 20? or the average setback on the block face, but never less than 10?. (See 4-4-1 below on setback averaging.) (Amend 37)
12 See 4-4-5 below on setbacks on structural projections and stoops. (Amend 44)
4-3 LOT AREA AND LOT WIDTH
4-3-1 LOTS NOT SERVED BY SANITARY SEWER: As stated in Footnote 1 to the table in 4-2-1, minimum lot areas and lot widths shown are only for primary uses served by sanitary sewer. Minimum lot areas and lot widths for primary uses not served by sanitary sewer:
(a)
shall be as approved by the Tippecanoe County Health Department (and the Division of Sanitary Engineering, Indiana State Department of Health except for single-and two-family residences), on a lot-by-lot basis; and
(b)
shall in no case be less than 30,000 sq.ft.
4-3-2 SUBSTANDARD LOTS: A single-family dwelling, or a nonresidential use may be located on a lot that fails to meet its zone's minimum lot area and/or lot width standards if:
(a)
the use is permitted in the zone by right or by special exception; and
(b)
the zone's lot coverage, setback and building height standards and the use's parking and bufferyard requirements can still be met; and
156 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 4
(c)
the lot is served by sanitary sewer or, within the platted portions of unincorporated Buck Creek, Colburn, Americus, Stockwell, Romney, West Point/Glenhall, Odell and Montmorenci, has been approved for that use by the Tippecanoe County Health Department; and
(d)
The legally created lot was either recorded in separate ownership or included in a recorded subdivision on or before January 2, 1998, the effective date of this ordinance (Amend 18).

4-3-4 LOTS ON WHICH A RESIDENTIAL USE IS CHANGED: A lot on which a residential use is changed by increasing the number of dwelling units, shall meet its zone's lot area and lot width requirements for the higher number of units.
4-4 SETBACKS
4-4-1 AVERAGING SETBACKS ALONG STREET FRONTAGES: For a primary use building, the minimum setback along a street frontage is reduced to the average setback of the existing primary use buildings on that block face (but never less than 10') if:
(a)
the frontage is along any street in an R1U, R2U or R3U zone, or along any local street in any other zone requiring a setback along a street frontage, or along any street in an R3W or R4W zone (except North and South River Road) located within the urbanized sewered area of West Lafayette (Amend 37); and
(b)
at least half the lots in that block face are already occupied by primary
use buildings. Any primary use building being removed to make way for a new primary use building cannot be included when calculating average setback along a street frontage for that new building.
4-4-2 SETBACKS FOR MULTIPLE-FRONTAGE AND NON-FRONTAGE LOTS:
(a)
A corner lot has just one front setback and one front lot line, as defined in 1-10.
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 157
(b)
A through lot has just one front setback marked by one front lot line, as defined in 1-10, if the two abutting streets are classified differently in the street classification system. Unless deed restrictions specify otherwise, the lot line abutting the street classified lower in the street classification system shall be designated the front lot line; it marks the front setback. The lot line abutting the higher classified street shall be designated the rear lot line; it marks the rear setback. The street classification hierarchy from lowest to highest is: place, local street, collector street, secondary arterial, primary arterial.
(c)
A through lot has two front setbacks marked by two front lot lines, as defined in 1-10, if both streets it abuts are classified the same in the street classification system.
(d)
For a lot without street frontage, the minimum front setback is 25', measured from a lot line designated as the front lot line.
4-4-3 LOCATIONS WITH SPECIAL SETBACKS:
(a)
The setback for primary use and accessory buildings from the right-of-way of North River Road (SR43 north of the Harrison Bridge) is 100':
(1)

(3)
except for those lots located on the east side of North River Road, south of the Harrison Bridge. (Amend 48)
(b)
The setback from rivers, streams and other bodies of water for primary use and accessory buildings is 25', measured horizontally from the Flood Plain zone boundary and certified by a Registered Land Surveyor. This setback applies to all new construction begun after the adoption of this section, other than attached additions to existing structures either built in compliance with an improvement location permit, or built before 1965.
4-4-4 SETBACKS FOR PORCHES, DECKS AND PATIOS (Amends 16, 16A, 47):
(a)
If roofed and not attached to a primary use building, a porch, deck or patio is an accessory building; it shall observe all minimum setbacks for accessory uses, structures and buildings prescribed in the table in 4-22 above.
(b)
If roofed and attached to a primary use building, a porch, deck or patio is part of that primary use building and not an accessory building; it shall observe the minimum setbacks for primary use buildings prescribed in the table in 4-2-2 above.
(c)
Whether attached to a primary use building or not, an unroofed porch, deck or patio is an accessory structure; it may extend into a minimum rear setback to within 4? of a lot line if:
158 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 4
(1)
its
floor
within
the
setback
is
no
higher
than
30 above
its
underlying grade; (Amend 47) and
(2)
it is not enclosed higher than 3½' above that floor.
4-4-5 SETBACKS FOR STRUCTURAL PROJECTIONS AND STOOPS:
(a)
The following structural projections may extend up to 2' into a minimum front, rear or 6? side setback and no more than 1? into a minimum 5? side setback where permitted: eaves, overhangs, bay windows, greenhouse windows, window wells, window-mounted or wall-mounted air conditioners, fascia brick and exterior siding.

(2)
the lot on which it is situated meets all requirements of 4-3-2 above.
(c)
Required parking is permitted in the front setback in any residential or RE zone when it is used as a drop-off for a child care home on that same lot (Amend 27).
(d)
Required parking is permitted in the front setback in any zone when it accommodates a home occupation within a dwelling on that same lot.
(e)
Neither required nor optional parking is permitted in any no-parking setback. Except where crossed by driveways, a no-parking setback cannot be covered with impervious surface, and is subject to landscape requirements of the jurisdiction in which it is located. Regarding the development of multi-family dwellings, the no parking setback pertains only to the perimeter of the development, and not to any internal lot lines (Amend 5).
(f)
No parking space shall be located between a building and the right-ofway line of any adjoining street in NBU, MRU, CB or CBW zones, except at sites surrounded on three sides or more by streets. If surrounded on three sides by streets, parking may be located between a building and one adjoining street right-of-way line. If surrounded on four or more

This triangular vision setback is measured along the curbs of the 2 intersecting streets, or the edge of their pavements if there are no curbs. The distance from the corner of the intersection shall be 40' in each direction; a diagonal connecting those two 40' line segments closes the triangle.
(b)
A vision setback shall also be provided for all lots located at alley/street intersections in all zones except CB, CBW and NBU. This triangular vision setback is measured along the curb of the intersecting street (or pavement edge if there is no curb) and the pavement edge of the intersecting alley. The distance from the corner of the intersection shall be 20' in each direction; a diagonal connecting those two 20' line segments closes the triangle.
(c)
A vision setback shall also be provided for both sides of driveway/street intersections in all zones, for all primary uses required to provide 5 or more parking spaces. This triangular vision setback is measured along the curb of the intersecting street (or pavement edge if there is no curb) and the pavement edge of the intersecting driveway. The distance from the corner of the intersection shall be 20' in each direction; a diagonal connecting those two 20' line segments closes the triangle.
4-4-8 SETBACKS FOR OPEN USES:
(a)
The minimum setback for any open use, other than those listed in 4-4-8a-1 below, is 5' from the front lot line, plus 5' from any side or rear lot line abutting a street or a residential or RE zone (Amend 27). Except where crossed by driveways, an open use setback cannot be covered with impervious surface, and is subject to landscape requirements of the jurisdiction in which it is located.

4-6 PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
4-6-1 PURPOSES AND INTENT: To reduce traffic problems and hazards, every permitted use shall provide enough on-site parking spaces to accommodate the number of motor vehicles and bicycles that ordinarily are attracted to that use. This provides additional traffic lanes for major streets, provides more traffic capacity on major streets, allows faster emergency access, and allows narrower local streets to be designed within subdivisions. Secondary purposes include: minimizing development problems with neighboring uses; providing for special parking needs for individuals with disabilities and bicyclists; providing adequate parking for all uses; and, allowing flexibility in meeting the community's parking needs.
4-6-2 REQUIRED PARKING SPACES:
(a)
(LAFAYETTE, WEST LAFAYETTE, DAYTON, BATTLE GROUND, CLARKS HILL) The following 7 tables indicate the minimum number of on-site parking spaces that shall be provided for residents, guests, employees and customers. The tables in 4-6-3 and 4-6-7 correspond to the parking group numbers and letters that appear in the first column next to every use in the Permitted Use Table (3-2 above). A parking group number alone is a reference to 4-6-3, automobile parking. A parking group number followed by a slash and a parking group letter, is a reference to first 4-6-3, automobile parking, and then 4-6-7, bicycle parking. Note that for West Lafayette's university-proximate residences, the table in 4-6-4 supersedes 4-6-3, and the table in 4-6-8 supersedes 4-6-7. For integrated centers having gross leasable areas

(d)
The parking needs of individuals with disabilities shall be met according to the requirements of 4-6-6 above, including the provision of parking spaces and access aisles along an accessible route.
4-6-14SETBACKS FOR AUTO PARKING: (Amend 7)
(a)
Except in 4-6-14-b through 4-6-14-d below, required parking is not permitted in the front setback of any residential use, or any residential zone (Amend 13). Optional parking is also not permitted in the front setback of any residential use, except in driveways and turnarounds.
(b)
A single-family dwelling may have one of its 2 required parking spaces in a driveway or turnaround in its front setback (but not under roof) if:
(1)
its lot area and lot width do not exceed the minimums for R1B zones; or
(2)
the lot on which it is situated meets all requirements of 4-3-2 above.
(c)
Required parking is permitted in the front setback in any residential zone when it is used as a drop-off for a child care home on that same lot.
(d)
Required parking is permitted in the front setback in any zone when it accommodates a home occupation within a dwelling on that same lot.
(e)
Neither required nor optional parking is permitted in any no-parking setback. Except where crossed by driveways, a no-parking setback cannot be covered with impervious surface, and is subject to landscape requirements of the jurisdiction in which it is located. Regarding the development of multi-family dwellings, the no parking setback pertains only to the perimeter of the development, and not to any internal lot lines (Amend 5).
(f)
No parking space shall be located between a building and the right-ofway line of any adjoining street in NBU, MRU, CB or CBW zones, except at sites surrounded on all sides by streets. (Amend 69)
(g)
For all permitted uses other than single-and two-family dwellings, parking spaces may be located in a required front setback in NB, OR, MR, GB, HB, I1, I2 and I3 zones. However, these parking spaces cannot be placed within any no-parking setback, 4-6-14-e above, nor any vision setback, 4-4-7 above.

(a)
All auto parking spaces, maneuvering spaces and maneuvering aisles shall be paved, except in A, AA, AW, FP and RE zones (Amend 27) and on farms in any zone, where paving is optional. (However, mobile home
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 173
parks in A zones shall also have paved auto parking spaces, maneuvering spaces and maneuvering aisles.) Paving shall be either bituminous pavement or portland cement concrete, or an alternative dustfree, durable and cohesive surface such as paving blocks or brick. Such alternative surface shall not be hazardous to pedestrians and shall be traversable by individuals with disabilities. Parking surfaces shall be kept in good condition (free from potholes, etc.) by the owner of the land.
(b)
For all primary uses other than single-and two-family dwellings (including any home occupation authorized therein), auto parking space width and length, maneuvering aisle width and parking angle shall be measured as per the diagram in Appendix C
(c)
The dimensional requirements for auto parking spaces are as follows:
(1)
Each off-street auto parking space required in 4-6-3 through 4-6-5 above shall consist of a rectangular area no less than 9' wide and 18' long, except 8' wide and 22' long for each parallel (0°) parking space.
(2)
For all permitted uses other than single-and two-family dwellings (including any home occupation authorized therein), each paved auto parking space shall be delineated by striping or other means acceptable to the Administrative Officer. Parking space striping shall be kept clearly visible and distinct.
(3)
Accessible parking spaces shall be at least 8' wide and 18' long, and shall have an adjacent access aisle at least 5' wide. "Van accessible" parking spaces shall be served by an access aisle at least 8' wide. These access aisles shall be part of an accessible route to the building or facility entrance. Two accessible parking spaces may share a common access aisle. An alternative to the provision of a percentage of spaces with 8'-wide access aisles, and the associated requirement in 4-6-6-b above to include additional signage, is the allowance of "universal" parking space design. Under this design, all accessible parking spaces are 11 feet wide and 18' long with a 5 foot access aisle.
(d)
For all permitted uses other than single-and two-family dwellings (including any home occupation authorized therein):
(1)
Each required off-street auto parking space shall open directly on an unobstructed maneuvering aisle, the width of which is determined by the parking angle (measured between the centerline of the maneuvering aisle and the centerline of the parking space), as shown in 4-6-15-d-2.
174 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 4

A paved alley abutting auto parking spaces may be counted toward the required maneuvering aisle width.
(3)
Driveways shall be arranged for the free flow of vehicles at all times. All maneuvering spaces and maneuvering aisles shall be designed so that all vehicles can exit from and enter onto a public street by being driven forward.
(e)
Plans for driveway improvements within public right-of-way are subject to the approval of the applicable local unit of government, or the Indiana Department of Transportation if along a State or Federal roadway.
(f)
Wheel stops, low walls, or other physical barriers shall be provided for all parking area boundaries (except at points of ingress and egress), so that parked vehicles do not extend into adjacent properties, no-parking setbacks or public rights-of-way. These barriers shall not reduce the clear width of an accessible route for individuals with disabilities. Parking areas shall be designed so that maneuvering vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or bump against or damage walls, vegetation, or other obstructions.
(g)
"Van accessible" and "universal" parking spaces shall provide a minimum vertical clearance of 98" at the parking space and along at least one vehicle access route to such parking spaces from parking area entrance(s) and exit(s).
(h)
Lighting requirements and restrictions for auto parking areas are intended to promote nighttime security while minimizing negative impacts. No parking area lighting shall be so intense or brilliant as to impair the vision of drivers, pedestrians or employees, or disturb the daily activities of adjoining or neighboring residents. These requirements and restrictions are as follows:
(1)
Lighting used to illuminate an auto parking area shall be shielded, placed or otherwise designed to direct light toward the parking area surface, and away from adjacent residences and public streets.
(2)
The outdoor parking area associated with a multi-family dwelling shall be illuminated from 30 minutes after sunset until 30 minutes before sunrise (Amend 13).
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 175
(3)
If open after sunset, the outdoor parking area associated with any other use shall be illuminated from 30 minutes after sunset until 30 minutes after closing, or until 30 minutes before sunrise if the use operates all night (Amend 13).

(a)
The bicycle parking spaces required by 4-6-7 through 4-6-9 shall consist of racks or other stationary objects approved by the Administrative Officer, to which bicycles can be locked by securing the frame and at least one wheel. Such a facility must be usable with both U-locks and cable locks. These types of facilities may be substituted:
(1)
lockers, which consist of fully enclosed parking spaces accessible only to bicycle users;
(2)
a check-in parking system, where bicycles are delivered to and left with an attendant with provision for identifying bicycle users; stored bicycles are accessible only to the attendant;
(3)
monitored parking, which provides facilities within an area under constant surveillance; and
(4)
restricted access parking, which provides facilities within a locked room or enclosure accessible only to users of bicycles parked inside.
(b)
Bicycle parking facilities shall provide at least 2' of clearance on one side of each bicycle to permit users to lock bicycles to the facility. This space may be shared by adjacent bicycles.
(c)

4-6-17BICYCLE PARKING FOR PRE-EXISTING USES: Primary uses which predate the adoption of this section may convert one auto parking space to bicycle parking upon approval of the Administrative Officer. These converted bicycle parking spaces shall conform to the design standards of 4-6-16 above.
4-6-18OFF-STREET LOADING:
(a)
The Administrative Officer shall determine the need for loading berths to be provided for newly erected or substantially altered buildings which receive or distribute materials or merchandise by truck, up to the maximums shown in 4-6-18-a-1 below.
(1) MAXIMUM LOADING BERTH REQUIREMENTS (4-6-18-a-1):
SQUARE FEET OF GROSS FLOOR AREA
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF OFF-STREET LOADING BERTHS REQUIRED
0 -10,000 10,001 -40,000 40,001 -80,000 80,001 -120,000 120,001 -160,000 160,000+
1 2 3 4 5 5 + 1 for up to each 80,000 over 160,000
(b)
Unless certified by the Administrative Officer under 4-6-18-c below, required off-street loading berths shall be located on the same lot as the use to be served. No portion of any vehicle using the loading berth shall project into a street or alley. No permitted or required loading berth shall be located within 25' of the nearest street intersection, nor shall it be located in a required front, side or no-parking setback adjoining a street.
(c)
In NBU, CB, and CBW zones, the Administrative Officer may certify that there is a designated street or alley loading zone within 130' of the development. In that case, no off-street loading berth need be provided. However, if no off-street loading berth is provided, all pick-ups and deliveries shall be made using the certified street or alley loading zone.
(d)
Except in CB and CBW zones where this subsection does not apply, the Administrative Officer shall determine how off-street loading berths are to be screened from adjacent residential zones or uses, employing one or more of the following means:
(1)
a dense planting of evergreen plant materials which attain a mature height of at least 6'; or
(2)
an opaque 6' fence; or
(3)
landscaped earth berms.
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 177
(e)
The Administrative Officer shall determine the appropriate dimensions for required off-street loading berths up to the following maximums:
(1) off-street loading berths designed for tractor-trailers, no more than: 14' wide by 60' long; maneuvering apron of 60' (giving a total
depth of 120?); and vertical clearance of 15'; and
(2) off-street loading berths designed for single-unit trucks, no more than: 12' wide by 30' long; maneuvering apron of 30' (giving a total
depth of 60?); and vertical clearance of 12'.
(f)
The Administrative Officer shall determine the appropriate mix of required loading berths for tractor-trailers and single-unit trucks.
(g)
Off-street loading berths shall be designed with appropriate vehicular access to a street or alley, and in a way which will least interfere with other traffic movements.
(h)
Off-street loading berths and maneuvering aprons shall be paved, except in A, AA, AW, and FP zones, where paving is optional. Paving shall be either bituminous pavement or portland cement concrete, or an alternative dustfree, durable and cohesive surface such as paving blocks or brick.
(i)
Spaces allocated for use as off-street loading berths shall not be used to satisfy any off-street parking requirement.
(j)
Except when located at a loading berth, semi-trailers, with or without wheels, or other containers, shall not be parked at retail establishments in commercial zones, unless they are attached to semi-tractors (Amends 8, 13.)
4-7 ENTRANCES
(a)
The number, location, placement, separation and design of entrances connecting permitted uses to all public streets is as determined on a case-by-case basis by:
(1)
the City Engineers of the Cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette;
(2)
the County Highway Department Executive Director for unincorporated Tippecanoe County;
(3)
the APC Executive Director for the Towns of Dayton, Battle Ground and Clarks Hill; and
(4)
the Indiana Department of Transportation for state highways; unless their jurisdiction over entrances has been specifically set aside by recorded plat, or by document recorded by a governmental agency.
(b)
The appropriate jurisdiction shall approve the request for such entrances (and issue a driveway permit if that is its procedure), prior to issuing any improvement location permit under 6-2 below for the proposed activity.
178 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 4
4-8 SIGNS
4-8-1 INTENT:
(a)
A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this section.
(b)
These sign regulations are intended to:
(1)
encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
(2)
maintain and enhance the community's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth;
(3)
improve pedestrian and traffic safety;
(4)
minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property;
(5)
enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions;
(6)
establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this section;
(7)
allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the primary use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this section, but without a requirement for permits; and
(8)
prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this section.
4-8-2 COMPUTATIONS:
The following principles control the computation of sign area and sign setback:
(a)
The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) is computed as the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or triangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the entire message, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when that fence or wall otherwise meets ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(b)
The sign area for a sign with more than one face is computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. Where 2 identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, and where such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not farther apart than half the length of the sign, the sign area is computed by the measurement of one of the faces. (Amend 20)
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 179
(c)
The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a sign-lot is computed as per 4-8-3-b for the zone in which the lot is located. For lots fronting on 2 or more streets, the area of all individual signs permitted on each frontage is computed separately for each frontage, but the total is applicable throughout the sign-lot.
(d)
The setback of any freestanding sign shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way to the leading edge of that sign. It shall never be measured to the pole supporting that sign unless the pole is located at the leading edge.
(e)
In situations where uses are constructed beyond a public or private frontage road that runs approximately parallel to a primary or secondary arterial, all measurements of setbacks, road speed, etc. that are required in the following tables shall pertain to the primary or secondary arterial not the frontage road.
4-8-3 SIGNS ALLOWED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH AND WITHOUT PERMITS:
(a)
Signs are allowed on private property, only in accordance with the table in 4-8-4, and within the further requirements of 4-8-3-b below. In 4-8-4, where the letter "A" appears at the intersection of a row containing the name of a sign type and the column containing the name of a zone, that sign type is allowed in that zone without a permit. Where the letter "P" appears for a sign type in a row, that sign type is allowed in the zone represented by the intersecting column, but only with prior approval of a sign permit; special conditions may apply in some cases. Where the letter "N" appears for a sign type in a row, that sign type is not allowed in the zone represented by the intersecting column under any circumstances.
(b)
Signs designated in 4-8-4 by an "A" or a "P" are then allowed, but only if:
(1)
the sum of the area of all building and freestanding signs on the sign-lot conforms to the maximum permitted sign area as determined for the zone in which the lot is located, as specified in the table in 4-8-5;
(2)
the number, area, size and setback of signs on the sign-lot conform to the requirements of the table in 4-8-6 which establishes permitted sign dimensions for freestanding signs. Setback is always measured from the edge of the right-of-way to the leading edge of the sign;
(3)
the maximum permitted building sign area for primary uses within integrated centers is 5 sq.ft of signage per 1,000 sq.ft of floor area, with a minimum building sign area of 40 sq.ft. up to a maximum of 400 sq.ft.; (Amend 20)
(4)
the sum of the area of all integrated center signs conforms to the requirements of the tables in 4-8-7-b. Setback is always measured from the edge of the right-of-way to the leading edge of the sign; and (Amend 20)
180 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 4
(5)
characteristics of the signs conform with the requirements of the table in 4-8-8. (Amend 20)
(c)
Outdoor advertising signs are the subject of 4-8-10 below. They are subject to the requirements of 4-8-4 below, but not to those in 4-8-5 through 4-8-8.
(d)
Rural outdoor signs are the subject of 4-8-12 below. Other than the provisions of 4-8-2(a) and (b), 4-8-4, 4-8-12, and 4-8-15 the provisions of 4-8-2 through 4-8-18 do not apply to rural outdoor signs (Amend 29).
(e)
Gateway signs are subject to the requirements of 4-8-4 and 4-8-15 below and 4-4-7 above, but not to 4-8-5 or 4-8-6. No more than two signs are permitted at any one entrance, and shall be located within either a sign or landscape easement, or a platted outlot. (Amend 40)
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 181
4-8-4 PERMITTED SIGNS BY TYPE AND ZONE: Any primary use with a street-level entrance may display a building sign up to 1 sq.ft. in area indicating its address, and if a residence, the occupant's name. Permission for additional signage is based on the following :

4-8-5 MAXIMUM SIGN AREA PER SIGN-LOT, BY ZONE: (Amend 20) The maximum total sign area for a sign-lot (except for building marker signs, gateway signs, incidental signs, flags and event oriented signs which are exempt from this section), is calculated using the following table. It is determined for each street frontage along a private or public road by multiplying the appropriate zonal base rate by the road speed limit factor, the building setback factor, and the percent of permitted freestanding sign area used. A sign-lot's maximum total sign area is then the calculated sum of the sign areas for all street frontages, unless that sum falls below the sign area assurance or above the sign area cap noted on the following page. Except as indicated in 4-8-6 below regarding freestanding signs, the total sign area may be applied at any location on a sign-lot. See 4-8-7 below for maximum sign area for primary uses within integrated centers and for integrated center signs. Notes follow on the next page. A worksheet can be found in Appendix D.

SIGN AREA ASSURANCE = the zonal base rate, except for: (1) primary use buildings with more than 15000 sq.ft. of ground floor area in NBU and MRU zones; and (2) primary use buildings with more than 20000 sq.ft. of ground floor area in all other commercial and industrial zones, where it equals 0.2% of the ground floor area of the primary use building.
SIGN AREA CAP = 6% of the ground floor area of the primary use building in situations where the calculated maximum sign area per sign-lot exceeds 6% of the ground floor area of the primary use building.
FOOTNOTES TO 4-8-5: 1 This is the legal speed limit along the full length of a sign-lot's street frontage. Where a sign-lot has no actual street frontage, this is the legal speed limit of the adjoining road from which the primary use derives vehicular access, at that access point. Where a sign-lot fronts on a public or private frontage road, the speed limit of the thoroughfare pertains, not that of the frontage road. In an HB zone, where a sign-lot is located within 400? of a primary arterial, fronts on and derives its only access from a local road which in turn derives its access from a primary arterial, then the speed limit of the primary arterial  where the local road intersects --pertains. Where the legal speed limit changes along the length of a sign-lot's street frontage (or between access points for sign-lots having no street frontage), road speed limit is the greater of the speed limits along the length of the street frontage
(or at the number of access points if there is no street frontage). Frontage along I-65 is not counted in this
calculation. If the legal speed limit is increased after signage has been installed, maximum sign area may be
increased accordingly. If the speed limit is decreased, no decrease in signage is required. Where a temporary
speed limit has been posted during a period of construction, the legal speed limit prior to that period will be used for this calculation. (Amend 20) 2 Measured from the edge of the right-of-way of the road along which the sign-lot has street frontage, to the nearest exterior wall or canopy of the primary use building on the sign-lot. Where a sign-lot has no actual street frontage, measured from the edge of the right-of way of the road from which the primary use derives vehicular access to the primary use building on the sign-lot. Where a sign-lot fronts on a public or private frontage road, the setback from the thoroughfare pertains, not the setback from the frontage road. 3 As a percentage of the total area of freestanding signage permitted in 4-8-6 below.

The maximum permitted building sign area for primary uses within integrated centers is based on 5 sq.ft of signage per 1,000 sq.ft. of floor area, with a minimum building sign area of 40 square feet up to a maximum of 400 square feet. (Amend 20)
(b)
MAXIMUM TOTAL SIGN AREA FOR INTEGRATED CENTER SIGNS (4-8-7-b): (Amend 20 and 67) The maximum total sign area for integrated center signs is calculated using the following table. It is determined for each public street frontage by multiplying the appropriate zonal base rate by the integrated center ground floor area factor and the road speed limit factor. An integrated center's maximum total sign area is then the calculated sum of the sign areas for all public street frontages. The total sign area of an integrated center may be applied to one sign at any location at the integrated center. (Amend 20) If the integrated center has more than one frontage, the total amount of signage may be divided between no more than two signs, provided the classification of at least one of the roads is a collector street abutting non-residential uses. Freestanding integrated center signs shall observe the maximum height and minimum setback standards in 4-8-6 above;
ZONAL BASE RATE INTEGRATED CENTER ROAD SPEED LIMIT1 sq.ft. X GROUND FLOOR AREA FACTOR (Amend 20) X FACTOR (Amend 20)
NBU MRU = 30 MR NB OR GB HB I1 I2 I3 = 40
up to 20,000 sq.ft. = 1.0 20,001  100,000 sq.ft. = 1.5 100,001  200,000 sq.ft. = 2.0 200,000+ sq.ft. = 3.0
up to 30 = 1.0 31 --44mph = 1.5 45 --55mph = 2.5
Round the product of all factors up to the next whole number.
FOOTNOTES TO 4-8-7-b: (Amend 20) 1 This is the legal speed limit along the full length of an integrated center's street frontage. Where a sign-lot fronts on a public or private frontage road, the speed limit of the thoroughfare pertains, not that of the frontage road. Where an integrated center has no actual street frontage, this is the legal speed limit of the adjoining road from which that center derives vehicular access, at that access point. In an HB zone, where an integrated center is located within 400? of a primary arterial, fronts on and derives its only access from a local road which in turn derives its access from a primary arterial, then the speed limit of the primary arterial --where the local road intersects -pertains. Where the legal speed limit changes along the length of an integrated center's street frontage (or between access points for integrated centers having no street frontage), road speed limit is the greater of the speed limits along the length of the frontage (or at the number of access points if there is no frontage). Frontage along I-65 is not counted in this calculation. If the legal speed limit is increased after signage has been installed, maximum sign area may be increased accordingly. If the speed limit is decreased, no decrease in signage is required.

4-8-7 SIGNAGE FOR INTEGRATED CENTERS (contd.):
(c)
The name of the integrated center shall comprise at least 25% of the total sign area of the integrated center sign; (Amend 67)
(d)
In the GB and HB zones, up to of 25% of the total sign area of an integrated center sign may be changeable copy. The message portion of the changeable copy sign is limited to on-site tenant advertising only and is subject to the definition of changeable copy signs. (Amend 67)
4-8-8 PERMITTED SIGN CHARACTERISTICS BY ZONE: Authorization to use animation, changeable copy, and various forms of illumination on signs permitted in 4-8-4 through 4-8-7 above is based on the following table. Except for externally illuminated gateway signs at residential developments, which may be illuminated at all times, signs shall only be animated and/or illuminated during hours when the primary use of the sign-lot is open to the public. Changeable copy signs as part of an integrated center sign that utilize LED and/or digital technology to display a message must be turned off from the hours of 11
p.m. until 6 a.m., regardless of whether a business in the integrated center is open to the public. (Amend 67)

4-8-9 EVENT ORIENTED SIGNS: (Amend 8) These are freestanding signs, intended to commemorate a special event or sporting event, or to notify potential customers of a new business or sale. They are meant to be decorative and festive. Because they are not permanent in nature, but rather augment permanent signage on a sign-lot, they are subject only to the requirements of 4-8-4 above, and not 4-8-5 through 4-8-8. Thus they do not count against a sign-lots permitted maximum sign area.
(a)
Event oriented signs shall be permitted only on the premises where the special event is happening.
(b)
These signs, where allowed in 4-8-4 above, shall not be placed on a premises in a commercial, industrial or rural zone, nor at an institutional use (SIC 801-972) in a residential zone, for more than 21 days within a 90 day period (Amend 5), no more than 4 times per year. (Amend 20)
(c)
These signs, where allowed in 4-8-4 above, shall not be placed on a premises, other than an institutional use in a residential zone, for more than 3 days within a 90 day period, no more than 4 times per year. (Amnd 20)
(d)
These signs, where allowed in 4-8-4 above, shall not be located either within the right-of-way of any public street, or in the vision triangle formed by the intersection of streets, alleys or driveways.
(e)
Event oriented signs consist of the following:
(1)
portable signs;
(2)
beacons;
(3)
pennants;
(4)
strings of lights not permanently mounted to a rigid background;
(5)
inflatable signs and tethered or portable balloons; and
(6) banners (Amend 5, 18).
(f)
Event oriented signs shall incorporate no lights or arrows resembling traffic control signs or signals that confuse or interfere with the safe flow of traffic.
4-8-10 OUTDOOR ADVERTISING SIGNS: Outdoor advertising signs, often called billboards, are permitted in GB, I1, I2 and I3 zones (TIPPECANOE COUNTY, LAFAYETTE, BATTLE GROUND, CLARKS HILL, DAYTON) and I2 and I3 zones (WEST LAFAYETTE), as per 4-84 above. (Amend 4) They are not subject to the requirements of 4-8-5 through 4-88.
However, they are subject to the following regulations:
(a)
Outdoor advertising signs shall be no larger than 300 sq.ft. per advertising face.
(b)
No outdoor advertising sign shall be erected less than 300? from a residential use, or a residential zone, whichever is closer. (Amend 2)
(c)
Outdoor advertising signs shall consist only of single structures, having either 1 advertising face, or 2 back-to-back advertising faces. There shall be no double-decked (stacked) or side-by-side outdoor advertising signs.
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 189
(d)
Outdoor advertising signs shall be erected no closer than 25? from the edge of any street?s right-of-way, measured to the leading edge of the sign. They shall have a maximum height of 25?. However, for each foot of setback beyond 25?, sign height may be increased an additional foot, up to but no higher than 50?. Should an outdoor advertising sign adjoin 2 or more rights-of-way, the shortest of the multiple setbacks shall
determine the billboard?s maximum height (Amend 13).
(e)
Outdoor advertising signs shall maintain a minimum clearance of 10? above the ground immediately beneath the sign.
(f)
Outdoor advertising signs shall not be placed closer than 1000? from each other. This distance is to be measured radially. (Amend 20)
(g)
However, if an intersection is already occupied by an outdoor advertising sign, a single billboard may be erected on the other (intersecting) street no closer than 600? from the center of the intersection, providing that it is oriented perpendicularly to the other (intersecting) street.
(h)
Regarding animation, an outdoor advertising sign may change its message or lighting no more than once per minute.
(i)
The sign area for an outdoor advertising sign with more than one face is computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. Where one outdoor advertising sign with two equally-sized sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, and where such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not farther apart than half the length of the sign, the sign area is computed by the measurement of one of the faces. (Amend 20)
4-8-11 SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT SIGNS: (Amend 14)
(a)
Freestanding signage shall be permitted for each subdivision granted secondary approval by APC and recorded under the Unified Subdivision Ordinance of Tippecanoe County. Such signage is not subject to the requirements of 4-8-4 through 4-8-8. However it is subject to the following:

A subdivision development sign that is located outside that subdivision?s platted area, advertising that subdivision, shall be considered an outdoor advertising sign, subject to all requirements of 4-8-10 above.
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 190
(2)
A subdivision development sign shall only be permitted at a subdivision entrance to an existing perimeter public road. Each qualifying subdivision entrance shall only be permitted one sign. Each such sign shall consist only of a single structure, and may have either 1 or 2 advertising faces, neither of which shall exceed 100 sq.ft. Sign faces separated by not more than a 30° angle will be considered one sign.
(3)
The subdivision development sign shall not be located within any utility easement, nor within any right-of-way.
(4)
Such sign shall neither be an animated sign, nor a changeable copy sign.

Where a proposed use abuts an unimproved property and a bufferyard is required because of a zoning boundary, the property owner of the proposed use need not provide more than half the bufferyard width and standard plant units required in 4-9-3 above.
(b)
Where a proposed use abuts an improved property and a bufferyard is required because of a zoning boundary, the property owner of the proposed use must provide all additional land and plant material needed to complete the full bufferyard required in 4-9-3 above: Where the abutting use was developed with half a required bufferyard, the property owner of the proposed use must provide the remaining half. Where the abutting use was developed with no bufferyard, the property owner of the proposed use is responsible for installing the entire bufferyard. However, existing plant material and/or land located on the improved property which meets the requirements of this section may be counted by the Administrative Officer as contributing to the total bufferyard that needs to be installed by the property owner of the proposed use.
Chapter 4 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 197
(c)
The property owner of a proposed use required to provide a bufferyard may be exempted from providing all or a portion of the required bufferyard by recording a written agreement, approved by the Administrative Officer, that the adjacent property owner(s) will provide the remaining required portion.
(d)
The property owner will decide the exact placement of required plants.
(e)
In the event of subdivision, the subdivider shall install the required bufferyard as part of required public improvements.
(f)
The owner and/or possessor of a required bufferyard shall maintain it in accordance with the approved site plan or subdivision Construction Plans. Failure to do so is a violation of this ordinance as per 6-3-1-d below.
4-9-6 BUFFERYARD USE:
(a)
A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation, pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails, or storm water management, provided that:
(1)
no plant material is eliminated;
(2)
the total width of the bufferyard is maintained; and
(3)
all other regulations of this ordinance, and any ordinance of the appropriate drainage authority, are met.
(b)
However, in no event shall accessory use swimming pools and their associated decking, tennis courts, or other such uses be permitted in a bufferyard.
4-9-7 BUFFERING FOR CERTAIN OPEN USES:

the nonconforming use is not abandoned for more than 1 year, except when government action impedes access to the premises. If a nonconforming use has been abandoned for more than 1 year, any subsequent use of that land shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance.
(d)
When a nonconforming use is damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of that use, the nonconforming use shall no longer be permitted. (Amend 61)
(1) When a nonconforming use in the FP zone is substantially damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the market value of that use, the substantially damaged nonconforming use shall no longer be permitted in the FP zone. (Amend 56 and 61)
(e)
A nonconforming use changed to a conforming use, shall never be changed back to a nonconforming use.
(f)
A nonconforming use may be replaced by another nonconforming use if the property owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrative Officer that the impact on surrounding uses of the replacement will be less than that of its predecessor. The Administrative Officer shall measure impact in terms of traffic generation, hours of operation, noise production and outdoor lighting.
5-1-3 NONCONFORMING MOBILE HOMES: Mobile homes are designed to be movable rather than fixed structures. Because of that distinction, when a mobile home is a nonconforming use, the requirements of this section apply, rather than those of 5-1-2 above
(a)
A nonconforming mobile home is one which is not permitted in 3-2 above to be located in the zone in which it is in fact located, and which otherwise lawfully existed at the time the applicable portion of 3-2 became effective.
(b)
An otherwise lawful mobile home made a nonconforming mobile home by this ordinance or an amendment to it, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, if:
(1) the land area of the use and/or the dimensions of the mobile home are not increased beyond what they were at the time this ordinance or its amendment became effective;
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 211
(2)
it is not moved to any portion of its lot other than that which it occupied at the time this ordinance or its amendment became effective;
(3)
no additional structure serving the nonconforming mobile home is erected;
(4)
the nonconforming mobile home is not abandoned for more than 1 year, except when government action impedes access to the premises. If a nonconforming mobile home has been abandoned for more than 1 year, any subsequent use of that land shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance. Termination of electrical service for more than 1 year shall be construed as evidence of intent to abandon.
(c) When a nonconforming mobile home is damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of that mobile home, the nonconforming mobile home shall no longer be permitted. (Amend 61)
(1) When a nonconforming mobile home in the FP zone is substantially damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the market value of that mobile home, the substantially damaged nonconforming mobile home use shall no longer be permitted in the FP zone. (Amend 56
and 61)
(d)
A nonconforming mobile home changed to a conforming use, shall never be changed back to a nonconforming mobile home.
(e)
A nonconforming mobile home that has been abandoned, shall never be reoccupied, returned to its location or replaced by another nonconforming mobile home. However, in an FP zone, a nonconforming mobile home that has been abandoned, shall never be reoccupied, returned to its location or replaced by another nonconforming mobile home, regardless of time frame.
(f)
A nonconforming mobile home shall not be replaced by any other kind of nonconforming use.
5-1-4 NONCONFORMING MOBILE HOME PARKS/MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES:
(a) An otherwise lawful mobile home park / manufactured home community made a nonconforming use by this ordinance or an amendment to it, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. The nonconforming mobile home park / manufactured home community may be reconfigured, as long as the number of lots is not increased. Other changes may be made as well, such as adding paved streets, and upgrading other on-site structures and facilities. However:
(1) the land area of the nonconforming mobile home park manufactured home community shall not increase beyond what it was at the time this ordinance or its amendment became
212 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
effective, without submission of a new mobile home park / manufactured home community plan as per 5-4 below, for the additional land area.
(2)
no additional or larger signs are erected which are intended to be seen from off the premises, unless such signs remain within the parameters of 4-8-4 through 4-8-8 above; and
(3)
the nonconforming mobile home park / manufactured home community is not abandoned for more than 1 year, except when government action impedes access to the premises. If a nonconforming use has been abandoned for more than 1 year, any subsequent use of that land shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance.
(b)
When a nonconforming mobile home park / manufactured home community is damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of that use, the nonconforming use shall no longer be permitted. Repairs to any individual mobile home / manufactured home located within a mobile home park / manufactured home community and owned by a person or entity other than the person or entity owning and/or operating the nonconforming mobile home park / manufactured home community shall not be considered in calculating the replacement costs of the nonconforming mobile home park / manufactured home community. (Amend 52 and 61)
(c)
A nonconforming use changed to a conforming use, shall never be changed back to a nonconforming use.
(d)
A nonconforming use may be replaced by another nonconforming use if the property owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrative Officer that the impact on surrounding uses of the replacement will be less than that of its predecessor. The Administrative Officer shall measure impact in terms of traffic generation, hours of operation, noise production and outdoor lighting.
5-1-5 NONCONFORMING LOTS:
(a)
A nonconforming lot is a lot which does not meet the minimum requirements in 4-2 above for lot area or 4-3 above for lot width, and which otherwise lawfully existed at the time those minimum requirements became effective (Amend 18).
(b)
A single-family dwelling and its customary accessory buildings may always be erected on a nonconforming lot in any zone in which single-family dwellings are permitted, if:
(1)
the legally created lot was either recorded in separate ownership or included in a recorded subdivision on or before January 2, 1998, the effective date of this ordinance (Amend 18); and
(2)
the dwelling and its accessory buildings otherwise meet all other requirements of this ordinance.
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 213
(c)
A nonconforming lot changed to a conforming lot shall never be changed back to a nonconforming lot.
(d)
No conforming or nonconforming lot may be made nonconforming or more nonconforming by use of Exemption E in the definition of subdivision in 1-10-2 above.
5-1-6 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
(a)
A nonconforming structure is a structure (including a building) which entirely or in part does not meet the minimum requirements in 4-2, 4-4 and 4-5 above for front, rear or side setbacks, lot coverage or maximum permitted building height, and which otherwise lawfully existed at the time those requirements became effective. However, any conforming structure made a nonconforming structure by a government taking or by grant of right-of-way, shall be considered conforming within the context of this ordinance (Amend 7).
(b)
A nonconforming structure occupied by a nonconforming use shall not be moved on its lot or altered, except in a way that decreases the structure's nonconformity. Altered shall not be construed to mean enlarged.
(c)
A nonconforming structure occupied by a permitted use may be moved on its lot, altered or enlarged in any way, provided the alteration or enlargement either meets all requirements of this ordinance, or decreases the structure's nonconformity.
(d)
When a nonconforming structure is damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of that structure, it shall only be reconstructed in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance. If it had been occupied by a nonconforming use, that use will no longer be permitted. (Amend 61)
(1) When a nonconforming structure in the FP zone is substantially damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the market value of that structure, the substantially damaged nonconforming structure shall no longer be permitted in the FP zone. (Amend 56 and 61)
(e)
A nonconforming structure changed to a conforming structure shall never be changed back to a nonconforming structure.
5-1-7 NONCONFORMING SIGNAGE:
(a)
Nonconforming signage is a sign or a package of signs on a sign-lot that does not meet the requirements of 4-8-4 through 4-8-8 above, and which was otherwise lawfully installed on a given site at the time the applicable portions of 4-8-4 through 4-8-8 became effective.
(b)
Otherwise lawful signage made nonconforming by this ordinance or an amendment to it, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, if:
214 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
(1)
the signage's area is not increased beyond what it was at the time this ordinance or its amendment became effective;
(2)
the signage is moved neither in whole nor in part to any portion of its sign-lot other than that which it occupied at the time this ordinance or its amendment became effective, or to a location that lessens the nonconformity (Amend 15); and
(3)
the primary use of its sign-lot is not abandoned for more than 1 year, except when government action impedes access to the premises. If the primary use has been abandoned for more than 1 year, any subsequent signage on that sign-lot shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance.
(c)
When nonconforming signage is damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of that signage, the nonconforming signage will no longer be permitted. (Amend 61)
(1) When nonconforming signage in the FP zone is substantially damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the market value of that signage, the substantially damaged nonconforming signage shall no longer be permitted in the FP zone. (Amend 56 and 61)
(d)
If the distance from the edge of the right-of-way of on-premise nonconforming signage is further reduced by government acquisition of additional right-of-way, then it shall be moved to a distance from the new right-of-way line no less than the distance from the previous right-of-way line. If the distance from the edge of the right-of-way of conforming on-premise signage is reduced by government acquisition of additional right-of-way, it remains conforming.
(e)
Nonconforming signage changed to conforming signage, shall never be changed back to nonconforming signage.
(f)
Signage that failed to comply with the requirements of the previous regulations in effect at the time this ordinance or its amendment became effective, and which fails to comply with the requirements of 4-8-4 through 4-8-8 above, is neither nonconforming nor lawful signage.
5-1-8 NONCOMPLYING USES:
(a)
A noncomplying use is a primary use of a structure (including a building) or lot which fails to meet one or more of the requirements of 4-2 and 4-6 through 4-11 above regarding minimum vegetative cover, parking and loading, entrances, signs, buffering, industrial or miscellaneous restrictions, and which otherwise lawfully existed at the time those requirements became effective.
(b)
A noncomplying use which is also a nonconforming use shall not be moved on its lot, altered or enlarged, except in a way that
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 215
decreases the use's noncompliance, or in a way that prepares it for a permitted use.
(c)
A noncomplying use which is a permitted primary use may be altered or enlarged in any way, provided the alteration or enlargement meets all requirements of this ordinance.
(d)
When a noncomplying use is damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of that use, it shall only be reconstructed in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. If it was also a nonconforming use, that use will no longer be permitted. (Amend 61)
(1) When a noncomplying use in the FP zone is substantially damaged by any means to the extent that the repair cost exceeds 50% of the market value of that use, the substantially damaged noncomplying use shall no longer be permitted in the FP zone. (Amend 56 and 61)
(e)
A noncomplying use changed to a complying use shall never be changed back to a noncomplying use.
5-1-9 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:
(a)
Discretionary repair and maintenance may be done on any nonconforming use or nonconforming structure, only if:
(1)
the work consists of ordinary repairs, or of repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing;
(2)
the total cost of such discretionary repair and maintenance does not exceed 30% of the replacement cost of that use or structure in any 3-year period (Amend 7 and 61), or
(i) For properties in the FP zone, the total cost of such discretionary repair and maintenance shall not exceed 10% of the market value of that use, structure or mobile home in the FP zone in any 1-year period and cumulatively along with documented damage totals from previous events shall not equal or exceed 50% of the market value of that use, structure or mobile home over the life of the use, structure or mobile home in the FP zone; (Amend 56 and 61) and
(3)
the land area of the use and/or the cubic content of its structure are not increased beyond what they were at the time this ordinance or its amendment became effective.
(b)
Structural alterations shall not be made except as required by law.
5-1-10 WORK IN PROGRESS: No change shall be required in plans, construction or designated use of any structure or development if:
(a) an improvement location permit was lawfully obtained before the effective date of that ordinance or amendment; or
216 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
(b) construction plans were approved under the Unified Subdivision Ordinance of Tippecanoe County before the effective date of that ordinance or amendment; and
the building or development is completed before expiration of its improvement location permit as per 6-2-4-a below.

(e)
Discrepancies between Map and Actual Ground Elevations:
1) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped FP zone, the FIRM, and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided in the Flood Insurance Study shall govern.
2) If the elevation of the site in question is below the regulatory flood elevation, that site shall be included in the FP zone and regulated accordingly.
3) If the natural grade elevation of the site in question is above the regulatory flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the FP zone and the regulations of this section shall not apply.
(f) Administration:
1) Designation of Administrator: The APC Executive Director shall administer and implement the provisions of this section and is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.
2) Permit Procedures: Application for a Floodplain Development Permit shall be made to the Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 217
to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed residences and other structures, earthen fill, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically the following information is required:
(A)
Application stage:
(i)
A description of the proposed development;
(ii)
Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately locate property and structures in relation to existing roads and watercourses;
(iii) A legal description of the property;
(iv)
A site plan showing the location of all existing and proposed development and all existing and proposed land grades;

(B)
Construction stage: Upon placement of the lowest floor, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 elevation of the lowest floor elevation as built, and an elevation certificate. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification and the elevation certificate shall be at the permit holders risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted. The permit holder shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to proceed. The failure to submit such certification and the elevation certificate or the failure to make all corrections required by the Floodplain Administrator shall be cause for the issuance of a stop work order.
3) Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator: The Floodplain Administrator and/or designated staff is hereby authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this section. The Floodplain Administrator and/or designated staff are further authorized to render interpretations of this ordinance, which are consistent with its spirit and purpose.
218 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5

(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)
(F)
(G)
(H)
(I)
(J)
Review all Floodplain Development Permits to assure that the requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied. With the Administrative Officer, inspect and inventory damaged structures in FP zones and complete determinations with respect to substantially damaged structures. Ensure that all necessary construction authorizations have been granted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and maintain a record of such authorizations. Ensure that all necessary federal and state permits have been received prior to issuance of the Floodplain Development Permit, and maintain a record of all such authorizations. Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request Floodplain Development Permit documents, damaged structure inventories, substantial damage determinations, regulatory flood data, SFHA maps, Letters of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letters of Map Revision (LOMR), copies of DNR permits and flood plain analysis and regulatory assessments (letters of recommendation), federal permit documents, and asbuilt elevation data for all residences elevated pursuant to this section. Utilize all Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) or Physical Map Revisions (PMR) issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA maps of the community. Verify the actual lowest floor elevation (including basement) of all elevated residences. Review certified plans and specifications for compliance. Stop Work Orders:
(i)
Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator, work on any building, structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions of this section shall immediately cease.
(ii)
Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed.
Revocation of Permits
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 219
(i)
The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a Floodplain Development Permit, issued by the Floodplain Administrator under the provisions of the ordinance, in cases where there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to any material fact in the application or plans on which the Floodplain Development Permit was based.
(ii)
The Floodplain Administrator may revoke a Floodplain Development Permit upon determination by the Floodplain Administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the Floodplain Development Permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this ordinance.
(g) Elevation of Existing Residences
1) Elevation Standards: Until July 1, 2013, in all FP zones any existing residence (excluding mobile homes) that has been substantially damaged or suffered repetitive loss may be elevated such that the lowest floor elevation is at or above the flood protection grade. A registered professional engineer or architect registered in the State of Indiana shall certify that the elevation of the residence has been designed so that the means of elevation of the residence are capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood and meet all of the criteria required by this section. In addition, the certification shall also certify that all attendant utility facilities below the flood protection grade are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood and meet all of the criteria required by this section. The elevation and utility protection designs shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in this section. Should solid perimeter walls be used to elevate a residence, such enclosed area shall be designed to preclude living space, and the design shall meet the following minimum criteria:
(A)
provide for a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area;
(B)
provide that all openings shall be located entirely below the flood protection grade;
(C)
provide that the bottom of all openings shall be either:
220 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
(i)
no more than one foot above the exterior grade immediately beneath each opening, or
(ii)
no more than one foot above foundations interior grade in structures where the interior grade is higher than the exterior grade;
(D)
provide that openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that such coverings or devices permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;
(E)
provide that the interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms;
(F)
provide that the interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an elevation at or higher than the exterior grade; and
(G)
provide that an adequate drainage system must be installed to remove floodwaters from the interior area within a reasonable period of time after a flood event.
2) Additional Standards: All designs must also include the following additional minimum criteria:
(A)
The means of elevation shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the residence;
(B)
The means of elevation shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage below the flood protection grade;
(C)
The means of elevation shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
(D)
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, utility meters, and other service facilities shall be located at or above the flood protection grade or designed so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components below the flood protection grade. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities may be located below the flood protection grade;
(E)
Replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(F)
Replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; and
(G)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 221
(H) Where the lowest floor elevation is 6 or more feet above the highest adjacent grade, a deed restriction irrevocable by the owner and enforceable by the APC prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor elevation to a use contrary to the originally approved design shall be recorded as a condition of issuance of the final certificate of compliance.
3) Additional Standards for Identified Regulatory Floodways: Areas designated as regulatory floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and have erosion potential. If the site is in an identified regulatory floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a regulatory floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1, a permit for construction in a regulatory floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local improvement location permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the regulatory floodway. This includes land preparation activities, such as filling, grading, clearing, paving, etc., undertaken before the actual start of construction of any structure.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the regulatory floodway. Once a permit for construction in a regulatory floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue a Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in this section have otherwise been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a regulatory floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot.
4) Additional Standards for Identified Floodway Fringe: If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue a Floodplain
222 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
Development Permit provided all provisions contained in this section have been met and further provided that the lowest floor elevation of the elevated residence shall be at or above the flood protection grade.
5) Additional Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas Without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or Floodway or Floodway Fringe:
(A) Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile: If the site is in an identified special flood hazard area where the limits of the floodway and the floodway fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the regulatory flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this section have been met.
(B) Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile: If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and the floodway fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the flood plain and regulatory flood elevation for the site.
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 223
Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue a Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in this section have been met.
(C) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will
not
increase flood
damages
or
potential
flood
damages.
6) Additional
Standards
for
Flood
Prone
Areas:
All
development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet general standards as required by this section.
5-2 SUBDIVISIONS, PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDOMINIUMS
5-2-1 SUBDIVISIONS:
(a)
The subdivision of land in accord with the requirements of the adopted Unified Subdivision Ordinance is permitted in these zones: R1, R1A, R1B, R1U, R1Z, R2, R2U, R3, R3U, R3W, R4W, NB, NBU, OR, MR, MRU, GB, HB, CB, CBW, I1, I2, I3, A, AA, AW, FP and RE (Amend 27 and 69). The intended primary use of each proposed lot within a proposed subdivision determines the specific zone or zones appropriate to the land to be subdivided, as per 3-2 above.
(b)
However, the following kinds of subdivisions are only permitted in R1, R1A, R1B, R1U, R1Z, R2, R2U, R3, R3U, R3W, and R4W zones:
(1)
major subdivisions intended entirely for residential use, and
(2)
any portions of major subdivisions intended for residential use;
(3)
other subdivisions intended entirely for residential use granted preliminary plat approval by the APC after May 1, 1975, and
(4)
any portions of other subdivisions intended for residential use granted preliminary plat approval by the APC after May 1, 1975.
(c)
The only kind of subdivision permitted in an RE zone, is a rural estate subdivision, formulated and approved within the requirements of the adopted Unified Subdivision Ordinance (Amend 27).
5-2-2 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS:
Planned developments are permitted only in these zones: PDRS, PDNR, PDMX, and PDCC, as per 2-26 above. PD zoning may be used to foster innovative and diverse design in land development that is still consistent with both the adopted Comprehensive Plan and the intent of the Unified Zoning Ordinance. As such, the requirements of Chapters 2 and 4 above do not apply to planned developments. All restrictions and regulations for a specific planned development are negotiated between the APC, the petitioner and participating checkpoint agencies, and thus are contained
224 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
within the approved and recorded plan itself, having been arrived at prior to rezoning.
5-2-3 CONDOMINIUMS: Condominiums, as defined and regulated in I.C. 32-1-6 (the Horizontal Property Law), are considered for zoning purposes to be planned developments, and thus are permitted only in these zones: PDRS, PDNR, PDMX, and PDCC, as per 2-27 above. The PDCC zone shall be used in cases where the only change proposed for a development constructed no less than 3 years prior, is conversion to condominium ownership.
5-3 AIR SPACE CONTROL
5-3-1 INTENT: The maximum height of buildings, structures, and plant growth is regulated by this section --under the authority conferred in Chapter 283 of the 1955 Acts of the General Assembly of Indiana, as amended --in order to prevent the construction of obstructions to air navigation in the vicinity of any public-use airport. This protects the lives and property of persons living in that vicinity, and of those in aircraft which are approaching, taking off from, or circling that airport, promoting public health, safety and general welfare.
5-3-2 AIRPORT DISTRICTS:
(a)
Airport districts, which are overlay zones, consist of 2 parts, an airport approach area and an airport circling area.
(b)
Airport districts and their 2 parts are shown on an airport district map for each public-use airport in the county. These maps are part of this section of this ordinance.
5-3-3 AIRPORT DISTRICT REGULATIONS: The regulations in 5-3-4 and 5-3-5 below apply to all land within an airport district, and are in addition to all other zoning regulations applicable to that land. In case of conflict, the more restrictive regulations control.
5-3-4 HEIGHT:
(a) Except as in 5-3-4-b below, within the airport circling area or the airport approach area of an airport district, no part of any new building, structure or plant growth shall be constructed, located or grown, and no part of any existing building, structure or plant growth shall be reconstructed, relocated, or enlarged, so that it projects above either the airport approach surfaces, the airport primary surfaces, the airport transitional surfaces, the airport horizontal surface, or the airport conical surface, whichever is most restrictive.

However, projections may extend to a maximum height of 50' above the established airport elevation, except within the airport approach and airport transitional surfaces.
(c)
The maximum permitted height above ground level for any building, structure, or plant growth is computed as follows:
(1)
Determine the elevation of the site in question in feet above mean sea level;
(2)
Compute the difference between the site elevation and the established airport elevation (as shown on the airport district map);
(3)
If the site elevation is higher than the established airport elevation, subtract the difference from the elevation of the airport referenced surfaces directly above that site; if lower, add the difference to the elevation of the airport referenced surfaces for that site. The result is the maximum permissible height. (Amend 45)
(4)
Proof of conformance lies with the property owner; any assistance by the Administrative Officer in finding applicable elevations is construed to be of assistance only. In cases of any doubt the Administrative Officer shall require an affidavit signed by a Registered Land Surveyor or Registered Civil Engineer, certifying that the height of the structures and plant growth conforms to this section.
5-3-5 USE RESTRICTIONS: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use shall be made of land or water within any airport district established by 5-3-2 above in such a manner as to either:
(a)
create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft;
(b)
make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others;
(c)
result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport;
(d)
impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;
(e)
create bird strike hazards;
(f)
or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
5-4 MOBILE HOME PARKS / MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARKS AND CAMPGROUNDS
5-4-1 INTENT:
This section details the process by which mobile home parks / manufactured home communities (MHP/MHC) and recreational
226 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
vehicle parks and campgrounds (SIC 7033) are approved, and covers regulations that are applied to them. MHP/MHCs are residential facilities; recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds (RVP/Cs) provide en route accommodations or serve as a destination site for people occupying recreational vehicles (RVs) and/or tents. MHP/MHCs and RVP/Cs involve the creation of individual use sites (called mobile home park / manufactured home community lots and campsites respectively), and internal circulation patterns, much like subdivisions and some kinds of planned developments. What distinguishes them is that no mobile home park / manufactured home community lots are created that need to be platted. To ensure adequate design and circulation, and to ensure that state mandated health-related standards are met, plans detailing the proposed MHP/MHC or RVP/C shall be submitted for approval by the APC at a public hearing before work can begin.
5-4-2 MHP/MHC AND RVP/C APPROVAL PROCESS:
(a)
Before improvement location permits can be sought (other than one that would permit filling in the flood plain for an area to be included in the MHP/MHC or RVP/C),or any on-site work can begin, plans for a new MHP/MHC or RVP/C, or an expansion of an existing MHP/MHC or RVP/C, shall be approved by the APC in a public hearing at its regular meeting. All such new plans and expansions are subject to the public notice and filing requirements of 5-4-3 and 5-4-4 below. Any change to a site plan approved under this ordinance, the elements of which are listed in 5-4-5-c below, shall also be approved by the APC in a public hearing at its regular meeting. However, this does not apply to a reconfiguration of the same number of lots, or the paving of previously unpaved internal streets, nor upgrading other on-site structures and facilities. But, a change to an internal street name does require approval of the APC Executive Director, the US Post Office, and the 911 Emergency Response System.
(b)
The filing deadline for a complete application for MHP/MHC or RVP/C plan approval is 30 calendar days prior to the date of the regular meeting at which the petitioner intends to have the request heard. The requirements for a complete application are listed in 5-4-4 below.
(c)
Notice of this public hearing shall appear in 2 local newspapers of general circulation at least 10 days before the hearing. Also, one or more signs notifying the public need to be posted on the affected property at least 10 days before the hearing. Details of public hearing notification appear below in 5-4-3.
(d)
At the hearing, the APC may either approve, conditionally approve or deny the MHP/MHC or RVP/C plans presented by the petitioner. If
Chapter 5 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 227
the petitioner or the petitioner's representative is not present at the hearing, the APC shall dismiss the request.
(e) MHP/MHC-lots may be vacated using the means described in Indiana Code 36-7-3 or its successors, which describes the process for vacating lots in a subdivision.
5-4-3 PUBLIC NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:
(a)
A petitioner shall file 2 "Notices of Public Hearing on Mobile Home Park / Manufactured Home Community and Recreational Vehicle Park" and 2 "Notices of Public Hearing Release Forms" as part of a complete application for MHP/MHC or RVP/C plan approval. The Release Forms authorize APC staff to give the Notices of Public Hearing to 2 local newspapers of general circulation for publication at least 10 days before the date of the public hearing. Publication is at the petitioner's expense. Each newspaper will then bill the petitioner. Upon payment of the bills, the petitioner will receive each newspaper's Proof of Publication. The petitioner shall present both Proofs to the APC prior to the public hearing, or the request for plan approval cannot be heard.
(b)
At least 10 days before the date of the public hearing, the petitioner shall post one or more signs on (or in some cases near) the property for which MHP/MHC or RVP/C approval is being sought, advising the public of the impending hearing. These signs shall be purchased at the APC's offices. APC staff will determine the number and location of signs to be posted. On the day of the public hearing, the petitioner shall execute a "Sign Posting Affidavit" attesting that the required signage has been in place for at least the previous 10 days. The petitioner shall present the notarized affidavit to the APC prior to the public hearing, or the request for plan approval cannot be heard.
(c)
At least 10 days before the date of the public hearing, the petitioner shall send a "Notice to Interested Parties" to the owners of all property located adjacent to, and directly across the street, alley, or railroad right-of-way from the property for which MHP/MHC or RVP/C plan approval is being sought.

5-4-8 MHP/MHC RESTRICTION: The owner, occupant or lessor of a mobile home in a mobile home park/manufactured home community, shall not build any permanent additions that attach to that mobile home that would add to the living space within.
5-5 HOME OCCUPATIONS AND RURAL HOME OCCUPATIONS
5-5-1 INTENT:
(a)
This section authorizes as home occupations and rural home occupations all uses that conform to its standards. In general, a home or rural home occupation is an accessory use located and conducted in such a way that neighbors, under normal circumstances, would be unaware of its existence except for a sign as permitted in 4-8 above. To establish whether a proposed accessory use qualifies as a home or rural home occupation, standards have been set to ensure compatibility with permitted uses, to maintain neighborhood character (whether urban or rural, residential or agricultural), and to clearly indicate a status that is secondary or incidental to an existing and occupied dwelling unit.
(b)
Because compatibility with permitted uses and neighborhood character vary considerably with location and zoning, this section distinguishes between what may be suited to all living environments and what may be uniquely suited to agricultural settings. Thus home occupations conforming to the requirements of 5-5-2 through 5-5-4 below, are permitted in any non-rural zone which authorizes the dwelling unit to which the home occupation is accessory, in A, AA and AW zones on lots up to 2 acres in area, and on all residential lots in RE zones; rural home occupations conforming to the requirements of 5-5-5 through 5-5-7 below, are permitted as an accessory use on rural-zoned lots, other than those zoned RE, larger than 2 acres in area (Amend 27).
5-5-2 HOME OCCUPATION USE REQUIREMENTS: In addition to all other requirements applicable in the zone in which located, all home occupations are subject to the following:
(a)
No alteration shall be made to the exterior of the primary use building or to the lot which changes the residential character of that building or lot.
(b)
The operator of a home occupation shall be a resident of the dwelling unit and no employees are allowed who are not residents of that dwelling unit.
(c)
A home occupation shall not involve construction features or the use of any electrical or mechanical equipment or combustible materials any of which would change the fire separation requirements of the primary use building.
234 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 5
(d)
There can be no activity or storage of any kind related to the home occupation outside the primary use building.
(e)
A home occupation shall provide an additional off-street parking area adequate to accommodate needs created by the home occupation. This area shall contain at least 1 parking space, which shall be in addition to the parking spaces required for the dwelling unit. This parking space shall be provided on the same lot as the home occupation, and may be located in the front setback (but not in the right-of-way).
(f)
A home occupation shall not create noise, dust, vibration, smell, smoke, glare, electrical interference, fire or chemical hazard, traffic hazard, or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater or more frequent extent than would be expected from a normally occupied dwelling unit in that zone that has no home occupation.
(g)
Except for articles grown or crafted on the premises, no stock in trade shall be displayed, stored, or sold. A home occupation is neither a retail nor wholesale establishment.
5-5-3 PERMITTED HOME OCCUPATIONS:

To be eligible for a grant of special exception under this section, a petitioner shall first receive a determination from the Administrative Officer that a special exception is required for the intended use, or for the expansion, extension, or enlargement of a use under 6-4-4-h below. The Administrative Officer shall file a determination report (in a form prescribed by the ABZA) with the APC. The APC shall decide if the grant of special exception would have a substantial, adverse effect on the purposes served by this ordinance in furtherance of the Comprehensive Plan. The APC shall report its decision to the ABZA within 30 days of its receipt of the application, so that the ABZA can act on it.
(c)
The ABZA may grant a special exception for a use in a zone if, after a hearing under 6-4-3-d above, it makes findings of facts in writing, that:
(1)
3-2 above authorizes a special exception for that use in that zone; and
(2)
the requirements and development standards for the requested use as prescribed by this ordinance will be met; and
Chapter 6 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 253
(3)
granting the special exception will not subvert the general purposes served by this ordinance; and
(4)
will not materially and permanently injure other property or uses in the same zone and vicinity because of traffic generation, placement of outdoor lighting, noise production or hours of operation,
(d)
The ABZA may impose reasonable conditions on its approval as it deems necessary to find that 6-4-4-c-2 above will be served.
(e)
The ABZA may permit or require the property owner and/or the petitioner to make a written commitment concerning the use or development of the property as specified under I.C. 36-7-4-921
(Amend 15).
(f)
If the ABZA grants the special exception, it will direct the petitioner to apply for an improvement location permit under 6-2 above. If that application complies with this ordinance and all other applicable codes and ordinances, the Administrative Officer shall issue the improvement location permit for the use authorized by the special exception.
(g)
A grant of special exception is unnecessary for a use authorized by 3-2 above if that use existed on the effective date of this ordinance or pertinent amendments to it. However, this subsection does not authorize the expansion of such a use if it involves the enlargement of a building, structure, or land area.
(h)
A use authorized by special exception shall not be expanded, extended, enlarged, or moved unless reauthorized by the ABZA under the procedures established in this ordinance for granting a special exception. However, additional buildings and phases shall be permitted without reauthorization, if they were indicated on the original site plan, and the use itself is established within 1 year of ABZAs grant of special exception (Amend 15).
(i)
A special exception granted for a specific use under 6-4-4-c or authorized by 6-4-4-g ceases to be authorized and is void:
(1)
if that use (for any use other than a wind farm) is not established within 1 year of the date the special exception was granted; or
(2)
if that use is a wind farm and is not established within 18 months of the date the special exception was granted;
(Amend 73) or
(3)
if that use is discontinued at that site for a 1-year period during which time it is not succeeded by the same use specifically authorized as a special exception; or
(4)
if the use in SIC Group 10-14 is not established within 1 year of the date at which excavation is expected to have begun, as established by ABZA for the mining operation.
(j) A special exception may be terminated by the ABZA if it finds a failure to comply with the terms of this ordinance or to conditions or
UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Chapter 6 254
commitments attached to its approval. An application to terminate may be filed by an interested person, or a staff member or an Administrative Officer. The ABZA may take this action only at a public hearing, having given notice of that hearing to the property owner.
(k) There can be no applications or classes of cases, nor any particular situation in which this ordinance authorizes either special uses, contingent uses or conditional uses.
6-4-5 VARIANCES:
(a)
Rules regarding filing procedures and required public notice involved in applying for a grant of variance are part of the bylaws of the ABZA, and are available from the ABZA staff and the Lafayette City Engineer's office.
(b)
The ABZA or ABZA-LD may grant a variance from the Zone Regulations and Additional Use Restrictions in Chapters 2 and 4 above (except subsections 2-9-4 and 2-10-4, the R3U and R3W density caps; 2-10-11 and 2-11-11, the R3W and R4W maximum building height; 2-26, Flood Plain Zones; 2-27 Planned Development Zones; and 2-28-14 Rural Estate Zones, Additional Requirements) if, after a public hearing, it makes findings of facts in writing, that (Amends 18, 27):
(1)
the APC or its Executive Committee has determined that the variance applied for is not a use variance, i.e. a variance from the Permitted Use Table in 3-2 above as prohibited by
I.C. 36-7-4-916 and 918.3 (Amend 15); and
(2)
the approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community; and
(3)
the use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner; and
(4)
the terms of this ordinance are being applied to a situation that is not common to other properties in the same zone; and
(5)
the strict application of the terms of the ordinance will result in an unusual and unnecessary hardship; and
(6)
the hardship involved is as defined in 1-10 above, and is neither self-imposed nor solely based on a perceived reduction of or restriction on economic gain; and
(7)
the variance sought provides only the minimum relief needed to alleviate the petitioner's hardship.
(c)
The ABZA or ABZA-LD may permit or require a property owner and/or the petitioner to make a written commitment concerning the use or development of that property or may impose conditions upon the grant of variance.
Chapter 6 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 255
(d)
A variance granted by the ABZA or ABZA-LD applies only to the situation illustrated in the petitioner's site plan. It runs with the property (rather than the property owner or petitioner), but ceases to be authorized and becomes void when:
(1)
the use of the variance ends;
(2)
the property conforms with this ordinance as written; or
(3)
the condition of the site changes so that it no longer conforms to the previously approved site plan.
(e)
Where an owner and/or petitioner has failed to comply with any condition and/or commitment permitted or required by the grant of variance, the ABZA or ABZA-LD may authorize action it deems appropriate to obtain compliance by the owner and/or petitioner with the condition or commitment of the grant, or with the terms of this ordinance, in the same manner as if the variance had not been granted.
6-4-6 APPEALS:
(a)
Rules regarding filing procedures and required public notice involved in filing an appeal with the ABZA are part of ABZA's bylaws, and are available from the ABZA staff.
(b)
On an appeal under 6-4-1-d above, the ABZA may make any decision that an Administrative Officer might have made.
(c)
All appeals from the decisions of the ABZA, or from a decision concerning variances of the ABZA-LD, shall be made pursuant to
I.C. 36-7-4-1000 through 1020 (Amend 15). No appeals from the decision of the ABZA-LD within its jurisdiction, can be made to the ABZA.

(e) Surety shall be reduced upon actual acceptance of public improvements or improvements for common usage, but only by the amount originally estimated for completion of those improvements.
B-4-8 MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
(a)
The petitioner shall be required to maintain all public improvements on individual platted lots and provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of public improvements by the participating jurisdiction.
(b)
The petitioner shall be required to file a maintenance bond, for a period of 3 years, with the participating jurisdiction, prior to acceptance, in an amount not to exceed 10% of the cost of all public improvements, and in a form satisfactory to the participating jurisdiction. This is to assure the satisfactory condition of the required public improvements for a period of 3 years after the date of their acceptance by the participating jurisdiction.
B-4-9 ISSUANCE OF IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMITS:
(a)
No improvement location permit shall be issued for a dwelling unit unless surety for public improvements has been filed, and the plat recorded.
(b)
No improvement location permit shall be issued for the last 10% of lots in a recorded plat, or phase, part or section of a plat (or the last 2 lots if 10% is less than 2), until all public improvements other than sidewalks, and all improvements for common usage have been fully completed and accepted for maintenance by the participating jurisdiction or homeowners association.

APPENDIX D-1: COMPUTING SIGN AREA
PER SIGN-LOT
D-1 ON-PREMISE SIGN SIZE REQUIREMENTS
D-1-1 BASIC INFORMATION:
(a)
Total sign area depends on the specifics of a situation. The zoning ordinance recognizes that:
(1)
heavier duty business zones need bigger signs;
(2)
faster roads need bigger signs; and
(3)
buildings set further back from the road need bigger signs.
(b)
The ordinance provides rewards for minimizing clutter by minimizing the use of freestanding signs.
(c)
The ordinance determines total square footage of sign area per primary use, but the number of signs used is entirely at the discretion of the land owner or occupant.
(d)
Should the primary use occupy more than one frontage, then the total for all frontages is added together, yet may be distributed to these frontages at the discretion of the land owner or occupant.
D-1-2 CALCULATING SIGN AREA:
(a)
Regardless of calculations, one is guaranteed a minimum sign area, called a sign area assurance. For the most part, sign area assurance equals the zonal base rate shown as Item A. in the following table, D-2 (Amend 5). These are exceptions:
(1)
Ifa primary use building in an NBU or MRU zone has a ground floor area of more than 15000 sq.ft,, sign area assurance is calculated as 0.2% of that ground floor area (.002 x GFA).
(2)
Ifa primary use building in any other commercial zone, or in any industrial zone, has a ground floor area of more than 20000 sq.ft., sign area assurance is calculated as 0.2% of that ground floor area (.002 x ground floor area).
(b)
Similarly, one is limited to a maximum amount of signage, called a sign area cap. This comes into use when the calculated maximum sign area per sign-lot exceeds 6% of the ground floor area of the primary use building. Signage is then limited to 6% of GFA.
(c)
An institutional land use (SIC Code numbers 801 through 972), operating in a residential or rural zone, has a zonal base rate of 20.
(d)
In calculating the road speed limit multiplier (Item B in D-2 below), if the official road speed limit changes along the length of a uses frontage, the greater of the speed limits shall be used. (Amend 20)
Appendix UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION 277
(e)
Where a sign-lot has no actual street frontage, the road speed limit multiplier is derived from that of the adjoining road or roads from which the primary use derives its access, at that point of access.
(f)
Frontage along I-65 does not count in this calculation.
(g)
If the speed limit increases after signs are installed, permitted sign area may be recalculated and increased. If the speed limit decreases, there shall be no requirement to reduce sign area.
(h)
Building setback for the building setback multiplier (Item C), shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way to the nearest wall (or gas station canopy).
(i)
4-8-6 above indicates how much of sign area is permitted to be freestanding (Item D). The owner or occupant shall then figure:
(1)
what percentage of the full allowance is intended to be used; and thus
(2)
the multiplier to be awarded for minimizing freestanding signage.
(j)
(Deleted, Amend 20)
278 UNIFIED ZONING ORDINANCE, 3rd EDITION Appendix D-2 CALCULATING MAXIMUM SIGN AREA FOR A SIGN-LOT (Amend 20) Step 1: Calculate A x B x C x D (for every frontage) = E Step 2: Calculate .06 x GROUND FLOOR AREA of the primary use building; enter it as F: only if it is less than E; leave F blank if it is more than or equal to E. Step 3: Maximum sign area = the lesser of E and F. A. multiplied by: B. multiplied by: 0 to 59 = 1.0 201 to 300 = 2.5 60 to100 = 1.1 301 to 400 = 3.0 C. 101 to 150 = 1.25 401 to 500 = 3.5 151 to 200 = 1.75 501 or more = 4.0 M multiplied by: D. if you have FRONTAGE 1 FRONTAGE 2 A. multiplied by: B. multiplied by: C. A D. The FRSTNDNG SIGN USE FACTOR is (See 4-8-6): multiplied by: Y bldg. setback less than 25 = NA (Amend 5) A 0% of allowance = 1.3 D. P 1 to 50% = 1.2 P 51 to 75% = 1.1 L 76% or more = 1.0 + Y = YOUR MAXIMUM SIGN AREA PER SIGN-LOT IS E UNLESS YOU NEED TO FIGURE F. but no less than your SIGN AREA ASSURANCE If 6% of the GROUND FLOOR AREA of your PRINCIPAL USE BUILDING is less than the total in E, then you have a F. SIGN AREA CAP (.06 x GFA = F) instead.
A. The ZONAL BASE RATE is:
R1, R1A, R1B, R1U, R1Z, R2, R2U, RE (Am 27) = 6 sq.ft.
A
R3, R3W, R3U, R4W = 20 sq.ft.
